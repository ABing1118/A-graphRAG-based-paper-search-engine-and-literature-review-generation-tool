    "title": "From Local to Global: A Graph RAG Approach to Query-Focused Summarization",
    "abstract": "The use of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to retrieve relevant information from an external knowledge source enables large language models (LLMs) to answer questions over private and/or previously unseen document collections. However, RAG fails on global questions directed at an entire text corpus, such as\"What are the main themes in the dataset?\", since this is inherently a query-focused summarization (QFS) task, rather than an explicit retrieval task. Prior QFS methods, meanwhile, fail to scale to the quantities of text indexed by typical RAG systems. To combine the strengths of these contrasting methods, we propose a Graph RAG approach to question answering over private text corpora that scales with both the generality of user questions and the quantity of source text to be indexed. Our approach uses an LLM to build a graph-based text index in two stages: first to derive an entity knowledge graph from the source documents, then to pregenerate community summaries for all groups of closely-related entities. Given a question, each community summary is used to generate a partial response, before all partial responses are again summarized in a final response to the user. For a class of global sensemaking questions over datasets in the 1 million token range, we show that Graph RAG leads to substantial improvements over a na\\\"ive RAG baseline for both the comprehensiveness and diversity of generated answers. An open-source, Python-based implementation of both global and local Graph RAG approaches is forthcoming at https://aka.ms/graphrag.",

    "title": "RAFT: Adapting Language Model to Domain Specific RAG",
    "abstract": "Pretraining Large Language Models (LLMs) on large corpora of textual data is now a standard paradigm. When using these LLMs for many downstream applications, it is common to additionally bake in new knowledge (e.g., time-critical news, or private domain knowledge) into the pretrained model either through RAG-based-prompting, or fine-tuning. However, the optimal methodology for the model to gain such new knowledge remains an open question. In this paper, we present Retrieval Augmented FineTuning (RAFT), a training recipe that improves the model's ability to answer questions in a\"open-book\"in-domain settings. In RAFT, given a question, and a set of retrieved documents, we train the model to ignore those documents that don't help in answering the question, which we call, distractor documents. RAFT accomplishes this by citing verbatim the right sequence from the relevant document that would help answer the question. This coupled with RAFT's chain-of-thought-style response helps improve the model's ability to reason. In domain-specific RAG, RAFT consistently improves the model's performance across PubMed, HotpotQA, and Gorilla datasets, presenting a post-training recipe to improve pre-trained LLMs to in-domain RAG. RAFT's code and demo are open-sourced at github.com/ShishirPatil/gorilla.",

    "title": "Self-RAG: Learning to Retrieve, Generate, and Critique through Self-Reflection",
    "abstract": "Despite their remarkable capabilities, large language models (LLMs) often produce responses containing factual inaccuracies due to their sole reliance on the parametric knowledge they encapsulate. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), an ad hoc approach that augments LMs with retrieval of relevant knowledge, decreases such issues. However, indiscriminately retrieving and incorporating a fixed number of retrieved passages, regardless of whether retrieval is necessary, or passages are relevant, diminishes LM versatility or can lead to unhelpful response generation. We introduce a new framework called Self-Reflective Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Self-RAG) that enhances an LM's quality and factuality through retrieval and self-reflection. Our framework trains a single arbitrary LM that adaptively retrieves passages on-demand, and generates and reflects on retrieved passages and its own generations using special tokens, called reflection tokens. Generating reflection tokens makes the LM controllable during the inference phase, enabling it to tailor its behavior to diverse task requirements. Experiments show that Self-RAG (7B and 13B parameters) significantly outperforms state-of-the-art LLMs and retrieval-augmented models on a diverse set of tasks. Specifically, Self-RAG outperforms ChatGPT and retrieval-augmented Llama2-chat on Open-domain QA, reasoning and fact verification tasks, and it shows significant gains in improving factuality and citation accuracy for long-form generations relative to these models.",

    "title": "The Power of Noise: Redefining Retrieval for RAG Systems",
    "abstract": "Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has recently emerged as a method to extend beyond the pre-trained knowledge of Large Language Models by augmenting the original prompt with relevant passages or documents retrieved by an Information Retrieval (IR) system. RAG has become increasingly important for Generative AI solutions, especially in enterprise settings or in any domain in which knowledge is constantly refreshed and cannot be memorized in the LLM. We argue here that the retrieval component of RAG systems, be it dense or sparse, deserves increased attention from the research community, and accordingly, we conduct the first comprehensive and systematic examination of the retrieval strategy of RAG systems. We focus, in particular, on the type of passages IR systems within a RAG solution should retrieve. Our analysis considers multiple factors, such as the relevance of the passages included in the prompt context, their position, and their number. One counter-intuitive finding of this work is that the retriever's highest-scoring documents that are not directly relevant to the query (e.g., do not contain the answer) negatively impact the effectiveness of the LLM. Even more surprising, we discovered that adding random documents in the prompt improves the LLM accuracy by up to 35%. These results highlight the need to investigate the appropriate strategies when integrating retrieval with LLMs, thereby laying the groundwork for future research in this area.",

    "title": "A Survey on RAG Meeting LLMs: Towards Retrieval-Augmented Large Language Models",
    "abstract": "As one of the most advanced techniques in AI, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) can offer reliable and up-to-date external knowledge, providing huge convenience for numerous tasks. Particularly in the era of AI-Generated Content (AIGC), the powerful capacity of retrieval in providing additional knowledge enables RAG to assist existing generative AI in producing high-quality outputs. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated revolutionary abilities in language understanding and generation, while still facing inherent limitations, such as hallucinations and out-of-date internal knowledge. Given the powerful abilities of RAG in providing the latest and helpful auxiliary information, Retrieval-Augmented Large Language Models (RA-LLMs) have emerged to harness external and authoritative knowledge bases, rather than solely relying on the model's internal knowledge, to augment the generation quality of LLMs. In this survey, we comprehensively review existing research studies in RA-LLMs, covering three primary technical perspectives: architectures, training strategies, and applications. As the preliminary knowledge, we briefly introduce the foundations and recent advances of LLMs. Then, to illustrate the practical significance of RAG for LLMs, we systematically review mainstream relevant work by their architectures, training strategies, and application areas, detailing specifically the challenges of each and the corresponding capabilities of RA-LLMs. Finally, to deliver deeper insights, we discuss current limitations and several promising directions for future research.

    "title": "MultiHop-RAG: Benchmarking Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Multi-Hop Queries",
    "abstract": "Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) augments large language models (LLM) by retrieving relevant knowledge, showing promising potential in mitigating LLM hallucinations and enhancing response quality, thereby facilitating the great adoption of LLMs in practice. However, we find that existing RAG systems are inadequate in answering multi-hop queries, which require retrieving and reasoning over multiple pieces of supporting evidence. Furthermore, to our knowledge, no existing RAG benchmarking dataset focuses on multi-hop queries. In this paper, we develop a novel dataset, MultiHop-RAG, which consists of a knowledge base, a large collection of multi-hop queries, their ground-truth answers, and the associated supporting evidence. We detail the procedure of building the dataset, utilizing an English news article dataset as the underlying RAG knowledge base. We demonstrate the benchmarking utility of MultiHop-RAG in two experiments. The first experiment compares different embedding models for retrieving evidence for multi-hop queries. In the second experiment, we examine the capabilities of various state-of-the-art LLMs, including GPT-4, PaLM, and Llama2-70B, in reasoning and answering multi-hop queries given the evidence. Both experiments reveal that existing RAG methods perform unsatisfactorily in retrieving and answering multi-hop queries. We hope MultiHop-RAG will be a valuable resource for the community in developing effective RAG systems, thereby facilitating greater adoption of LLMs in practice. The MultiHop-RAG and implemented RAG system is publicly available at https://github.com/yixuantt/MultiHop-RAG/.",

    "title": "RAG vs Fine-tuning: Pipelines, Tradeoffs, and a Case Study on Agriculture",
    "abstract": "There are two common ways in which developers are incorporating proprietary and domain-specific data when building applications of Large Language Models (LLMs): Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Fine-Tuning. RAG augments the prompt with the external data, while fine-Tuning incorporates the additional knowledge into the model itself. However, the pros and cons of both approaches are not well understood. In this paper, we propose a pipeline for fine-tuning and RAG, and present the tradeoffs of both for multiple popular LLMs, including Llama2-13B, GPT-3.5, and GPT-4. Our pipeline consists of multiple stages, including extracting information from PDFs, generating questions and answers, using them for fine-tuning, and leveraging GPT-4 for evaluating the results. We propose metrics to assess the performance of different stages of the RAG and fine-Tuning pipeline. We conduct an in-depth study on an agricultural dataset. Agriculture as an industry has not seen much penetration of AI, and we study a potentially disruptive application - what if we could provide location-specific insights to a farmer? Our results show the effectiveness of our dataset generation pipeline in capturing geographic-specific knowledge, and the quantitative and qualitative benefits of RAG and fine-tuning. We see an accuracy increase of over 6 p.p. when fine-tuning the model and this is cumulative with RAG, which increases accuracy by 5 p.p. further. In one particular experiment, we also demonstrate that the fine-tuned model leverages information from across geographies to answer specific questions, increasing answer similarity from 47% to 72%. Overall, the results point to how systems built using LLMs can be adapted to respond and incorporate knowledge across a dimension that is critical for a specific industry, paving the way for further applications of LLMs in other industrial domains.",

Whereas extensive research has demonstrated the privacy risks of large language models (LLMs), the RAG technique could potentially reshape the inherent behaviors of LLM generation, posing new privacy issues that are currently under-explored. In this work, we conduct extensive empirical studies with novel attack methods, which demonstrate the vulnerability of RAG systems on leaking the private retrieval database. Despite the new risk brought by RAG on the retrieval data, we further reveal that RAG can mitigate the leakage of the LLMs' training data.

    "title": "ChatQA: Surpassing GPT-4 on Conversational QA and RAG",
    "abstract": "In this work, we introduce ChatQA, a suite of models that outperform GPT-4 on retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and conversational question answering (QA). To enhance generation, we propose a two-stage instruction tuning method that significantly boosts the performance of RAG. For effective retrieval, we introduce a dense retriever optimized for conversational QA, which yields results comparable to the alternative state-of-the-art query rewriting models, while substantially reducing deployment costs. We also present the ChatRAG Bench, which encompasses ten datasets covering comprehensive evaluations on RAG, table-related QA, arithmetic calculations, and scenarios involving unanswerable questions. Our ChatQA-1.0-70B (score: 54.14), built on Llama2, a weaker foundation model than GPT-4, can slightly outperform GPT-4-0613 (score: 53.90) and GPT-4-Turbo-2024-04-09 (score: 54.03) on the ChatRAG Bench, without relying on any synthetic data from OpenAI GPT models. Notably, the Llama3-ChatQA-1.5-70B model surpasses the accuracy of GPT-4-Turbo-2024-04-09, achieving a 4.4% improvement. To advance research in this field, we open-sourced the model weights, instruction tuning data, ChatRAG Bench, and retriever for the community: https://chatqa-project.github.io/.",

    "abstract": "Infineon has identified a need for engineers, account managers, and customers to rapidly obtain product information. This problem is traditionally addressed with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) chatbots, but in this study, I evaluated the use of the newly popularized RAG-Fusion method. RAG-Fusion combines RAG and reciprocal rank fusion (RRF) by generating multiple queries, reranking them with reciprocal scores and fusing the documents and scores. Through manually evaluating answers on accuracy, relevance, and comprehensiveness, I found that RAG-Fusion was able to provide accurate and comprehensive answers due to the generated queries contextualizing the original query from various perspectives. However, some answers strayed off topic when the generated queries' relevance to the original query is insufficient. This research marks significant progress in artificial intelligence (AI) and natural language processing (NLP) applications and demonstrates transformations in a global and multiindustry context.",

    "title": "GNN-RAG: Graph Neural Retrieval for Large Language Model Reasoning",
    "abstract": "Knowledge Graphs (KGs) represent human-crafted factual knowledge in the form of triplets (head, relation, tail), which collectively form a graph. Question Answering over KGs (KGQA) is the task of answering natural questions grounding the reasoning to the information provided by the KG. Large Language Models (LLMs) are the state-of-the-art models for QA tasks due to their remarkable ability to understand natural language. On the other hand, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been widely used for KGQA as they can handle the complex graph information stored in the KG. In this work, we introduce GNN-RAG, a novel method for combining language understanding abilities of LLMs with the reasoning abilities of GNNs in a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) style. First, a GNN reasons over a dense KG subgraph to retrieve answer candidates for a given question. Second, the shortest paths in the KG that connect question entities and answer candidates are extracted to represent KG reasoning paths. The extracted paths are verbalized and given as input for LLM reasoning with RAG. In our GNN-RAG framework, the GNN acts as a dense subgraph reasoner to extract useful graph information, while the LLM leverages its natural language processing ability for ultimate KGQA. Furthermore, we develop a retrieval augmentation (RA) technique to further boost KGQA performance with GNN-RAG. Experimental results show that GNN-RAG achieves state-of-the-art performance in two widely used KGQA benchmarks (WebQSP and CWQ), outperforming or matching GPT-4 performance with a 7B tuned LLM. In addition, GNN-RAG excels on multi-hop and multi-entity questions outperforming competing approaches by 8.9--15.5% points at answer F1.",

    "title": "RQ-RAG: Learning to Refine Queries for Retrieval Augmented Generation",
    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit remarkable capabilities but are prone to generating inaccurate or hallucinatory responses. This limitation stems from their reliance on vast pretraining datasets, making them susceptible to errors in unseen scenarios. To tackle these challenges, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) addresses this by incorporating external, relevant documents into the response generation process, thus leveraging non-parametric knowledge alongside LLMs' in-context learning abilities. However, existing RAG implementations primarily focus on initial input for context retrieval, overlooking the nuances of ambiguous or complex queries that necessitate further clarification or decomposition for accurate responses. To this end, we propose learning to Refine Query for Retrieval Augmented Generation (RQ-RAG) in this paper, endeavoring to enhance the model by equipping it with capabilities for explicit rewriting, decomposition, and disambiguation. Our experimental results indicate that our method, when applied to a 7B Llama2 model, surpasses the previous state-of-the-art (SOTA) by an average of 1.9\\% across three single-hop QA datasets, and also demonstrates enhanced performance in handling complex, multi-hop QA datasets.

Addressing the challenge of LLM hallucinations, we finetune models with a curated dataset which originates from CMU's extensive resources and annotated with the teacher model. Our experiments demonstrate the system's effectiveness in generating more accurate answers to domain-specific and time-sensitive inquiries. The results also revealed the limitations of fine-tuning LLMs with small-scale and skewed datasets.

    "title": "CRUD-RAG: A Comprehensive Chinese Benchmark for Retrieval-Augmented Generation of Large Language Models",
    "abstract": "\n Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a technique that enhances the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) by incorporating external knowledge sources. This method addresses common LLM limitations, including outdated information and the tendency to produce inaccurate “hallucinated” content. However, evaluating RAG systems is a challenge. Most benchmarks focus primarily on question answering applications, neglecting other potential scenarios where RAG could be beneficial. Accordingly, in the experiments, these benchmarks often assess only the LLM components of the RAG pipeline or the retriever in knowledge-intensive scenarios, overlooking the impact of external knowledge base construction and the retrieval component on the entire RAG pipeline in non-knowledge-intensive scenarios. To address these issues, this paper constructs a large-scale and more comprehensive benchmark, and evaluates all the components of RAG systems in various RAG application scenarios. Specifically, we refer to the CRUD actions that describe interactions between users and knowledge bases, and also categorize the range of RAG applications into four distinct types–Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD). “Create” refers to scenarios requiring the generation of original, varied content. “Read” involves responding to intricate questions in knowledge-intensive situations. “Update” focuses on revising and rectifying inaccuracies or inconsistencies in pre-existing texts. “Delete” pertains to the task of summarizing extensive texts into more concise forms. For each of these CRUD categories, we have developed different datasets to evaluate the performance of RAG systems. We also analyze the effects of various components of the RAG system, such as the retriever, context length, knowledge base construction, and LLM. Finally, we provide useful insights for optimizing the RAG technology for different scenarios\n \n 1\n \n .\n",

    "abstract": "Despite the impressive capabilities of large language models (LLMs) across diverse applications, they still suffer from trustworthiness issues, such as hallucinations and misalignments. Retrieval-augmented language models (RAG) have been proposed to enhance the credibility of generations by grounding external knowledge, but the theoretical understandings of their generation risks remains unexplored. In this paper, we answer: 1) whether RAG can indeed lead to low generation risks, 2) how to provide provable guarantees on the generation risks of RAG and vanilla LLMs, and 3) what sufficient conditions enable RAG models to reduce generation risks. We propose C-RAG, the first framework to certify generation risks for RAG models. Specifically, we provide conformal risk analysis for RAG models and certify an upper confidence bound of generation risks, which we refer to as conformal generation risk. We also provide theoretical guarantees on conformal generation risks for general bounded risk functions under test distribution shifts. We prove that RAG achieves a lower conformal generation risk than that of a single LLM when the quality of the retrieval model and transformer is non-trivial. Our intensive empirical results demonstrate the soundness and tightness of our conformal generation risk guarantees across four widely-used NLP datasets on four state-of-the-art retrieval models.",

    "title": "Blended RAG: Improving RAG (Retriever-Augmented Generation) Accuracy with Semantic Search and Hybrid Query-Based Retrievers",
    "abstract": "Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a prevalent approach to infuse a private knowledge base of documents with Large Language Models (LLM) to build Generative Q&A (Question-Answering) systems. However, RAG accuracy becomes increasingly challenging as the corpus of documents scales up, with Retrievers playing an outsized role in the overall RAG accuracy by extracting the most relevant document from the corpus to provide context to the LLM. In this paper, we propose the ‘Blended RAG’ method of leveraging semantic search techniques, such as Dense Vector indexes and Sparse Encoder indexes, blended with hybrid query strategies. Our study achieves better retrieval results and sets new benchmarks for IR (Information Retrieval) datasets like NQ and TREC-COVID datasets. We further extend such a ‘Blended Retriever’ to the RAG system to demonstrate far superior results on Generative Q&A datasets like SQUAD, even surpassing fine-tuning performance.",

    "title": "The Rag GTPases Bind Raptor and Mediate Amino Acid Signaling to mTORC1",
    "abstract": "The multiprotein mTORC1 protein kinase complex is the central component of a pathway that promotes growth in response to insulin, energy levels, and amino acids and is deregulated in common cancers. We find that the Rag proteins—a family of four related small guanosine triphosphatases (GTPases)—interact with mTORC1 in an amino acid–sensitive manner and are necessary for the activation of the mTORC1 pathway by amino acids. A Rag mutant that is constitutively bound to guanosine triphosphate interacted strongly with mTORC1, and its expression within cells made the mTORC1 pathway resistant to amino acid deprivation. Conversely, expression of a guanosine diphosphate–bound Rag mutant prevented stimulation of mTORC1 by amino acids. The Rag proteins do not directly stimulate the kinase activity of mTORC1, but, like amino acids, promote the intracellular localization of mTOR to a compartment that also contains its activator Rheb.",

    "title": "Improving the Domain Adaptation of Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) Models for Open Domain Question Answering",
    "abstract": "Retrieval Augment Generation (RAG) is a recent advancement in Open-Domain Question Answering (ODQA). RAG has only been trained and explored with a Wikipedia-based external knowledge base and is not optimized for use in other specialized domains such as healthcare and news. In this paper, we evaluate the impact of joint training of the retriever and generator components of RAG for the task of domain adaptation in ODQA. We propose RAG-end2end, an extension to RAG that can adapt to a domain-specific knowledge base by updating all components of the external knowledge base during training. In addition, we introduce an auxiliary training signal to inject more domain-specific knowledge. This auxiliary signal forces RAG-end2end to reconstruct a given sentence by accessing the relevant information from the external knowledge base. Our novel contribution is that, unlike RAG, RAG-end2end does joint training of the retriever and generator for the end QA task and domain adaptation. We evaluate our approach with datasets from three domains: COVID-19, News, and Conversations, and achieve significant performance improvements compared to the original RAG model. Our work has been open-sourced through the HuggingFace Transformers library, attesting to our work’s credibility and technical consistency.",

    "title": "The lysosomal Rag-Ragulator complex licenses RIPK1– and caspase-8–mediated pyroptosis by Yersinia",
    "abstract": "Cell death limits pathogens During infection, Yersinia inhibition of the protein kinase TAK1 triggers cleavage of the pore-forming protein gasdermin D (GSDMD), which leads to a kind of inflammatory cell death called pyroptosis. In a genome-wide screen, Zheng et al. identified a lysosome-tethered regulatory supercomplex as being a critical driver of Yersinia-induced pyroptosis. The activity of the GTPase Rag and lysosomal tethering of Rag-Ragulator were required to recruit and activate the kinase RIPK1 and protease caspase-8 to cleave GSDMD, which causes cell death and limits infection. By contrast, Rag-Ragulator was not required for inflammasome-mediated pyroptosis. Thus, metabolic signaling on lysosomes can regulate cell death during pathogenic bacterial infection. Science, abg0269, this issue p. eabg0269 The lysosomal metabolic signaling regulator Rag-Ragulator instructs the host inflammatory response to the pathogenic bacterium Yersinia. INTRODUCTION An inflammatory innate immune response is a first line of host defense against invading pathogens. Inflammation recruits immune cells to the infection site and activates protective adaptive immune responses. Invasive bacteria have evolved multiple ways to interfere with host innate immune signaling to facilitate infection. The Yersinia effector protein YopJ suppresses proinflammatory cytokine production by inhibiting transforming growth factor–β–activated kinase 1 (TAK1) and nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) activation. To counteract this virulence factor, host cells initiate receptor-interacting serine-threonine protein kinase 1 (RIPK1)–dependent caspase-8–directed gasdermin D (GSDMD) cleavage and inflammatory cell death (pyroptosis) when TAK1 is inhibited. However, how the RIPK1–caspase-8–GSDMD axis is instructed during Yersinia infection is unclear. RATIONALE The best-studied mechanism by which pathogens stimulate inflammatory cell death involves triggering cytosolic sensors, called inflammasomes, which activate inflammatory caspases (1/4/5/11) to process proinflammatory cytokines and cause pyroptosis. Inflammatory caspase cleavage of GSDMD causes cell membrane pores that mediate both pyroptosis and proinflammatory cytokine secretion. An alternate pyroptotic pathway, mediated by activation of RIPK1 and caspase-8, is triggered when the YopJ virulence factor secreted during pathogenic Yersinia infection blocks TAK1 activation. To determine the molecular mechanisms underlying Yersinia activation of RIPK1–caspase-8–dependent pyroptosis, we performed a genome-wide CRISPR screen using Cas9-expressing immortalized mouse bone marrow–derived macrophages infected with a genome-wide library of single-guide RNA–encoding lentiviruses. The genomes of cells resistant to caspase-8– or caspase-11–dependent pyroptosis were sequenced to identify the knocked-out genes required for pyroptosis. RESULTS The screen identified multiple genes in the lysosomal membrane–anchored Folliculin (Flcn)–Folliculin-interacting protein 2 (Fnip2)–Rag-Ragulator complex as necessary for caspase-8– but not caspase-11–mediated pyroptosis. Deficiency of Rag-Ragulator complex genes rendered cells highly resistant to TAK1 inhibition–triggered pyroptosis, indicating a critical and unexpected role of the lysosomal membrane–tethered Rag-Ragulator supercomplex in RIPK1-dependent caspase-8–directed pyroptosis. In response to pathogenic Yersinia or its mimic [lipopolysaccharide (LPS) plus TAK1 inhibitor], a Fas-associated death domain (FADD)–RIPK1–caspase-8–containing complex was recruited to lysosomal membrane–tethered Rag-Ragulator. Activation of RIPK1 phosphorylation, caspase-8 activation, and pyroptosis depended on Rag guanosine triphosphatase (GTPase) activity and Rag-Ragulator lysosomal binding but was independent of the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1), a well-known Rag-Ragulator–regulated complex. By contrast, Rag-Ragulator did not regulate canonical or noncanonical inflammasome-triggered pyroptosis. CONCLUSION Our study revealed an instructive role of metabolic signaling in directing TAK1 inhibition–induced pyroptosis during a pathogenic bacterial infection. Rag-Ragulator is a well-known critical regulator of cellular responses to changes in nutrient availability and metabolism. Here, Rag-Ragulator served as a platform for activating a FADD–RIPK1–caspase-8 complex formed in response to Toll-like receptor (TLR) or tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR) ligation. Rag GTPase activity was critical for triggering the pathway. The role found here for Rag-Ragulator in pyroptosis expands its known roles in metabolic regulation to include regulation of the response to pathogenic infection. Rag-Ragulator monitors both metabolism and infection to serve as a central hub for helping to decide whether available nutrients are adequate for cell proliferation and if an infected cell should die and send out inflammatory danger signals. Future studies can further explore the conditions that stimulate caspase-8–mediated pyroptosis and provide more mechanistic details of how it is regulated, as well as investigate whether manipulating this pathway could have therapeutic benefit. Rag-Ragulator serves as a platform for activating a FADD–RIPK1–caspase-8 complex to trigger pyroptosis in response to TLR and TNFR ligation. When TAK1 is inhibited by the Yersinia effector YopJ or its mimic 5z-7-oxozeaenol (5z7), a FADD–RIPK1–caspase-8–containing complex is recruited to lysosome-tethered Rag-Ragulator, which activates caspase-8– and GSDMD-dependent pyroptosis. TNFRSF, TNFR superfamily; L1-5, Lamtor1-5. Host cells initiate cell death programs to limit pathogen infection. Inhibition of transforming growth factor–β–activated kinase 1 (TAK1) by pathogenic Yersinia in macrophages triggers receptor-interacting serine-threonine protein kinase 1 (RIPK1)–dependent caspase-8 cleavage of gasdermin D (GSDMD) and inflammatory cell death (pyroptosis). A genome-wide CRISPR screen to uncover mediators of caspase-8–dependent pyroptosis identified an unexpected role of the lysosomal folliculin (FLCN)–folliculin-interacting protein 2 (FNIP2)–Rag-Ragulator supercomplex, which regulates metabolic signaling and the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1). In response to Yersinia infection, Fas-associated death domain (FADD), RIPK1, and caspase-8 were recruited to Rag-Ragulator, causing RIPK1 phosphorylation and caspase-8 activation. Pyroptosis activation depended on Rag guanosine triphosphatase activity and lysosomal tethering of Rag-Ragulator but not mTORC1. Thus, the lysosomal metabolic regulator Rag-Ragulator instructs the inflammatory response to Yersinia.",

    "title": "Glutamine and asparagine activate mTORC1 independently of Rag GTPases",
    "abstract": "Nutrient sensing by cells is crucial, and when this sensing mechanism is disturbed, human disease can occur. mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) senses amino acids to control cell growth, metabolism, and autophagy. Leucine, arginine, and methionine signal to mTORC1 through the well-characterized Rag GTPase signaling pathway. In contrast, glutamine activates mTORC1 through a Rag GTPase–independent mechanism that requires ADP-ribosylation factor 1 (Arf1). Here, using several biochemical and genetic approaches, we show that eight amino acids filter through the Rag GTPase pathway. Like glutamine, asparagine signals to mTORC1 through Arf1 in the absence of the Rag GTPases. Both the Rag-dependent and Rag-independent pathways required the lysosome and lysosomal function for mTORC1 activation. Our results show that mTORC1 is differentially regulated by amino acids through two distinct pathways.",

    "title": "Architecture of human Rag GTPase heterodimers and their complex with mTORC1",
    "abstract": "Mastering regulation The mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) is known as the master kinase, acknowledging its key role in integrating multiple signals to regulate cell growth. When nutrients are abundant, heterodimers of Rag, a class of small guanosine triphosphatase, bind to mTORC1 and recruit it to the lysosome. Here, other signaling pathways converge on the mTORC1 complex. Anandapadamanaban et al. determined cryo–electron microscopy and crystal structures of a RagA/RagC heterodimer. The structures, together with dynamic studies, explain the nucleotide states required for binding to mTORC1 and support a mechanism for conformational communication between the RagA and RagC subunits in the heterodimer. RagA/RagC binding causes no conformational change in mTORC1, which is consistent with the idea that mTORC1 must sense additional growth regulators before it is activated. Science, this issue p. 203 Rag heterodimer binding does not change mTORC1 conformation but activates mTORC1 by targeting it to lysosomes. The Rag guanosine triphosphatases (GTPases) recruit the master kinase mTORC1 to lysosomes to regulate cell growth and proliferation in response to amino acid availability. The nucleotide state of Rag heterodimers is critical for their association with mTORC1. Our cryo–electron microscopy structure of RagA/RagC in complex with mTORC1 shows the details of RagA/RagC binding to the RAPTOR subunit of mTORC1 and explains why only the RagAGTP/RagCGDP nucleotide state binds mTORC1. Previous kinetic studies suggested that GTP binding to one Rag locks the heterodimer to prevent GTP binding to the other. Our crystal structures and dynamics of RagA/RagC show the mechanism for this locking and explain how oncogenic hotspot mutations disrupt this process. In contrast to allosteric activation by RHEB, Rag heterodimer binding does not change mTORC1 conformation and activates mTORC1 by targeting it to lysosomes.",

    "abstract": "The RAG1 and RAG2 proteins initiate the process of V(D)J recombination and therefore play an essential role in adaptive immunity. While null mutations in the RAG genes cause severe combined immune deficiency with lack of T and B cells (T−B− SCID) and susceptibility to life‐threatening, early‐onset infections, studies in humans and mice have demonstrated that hypomorphic RAG mutations are associated with defects of central and peripheral tolerance resulting in immune dysregulation. In this review, we provide an overview of the extended spectrum of RAG deficiencies and their associated clinical and immunological phenotypes in humans. We discuss recent advances in the mechanisms that control RAG expression and function, the effects of perturbed RAG activity on lymphoid development and immune homeostasis, and propose novel approaches to correct this group of disorders.",

    "title": "The GATOR–Rag GTPase pathway inhibits mTORC1 activation by lysosome-derived amino acids",
    "abstract": "Intricacies of amino acid sensing The way in which cells sense amino acids derived from external proteins taken up by micropinocytosis and then degraded in the lysosome turns out to be different from the way in which they sense external amino acids taken up through transporters in the plasma membrane. Both sources of amino acids end up activating the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) protein kinase complex. However, Hesketh et al. found that cultured human cells sense amino acids derived from exogenous proteins in late endosomes by a mechanism independent of the Rag guanosine triphosphatases (GTPases) that control mTORC1 activation in response to external amino acids. Furthermore, the GATOR GTPase had an inhibitory effect on mTORC1 activation in response to proteins processed through the lysosome, opposite to its role in sensing amino acids taken up across the plasma membrane. Science, this issue p. 351 How cells recognize amino acids derived from proteins processed in lysosomes is elucidated. The mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) couples nutrient sufficiency to cell growth. mTORC1 is activated by exogenously acquired amino acids sensed through the GATOR–Rag guanosine triphosphatase (GTPase) pathway, or by amino acids derived through lysosomal degradation of protein by a poorly defined mechanism. Here, we revealed that amino acids derived from the degradation of protein (acquired through oncogenic Ras-driven macropinocytosis) activate mTORC1 by a Rag GTPase–independent mechanism. mTORC1 stimulation through this pathway required the HOPS complex and was negatively regulated by activation of the GATOR-Rag GTPase pathway. Therefore, distinct but functionally coordinated pathways control mTORC1 activity on late endocytic organelles in response to distinct sources of amino acids.",

    "title": "Ragulator and SLC38A9 activate the Rag GTPases through noncanonical GEF mechanisms",
    "abstract": "Significance Amino acids are basic building blocks for all organisms and are essential for cell growth and proliferation. Cells use a set of protein machines to sense the availability of amino acids to carry out basic responses. In particular, the mTORC1 pathway is a central sensor of amino acids in mammalian cells. Residing on the lysosomal surface upon activation, mTORC1 processes signals from the upstream Rag GTPases and stimulates downstream effectors through phosphorylation cascades. Ragulator and SLC38A9 are key components of the lysosomal branch of the amino acid-sensing machinery upstream of the Rag GTPases, but how they regulate the Rag GTPases at the molecular level remains poorly understood. Here we used kinetic analyses to define their functions. The mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) growth pathway detects nutrients through a variety of sensors and regulators that converge on the Rag GTPases, which form heterodimers consisting of RagA or RagB tightly bound to RagC or RagD and control the subcellular localization of mTORC1. The Rag heterodimer uses a unique “locking” mechanism to stabilize its active (GTPRagA–RagCGDP) or inactive (GDPRagA–RagCGTP) nucleotide states. The Ragulator complex tethers the Rag heterodimer to the lysosomal surface, and the SLC38A9 transmembrane protein is a lysosomal arginine sensor that upon activation stimulates mTORC1 activity through the Rag GTPases. How Ragulator and SLC38A9 control the nucleotide loading state of the Rag GTPases remains incompletely understood. Here we find that Ragulator and SLC38A9 are each unique guanine exchange factors (GEFs) that collectively push the Rag GTPases toward the active state. Ragulator triggers GTP release from RagC, thus resolving the locked inactivated state of the Rag GTPases. Upon arginine binding, SLC38A9 converts RagA from the GDP- to the GTP-loaded state, and therefore activates the Rag GTPase heterodimer. Altogether, Ragulator and SLC38A9 act on the Rag GTPases to activate the mTORC1 pathway in response to nutrient sufficiency.",

    "title": "The transcription factor E2A activates multiple enhancers that drive Rag expression in developing T and B cells",
    "abstract": "Distinct enhancer modules drive expression of Rag genes during T and B cell development (see the related Focus by Wang and Rothenberg). To each their own Recombination activating genes (RAGs) RAG1 and RAG2 play central roles in assembling functional T and B cell receptors in developing lymphocytes. Expression of Rag1 and Rag2 in hematopoiesis is restricted to these two lymphoid lineages, but precisely how this is accomplished has remained a mystery. Here, Miyazaki et al. have identified three key enhancer elements that recruit the transcription factor E2A to promote the expression of Rag1 and Rag2 genes during lymphocyte development. By generating mouse strains lacking one or more of these enhancer elements, they report that T and B cells use distinct enhancer modules to activate and maintain expression of Rag1 and Rag2 genes. Cell type–specific gene expression is driven by the interplay between lineage-specific transcription factors and cis-regulatory elements to which they bind. Adaptive immunity relies on RAG-mediated assembly of T cell receptor (TCR) and immunoglobulin (Ig) genes. Although Rag1 and Rag2 expression is largely restricted to adaptive lymphoid lineage cells, it remains unclear how Rag gene expression is regulated in a cell lineage–specific manner. Here, we identified three distinct cis-regulatory elements, a T cell lineage–specific enhancer (R-TEn) and the two B cell–specific elements, R1B and R2B. By generating mice lacking either R-TEn or R1B and R2B, we demonstrate that these distinct sets of regulatory elements drive the expression of Rag genes in developing T and B cells. What these elements have in common is their ability to bind the transcription factor E2A. By generating a mouse strain that carries a mutation within the E2A binding site of R-TEn, we demonstrate that recruitment of E2A to this site is essential for orchestrating changes in chromatin conformation that drive expression of Rag genes in T cells. By mapping cis-regulatory elements and generating multiple mouse strains lacking distinct enhancer elements, we demonstrate expression of Rag genes in developing T and B cells to be driven by distinct sets of E2A-dependent cis-regulatory modules.",

Lawrence et al. present a cryo–electron microscopy structure and biochemical experiments that reveal that the small GTPases act in unanticipated ways in the complex. The tumor suppressor folliculin (FLCN), along with FLCN-interacting protein 2, interacts with its partner GTPase RagC in both active and inactive states, suggesting that a particularly elaborate and stringent regulatory mechanism is at work. Science, this issue p. 971 An elaborate set of protein interactions controls nutrient sensing at the lysosome. The tumor suppressor folliculin (FLCN) enables nutrient-dependent activation of the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) protein kinase via its guanosine triphosphatase (GTPase) activating protein (GAP) activity toward the GTPase RagC. Concomitant with mTORC1 inactivation by starvation, FLCN relocalizes from the cytosol to lysosomes. To determine the lysosomal function of FLCN, we reconstituted the human lysosomal FLCN complex (LFC) containing FLCN, its partner FLCN-interacting protein 2 (FNIP2), and the RagAGDP:RagCGTP GTPases as they exist in the starved state with their lysosomal anchor Ragulator complex and determined its cryo–electron microscopy structure to 3.6 angstroms. The RagC-GAP activity of FLCN was inhibited within the LFC, owing to displacement of a catalytically required arginine in FLCN from the RagC nucleotide. Disassembly of the LFC and release of the RagC-GAP activity of FLCN enabled mTORC1-dependent regulation of the master regulator of lysosomal biogenesis, transcription factor E3, implicating the LFC as a checkpoint in mTORC1 signaling.",

    "title": "RAG-FW: A Hybrid Convolutional Framework for the Automated Extraction of Retinal Lesions and Lesion-Influenced Grading of Human Retinal Pathology",
    "abstract": "The identification of retinal lesions plays a vital role in accurately classifying and grading retinopathy. Many researchers have presented studies on optical coherence tomography (OCT) based retinal image analysis over the past. However, to the best of our knowledge, there is no framework yet available that can extract retinal lesions from multi-vendor OCT scans and utilize them for the intuitive severity grading of the human retina. To cater this lack, we propose a deep retinal analysis and grading framework (RAG-FW). RAG-FW is a hybrid convolutional framework that extracts multiple retinal lesions from OCT scans and utilizes them for lesion-influenced grading of retinopathy as per the clinical standards. RAG-FW has been rigorously tested on 43,613 scans from five highly complex publicly available datasets, containing multi-vendor scans, where it achieved the mean intersection-over-union score of 0.8055 for extracting the retinal lesions and the accuracy of 98.70% for the correct severity grading of retinopathy.",

    "title": "Arg-78 of Nprl2 catalyzes GATOR1-stimulated GTP hydrolysis by the Rag GTPases",
    "abstract": "mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) is a major regulator of cell growth and proliferation that coordinates nutrient inputs with anabolic and catabolic processes. Amino acid signals are transmitted to mTORC1 through the Rag GTPases, which directly recruit mTORC1 onto the lysosomal surface, its site of activation. The Rag GTPase heterodimer has a unique architecture that consists of two GTPase subunits, RagA or RagB bound to RagC or RagD. Their nucleotide-loading states are strictly controlled by several lysosomal or cytosolic protein complexes that directly detect and transmit the amino acid signals. GATOR1 (GTPase-activating protein (GAP) activity toward Rags-1), a negative regulator of the cytosolic branch of the nutrient-sensing pathway, comprises three subunits, Depdc5 (DEP domain–containing protein 5), Nprl2 (NPR2-like GATOR1 complex subunit), and Nprl3 (NPR3-like GATOR1 complex subunit), and is a GAP for RagA. GATOR1 binds the Rag GTPases via two modes: an inhibitory mode that holds the Rag GTPase heterodimer and has previously been captured by structural determination, and a GAP mode that stimulates GTP hydrolysis by RagA but remains structurally elusive. Here, using site-directed mutagenesis, GTP hydrolysis assays, coimmunoprecipitation experiments, and structural analysis, we probed the GAP mode and found that a critical residue on Nprl2, Arg-78, is the arginine finger that carries out GATOR1's GAP function. Substitutions of this arginine residue rendered mTORC1 signaling insensitive to amino acid starvation and are found frequently in cancers such as glioblastoma. Our results reveal the biochemical bases of mTORC1 inactivation through the GATOR1 complex.",

    "title": "A Tumor Suppressor Complex with GAP Activity for the Rag GTPases That Signal Amino Acid Sufficiency to mTORC1",
    "abstract": "Limiting mTORC1 The mTORC1 protein kinase complex has important functions linking metabolism to cell growth and its functions are disrupted in common diseases, including cancer and diabetes. Bar-Peled et al. (p. 1100; see the Perspective by Shaw) discovered regulatory components that help turn down signaling by mTORC1 when cells are deprived of amino acids. Two complexes of proteins, GATOR1 and GATOR2, have opposite effects on activity and cellular localization of mTORC1. Components of the GATOR1 complex negatively regulate mTORC1 and appear to function as tumor supressors. Cancers with loss of GATOR1 function may be particularly amenable to therapeutic strategies that limit activity of mTORC1. A protein complex identified as a negative regulator of the mTORC1 protein kinase complex has tumor suppressor functions. [Also see Perspective by Shaw] The mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) pathway promotes cell growth in response to many cues, including amino acids, which act through the Rag guanosine triphosphatases (GTPases) to promote mTORC1 translocation to the lysosomal surface, its site of activation. Although progress has been made in identifying positive regulators of the Rags, it is unknown if negative factors also exist. Here, we identify GATOR as a complex that interacts with the Rags and is composed of two subcomplexes we call GATOR1 and -2. Inhibition of GATOR1 subunits (DEPDC5, Nprl2, and Nprl3) makes mTORC1 signaling resistant to amino acid deprivation. In contrast, inhibition of GATOR2 subunits (Mios, WDR24, WDR59, Seh1L, and Sec13) suppresses mTORC1 signaling, and epistasis analysis shows that GATOR2 negatively regulates DEPDC5. GATOR1 has GTPase-activating protein (GAP) activity for RagA and RagB, and its components are mutated in human cancer. In cancer cells with inactivating mutations in GATOR1, mTORC1 is hyperactive and insensitive to amino acid starvation, and such cells are hypersensitive to rapamycin, an mTORC1 inhibitor. Thus, we identify a key negative regulator of the Rag GTPases and reveal that, like other mTORC1 regulators, Rag function can be deregulated in cancer.",

    "title": "Coordination of the leucine-sensing Rag GTPase cycle by leucyl-tRNA synthetase in the mTORC1 signaling pathway",
    "abstract": "Significance LRS, an enzyme involved in protein synthesis, and Sestrin2, a stress-induced metabolic protein, are suggested to function as leucine sensors for the mTORC1 pathway, a central regulator of cell metabolism, growth, proliferation, and survival. The Rag GTPase cycle regulates mTORC1; however, regulators of the Rag GTPase cycle and their coordination remain unknown. We show the dynamics of the RagD–RagB GTPase cycle during leucine signaling and describe contrasting yet complementary roles for LRS and Sestrin2 in the Rag GTPase–mTORC1 pathway, functioning as “ON” and “OFF” switches, respectively. Our results extend the current view of amino acid sensing by mTORC1 and will be invaluable for the development of novel approaches to combat mTORC1-related human diseases such as cancer. A protein synthesis enzyme, leucyl-tRNA synthetase (LRS), serves as a leucine sensor for the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1), which is a central effector for protein synthesis, metabolism, autophagy, and cell growth. However, its significance in mTORC1 signaling and cancer growth and its functional relationship with other suggested leucine signal mediators are not well-understood. Here we show the kinetics of the Rag GTPase cycle during leucine signaling and that LRS serves as an initiating “ON” switch via GTP hydrolysis of RagD that drives the entire Rag GTPase cycle, whereas Sestrin2 functions as an “OFF” switch by controlling GTP hydrolysis of RagB in the Rag GTPase–mTORC1 axis. The LRS–RagD axis showed a positive correlation with mTORC1 activity in cancer tissues and cells. The GTP–GDP cycle of the RagD–RagB pair, rather than the RagC–RagA pair, is critical for leucine-induced mTORC1 activation. The active RagD–RagB pair can overcome the absence of the RagC–RagA pair, but the opposite is not the case. This work suggests that the GTPase cycle of RagD–RagB coordinated by LRS and Sestrin2 is critical for controlling mTORC1 activation, and thus will extend the current understanding of the amino acid-sensing mechanism.",

    "title": "GATOR1-dependent recruitment of FLCN–FNIP to lysosomes coordinates Rag GTPase heterodimer nucleotide status in response to amino acids",
    "abstract": "Folliculin (FLCN) is a tumor suppressor that coordinates cellular responses to changes in amino acid availability via regulation of the Rag guanosine triphosphatases. FLCN is recruited to lysosomes during amino acid starvation, where it interacts with RagA/B as a heterodimeric complex with FLCN-interacting proteins (FNIPs). The FLCN–FNIP heterodimer also has GTPase-activating protein (GAP) activity toward RagC/D. These properties raised two important questions. First, how is amino acid availability sensed to regulate lysosomal abundance of FLCN? Second, what is the relationship between FLCN lysosome localization, RagA/B interactions, and RagC/D GAP activity? In this study, we show that RagA/B nucleotide status determines the FLCN–FNIP1 recruitment to lysosomes. Starvation-induced FLCN–FNIP lysosome localization requires GAP activity toward Rags 1 (GATOR1), the GAP that converts RagA/B to the guanosine diphosphate (GDP)-bound state. This places FLCN–FNIP recruitment to lysosomes under the control of amino acid sensors that act upstream of GATOR1. By binding to RagA/BGDP and acting on RagC/D, FLCN–FNIP can coordinate nucleotide status between Rag heterodimer subunits in response to changes in amino acid availability.",

    "title": "C9orf72 associates with inactive Rag GTPases and regulates mTORC1‐mediated autophagosomal and lysosomal biogenesis",
    "abstract": "GGGGCC repeat expansion in C9orf72 is the most common genetic cause in both frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), two neurodegenerative disorders in association with aging. Bidirectional repeat expansions in the noncoding region of C9orf72 have been shown to produce dipeptide repeat (DPR) proteins through repeat‐associated non‐ATG (RAN) translation and to reduce the expression level of the C9orf72 gene product, C9orf72 protein. Mechanisms underlying C9orf72‐linked neurodegeneration include expanded RNA repeat gain of function, DPR toxicity, and C9orf72 protein loss of function. In the current study, we focus on the cellular function of C9orf72 protein. We report that C9orf72 can regulate lysosomal biogenesis and autophagy at the transcriptional level. We show that loss of C9orf72 leads to striking accumulation of lysosomes, autophagosomes, and autolysosomes in cells, which is associated with suppressed mTORC1 activity and enhanced nuclear translocation of MiT/TFE family members MITF, TFE3, and TFEB, three master regulators of lysosomal biogenesis and autophagy. We demonstrate that the DENN domain of C9orf72 specifically binds to inactive Rag GTPases, but not active Rag GTPases, thereby affecting the function of Rag/raptor/mTOR complex and mTORC1 activity. Furthermore, active Rag GTPases, but not inactive Rag GTPases or raptor rescued the impaired activity and lysosomal localization of mTORC1 in C9orf72‐deficient cells. Taken together, the present study highlights a key role of C9orf72 in lysosomal and autophagosomal regulation, and demonstrates that Rag GTPases and mTORC1 are involved in C9orf72‐mediated autophagy.",

Recent studies have shown that this phenotypic heterogeneity correlates, albeit imperfectly, with different levels of recombination activity of the mutant RAG proteins. Furthermore, studies in patients and in newly developed animal models carrying hypomorphic RAG mutations have disclosed various mechanisms underlying immune dysregulation in this condition. Careful annotation of clinical outcome and immune reconstitution in RAG‐deficient patients who have received hematopoietic stem cell transplantation has shown that progress has been made in the treatment of this disease, but new approaches remain to be tested to improve stem cell engraftment and durable immune reconstitution. Finally, initial attempts have been made to treat RAG deficiency with gene therapy.",

Neutralizing anti–IFN-α or anti–IFN-ω antibodies were present at detectable levels in patients with CID-G/AI who had a history of severe viral infections. As this autoantibody profile is not observed in a wide range of other primary immunodeficiencies, we hypothesized that recurrent or chronic viral infections may precipitate or aggravate immune dysregulation in RAG-deficient hosts. We repeatedly challenged Rag1 S723C/S723C mice, which serve as a model of leaky SCID, with agonists of the virus-recognizing receptors TLR3/MDA5, TLR7/-8, and TLR9 and found that this treatment elicits autoantibody production. Altogether, our data demonstrate that immune dysregulation is an integral aspect of RAG-associated immunodeficiency and indicate that environmental triggers may modulate the phenotypic expression of autoimmune manifestations. clinical phenotypes. We demonstrate that patients with CID-G/AI in particular produce a broad spectrum of autoantibodies, including neutralizing anti– IFN- α or –IFN- ω antibodies, in association with a previous history of severe viral infections. Chronic engagement of TLR3/MDA5, TLR7/-8, and TLR9 precipitated the production of autoantibodies in a mouse model of LS caused by Rag1 mutations. We propose that viral triggers are important in promoting autoantibody production in patients and mice with partially impaired RAG activity and that anti-cytokine antibodies may serve as a biomarker of an underlying primary immune dysfunction in these patients.",

    "title": "Hierarchical assembly and disassembly of a transcriptionally active RAG locus in CD4+CD8+ thymocytes",
    "abstract": "&NA; Expression of Rag1 and Rag2 is tightly regulated in developing T cells to mediate TCR gene assembly. Here we have investigated the molecular mechanisms governing the assembly and disassembly of a transcriptionally active RAG locus chromatin hub in CD4+CD8+ thymocytes. Rag1 and Rag2 gene expression in CD4+CD8+ thymocytes depends on Rag1 and Rag2 promoter activation by a distant antisilencer element (ASE). We identify GATA3 and E2A as critical regulators of the ASE, and Runx1 and E2A as critical regulators of the Rag1 promoter. We reveal hierarchical assembly of a transcriptionally active chromatin hub containing the ASE and RAG promoters, with Rag2 recruitment and expression dependent on assembly of a functional ASE‐Rag1 framework. Finally, we show that signal‐dependent down‐regulation of RAG gene expression in CD4+CD8+ thymocytes depends on Ikaros and occurs with disassembly of the RAG locus chromatin hub. Our results provide important new insights into the molecular mechanisms that orchestrate RAG gene expression in developing T cells. &NA; Naik et al. show that GATA3, Runx1, and E2A are essential for hierarchical assembly of a transcriptionally active RAG locus chromatin hub in CD4+CD8+ thymocytes. Signal‐dependent down‐regulation of RAG expression is associated with hub disassembly and depends on Ikaros.",

    "title": "Characterization of T and B cell repertoire diversity in patients with RAG deficiency",
    "abstract": "Differences in B and T cell repertoires in patients with RAG deficiency associate with clinical severity. Taking SCID genetics to the clinic Mutations that lead to deficiencies in the recombination-activating genes RAG1 and RAG2 result in a spectrum of immunodeficiencies ranging from loss of T and/or B cell repertoire diversity to a complete lack of T and B cells—severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID). Here, Lee et al. perform next-generation B and T cell repertoire sequencing on 12 patients with RAG mutations who have immunodeficiencies of varying severity. They found that the level of repertoire skewing was associated with the severity of disease and that specific repertoire deficiencies were associated with particular phenotypes. These data support a genotype-phenotype connection for primary immunodeficiencies. Recombination-activating genes 1 and 2 (RAG1 and RAG2) play a critical role in T and B cell development by initiating the recombination process that controls the expression of T cell receptor (TCR) and immunoglobulin genes. Mutations in the RAG1 and RAG2 genes in humans cause a broad spectrum of phenotypes, including severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) with lack of T and B cells, Omenn syndrome, leaky SCID, and combined immunodeficiency with granulomas or autoimmunity (CID-G/AI). Using next-generation sequencing, we analyzed the TCR and B cell receptor (BCR) repertoire in 12 patients with RAG mutations presenting with Omenn syndrome (n = 5), leaky SCID (n = 3), or CID-G/AI (n = 4). Restriction of repertoire diversity skewed usage of variable (V), diversity (D), and joining (J) segment genes, and abnormalities of CDR3 length distribution were progressively more prominent in patients with a more severe phenotype. Skewed usage of V, D, and J segment genes was present also within unique sequences, indicating a primary restriction of repertoire. Patients with Omenn syndrome had a high proportion of class-switched immunoglobulin heavy chain transcripts and increased somatic hypermutation rate, suggesting in vivo activation of these B cells. These data provide a framework to better understand the phenotypic heterogeneity of RAG deficiency.",

    "title": "The Architecture of the Rag GTPase Signaling Network",
    "abstract": "The evolutionarily conserved target of rapamycin complex 1 (TORC1) couples an array of intra- and extracellular stimuli to cell growth, proliferation and metabolism, and its deregulation is associated with various human pathologies such as immunodeficiency, epilepsy, and cancer. Among the diverse stimuli impinging on TORC1, amino acids represent essential input signals, but how they control TORC1 has long remained a mystery. The recent discovery of the Rag GTPases, which assemble as heterodimeric complexes on vacuolar/lysosomal membranes, as central elements of an amino acid signaling network upstream of TORC1 in yeast, flies, and mammalian cells represented a breakthrough in this field. Here, we review the architecture of the Rag GTPase signaling network with a special focus on structural aspects of the Rag GTPases and their regulators in yeast and highlight both the evolutionary conservation and divergence of the mechanisms that control Rag GTPases.",

    "title": "RAG-1 and RAG-2, adjacent genes that synergistically activate V(D)J recombination.",
    "abstract": "The vast repertoire of immunoglobulins and T cell receptors is generated, in part, by V(D)J recombination, a series of genomic rearrangements that occur specifically in developing lymphocytes. The recombination activating gene, RAG-1, which is a gene expressed exclusively in maturing lymphoid cells, was previously isolated. RAG-1 inefficiently induced V(D)J recombinase activity when transfected into fibroblasts, but cotransfection with an adjacent gene, RAG-2, has resulted in at least a 1000-fold increase in the frequency of recombination. The 2.1-kilobase RAG-2 complementary DNA encodes a putative protein of 527 amino acids whose sequence is unrelated to that of RAG-1. Like RAG-1, RAG-2 is conserved between species that carry out V(D)J recombination, and its expression pattern correlates precisely with that of V(D)J recombinase activity. In addition to being located just 8 kilobases apart, these convergently transcribed genes are unusual in that most, if not all, of their coding and 3' untranslated sequences are contained in single exons. RAG-1 and RAG-2 might activate the expression of the V(D)J recombinase but, more likely, they directly participate in the recombination reaction.",

    "title": "Genetic dissection of early endosomal recycling highlights a TORC1-independent role for Rag GTPases",
    "abstract": "Endocytosed cell surface membrane proteins rely on various recycling pathways for their return to the plasma membrane1. Although endosome‐to‐plasma membrane recycling is critical for many cellular processes2, much of the required machinery is unknown. We discovered that yeast also has a recycling route to the cell surface that bypasses the Golgi. Using an engineered synthetic reporter that exclusively follows this pathway, we performed a genetic screen to reveal a cohort of novel and conserved regulators of direct endosome to cell surface recycling. One critical component was the Rag GTPases, Gtr1 and Gtr2, which worked downstream of the exchange factor Vam6 and upstream of the Gtr1 effector Ltv1. Although the Rag GTPases are known to activate TORC1 on the vacuole/lysosome3–5, we find the Vam6>Gtr1‐Gtr2>Ltv1 recycling pathway is independent of TORC1, thus establishing a distinct role for these GTPases in early endosome recycling.",

    "abstract": "TOR complex 1 (TORC1) is an evolutionarily conserved protein kinase complex that promotes cellular macromolecular synthesis and suppresses autophagy. Amino-acid-induced activation of mammalian TORC1 is initiated by its recruitment to the RagA/B-RagC/D GTPase heterodimer, which is anchored to lysosomal membranes through the Ragulator complex. We have identified in the model organism Schizosaccharomyces pombe a Ragulator-like complex that tethers the Gtr1-Gtr2 Rag heterodimer to the membranes of vacuoles, the lysosome equivalent in yeasts. Unexpectedly, the Ragulator-Rag complex is not required for the vacuolar targeting of TORC1, but the complex plays a crucial role in attenuating TORC1 activity independently of the Tsc1-Tsc2 complex, a known negative regulator of TORC1 signaling. The GATOR1 complex, which functions as Gtr1 GAP, is essential for the TORC1 attenuation by the Ragulator-Rag complex, suggesting that Gtr1GDP-Gtr2 on vacuolar membranes moderates TORC1 signaling for optimal cellular response to nutrients.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT The target of rapamycin complex 1 (TORC1) plays a central role in controlling eukaryotic cell growth by fine-tuning anabolic and catabolic processes to the nutritional status of organisms and individual cells. Amino acids represent essential and primordial signals that modulate TORC1 activity through the conserved Rag family GTPases. These assemble, as part of larger lysosomal/vacuolar membrane-associated complexes, into heterodimeric sub-complexes, which typically comprise two paralogous Rag GTPases of opposite GTP-/GDP-loading status. The TORC1-stimulating/inhibiting states of these heterodimers are controlled by various guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) and GTPase-activating protein (GAP) complexes, which are remarkably conserved in various eukaryotic model systems. Among the latter, the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae has been instrumental for the elucidation of basic aspects of Rag GTPase regulation and function. Here, we discuss the current state of the respective research, focusing on the major unsolved issues regarding the architecture, regulation, and function of the Rag GTPase containing complexes in yeast. Decoding these mysteries will undoubtedly further shape our understanding of the conserved and divergent principles of nutrient signaling in eukaryotes.",

    "title": "What makes a RAG regeneration associated?",
    "abstract": "Regenerative failure remains a significant barrier for functional recovery after central nervous system (CNS) injury. As such, understanding the physiological processes that regulate axon regeneration is a central focus of regenerative medicine. Studying the gene transcription responses to axon injury of regeneration competent neurons, such as those of the peripheral nervous system (PNS), has provided insight into the genes associated with regeneration. Though several individual “regeneration-associated genes” (RAGs) have been identified from these studies, the response to injury likely regulates the expression of functionally coordinated and complementary gene groups. For instance, successful regeneration would require the induction of genes that drive the intrinsic growth capacity of neurons, while simultaneously downregulating the genes that convey environmental inhibitory cues. Thus, this view emphasizes the transcriptional regulation of gene “programs” that contribute to the overall goal of axonal regeneration. Here, we review the known RAGs, focusing on how their transcriptional regulation can reveal the underlying gene programs that drive a regenerative phenotype. Finally, we will discuss paradigms under which we can determine whether these genes are injury-associated, or indeed necessary for regeneration.",

    "title": "RAG-3D: a search tool for RNA 3D substructures",
    "abstract": "To address many challenges in RNA structure/function prediction, the characterization of RNA's modular architectural units is required. Using the RNA-As-Graphs (RAG) database, we have previously explored the existence of secondary structure (2D) submotifs within larger RNA structures. Here we present RAG-3D—a dataset of RNA tertiary (3D) structures and substructures plus a web-based search tool—designed to exploit graph representations of RNAs for the goal of searching for similar 3D structural fragments. The objects in RAG-3D consist of 3D structures translated into 3D graphs, cataloged based on the connectivity between their secondary structure elements. Each graph is additionally described in terms of its subgraph building blocks. The RAG-3D search tool then compares a query RNA 3D structure to those in the database to obtain structurally similar structures and substructures. This comparison reveals conserved 3D RNA features and thus may suggest functional connections. Though RNA search programs based on similarity in sequence, 2D, and/or 3D structural elements are available, our graph-based search tool may be advantageous for illuminating similarities that are not obvious; using motifs rather than sequence space also reduces search times considerably. Ultimately, such substructuring could be useful for RNA 3D structure prediction, structure/function inference and inverse folding.",

    "abstract": "Immune deficiencies are often associated with a number of physical manifestations including loss of sense of smell and an increased level of anxiety. We have previously shown that T and B cell-deficient recombinase activating gene (RAG-1)−∕− knockout mice have an increased level of anxiety-like behavior and altered gene expression involved in olfaction. In this study, we expanded these findings by testing the structure and functional development of the olfactory system in RAG-1−∕− mice. Our results show that these mice have a reduced engagement in different types of odors and this phenotype is associated with disorganized architecture of glomerular tissue and atrophy of the main olfactory epithelium. Most intriguingly this defect manifests specifically in adult age and is not due to impairment in the patterning of the olfactory neuron staining at the embryo stage. Together these findings provide a formerly unreported biological evidence for an altered function of the olfactory system in RAG-1−∕− mice.",

    "title": "The Endosymbiont Arsenophonus Provides a General Benefit to Soybean Aphid (Hemiptera: Aphididae) Regardless of Host Plant Resistance (Rag)",
    "abstract": "ABSTRACT \n Soybean aphid, Aphis glycines Matsumura (Hemiptera: Aphididae), invokes substantial chemical treatment and economic cost in North America. Resistant soybean genotypes hold promise as a low-impact control methodology, but soybean aphid “biotypes” capable of development on resistant soy cast doubt on the durability of soy resistance. We hypothesized that variation in soybean aphid ability to colonize resistant soy is partially attributable to a bacterial symbiont of soybean aphid, Arsenophonus. We used microinjection to manipulate Arsenophonus infection in both virulent and avirulent aphid biotypes, resulting in five pairs of infected versus uninfected isolines. These isolines were subjected to various population growth rate assays on resistant Rag versus susceptible soybean. We found that aphid virulence on Rag soybean was not dependent on Arsenophonus: virulent aphid biotypes performed well on Rag soybean, and avirulent aphid biotypes performed poorly on Rag soybean, regardless of whether Arsenophonus was present or not. However, we did find that Arsenophonus-infected clones on average performed significantly better than their paired uninfected isolines. This pattern was not consistently evident on every date for every clone, either in the population assays nor when we compared lifetime fecundity of individual aphids in a separate experiment. Nevertheless, this overall benefit for infected aphids may be sufficient to explain the high frequency of Arsenophonus infection in soybean aphids.",

    "title": "Single-molecule analysis of RAG-mediated V(D)J DNA cleavage",
    "abstract": "Significance V(D)J recombination is essential for assembling immunoglobulin and T-cell receptor genes. The lymphoid-specific RAG recombinase proteins (RAG1 and RAG2) perform DNA cleavage at recombination signal sequences (RSSs) during V(D)J recombination. Although RAG-mediated DNA cleavage has been analyzed in bulk, it has not at the single-molecule level. We used singly tethered DNA particle motion to examine the process in real time. We have found that RAG–RSS binding is reversible, with measurable dwell times before release. We also directly observed a reversible synaptic complex before RAG-mediated hairpin formation and measured its dwell time. These biochemical findings are compatible with a model for V(D)J recombination in vivo, in which the RAG recombinase often samples multiple partner RSSs before initiating the V(D)J recombination reaction. The recombination-activating gene products, RAG1 and RAG2, initiate V(D)J recombination during lymphocyte development by cleaving DNA adjacent to conserved recombination signal sequences (RSSs). The reaction involves DNA binding, synapsis, and cleavage at two RSSs located on the same DNA molecule and results in the assembly of antigen receptor genes. We have developed single-molecule assays to examine RSS binding by RAG1/2 and their cofactor high-mobility group-box protein 1 (HMGB1) as they proceed through the steps of this reaction. These assays allowed us to observe in real time the individual molecular events of RAG-mediated cleavage. As a result, we are able to measure the binding statistics (dwell times) and binding energies of the initial RAG binding events and characterize synapse formation at the single-molecule level, yielding insights into the distribution of dwell times in the paired complex and the propensity for cleavage on forming the synapse. Interestingly, we find that the synaptic complex has a mean lifetime of roughly 400 s and that its formation is readily reversible, with only ∼40% of observed synapses resulting in cleavage at consensus RSS binding sites.",

    "abstract": "4 1 3 5 jci.org Volume 125 Number 11 November 2015 Introduction Historically, primary immunodeficiencies (PIDs) were defined by increased susceptibility to infections. However, it is increasingly recognized that immune dysregulation, inflammation, and autoPatients with mutations of the recombination-activating genes (RAG) present with diverse clinical phenotypes, including severe combined immune deficiency (SCID), autoimmunity, and inflammation. However, the incidence and extent of immune dysregulation in RAG-dependent immunodeficiency have not been studied in detail. Here, we have demonstrated that patients with hypomorphic RAG mutations, especially those with delayed-onset combined immune deficiency and granulomatous/ autoimmune manifestations (CID-G/AI), produce a broad spectrum of autoantibodies. Neutralizing anti–IFN-α or anti–IFN-ω antibodies were present at detectable levels in patients with CID-G/AI who had a history of severe viral infections. As this autoantibody profile is not observed in a wide range of other primary immunodeficiencies, we hypothesized that recurrent or chronic viral infections may precipitate or aggravate immune dysregulation in RAG-deficient hosts. We repeatedly challenged Rag1S723C/S723C mice, which serve as a model of leaky SCID, with agonists of the virus-recognizing receptors TLR3/MDA5, TLR7/-8, and TLR9 and found that this treatment elicits autoantibody production. Altogether, our data demonstrate that immune dysregulation is an integral aspect of RAG-associated immunodeficiency and indicate that environmental triggers may modulate the phenotypic expression of autoimmune manifestations.

    "title": "Rag Virulence Among Soybean Aphids (Hemiptera: Aphididae) in Wisconsin",
    "abstract": "ABSTRACT \n Soybean aphid, Aphis glycines Matsumura, a pest of soybean, Glycine max (L.) Merr., and native of Asia, invaded North America sometime before 2000 and rapidly became the most significant insect pest of soybean in the upper Midwest. Plant resistance, a key component of integrated pest management, has received significant attention in the past decade, and several resistance (Rag) genes have been identified. However, the efficacy of Rag (Resistance to Aphis glycines) genes in suppressing aphid abundance has been challenged by the occurrence of soybean aphids capable of overcoming Rag gene-mediated resistance. Although the occurrence of these Rag virulent biotypes poses a serious threat to effective and sustainable management of soybean aphid, little is known about the current abundance of biotypes in North America. The objective of this research was to determine the distribution of Rag virulent soybean aphids in Wisconsin. Soybean aphids were collected from Wisconsin during the summers of 2012 and 2013, and assayed for Rag1, Rag2, and Rag1 + 2 virulence using no-choice tests in a greenhouse. One clone from Monroe County in 2012 reacted like biotype 4, three clones in different counties in 2013 responded like biotype 2, and eight others expressed varying degrees of Rag virulence. Rag virulence in 2013 was observed in aphids from 33% of the sampled sites and was accounted for by just 4.5% of sampled clones, although this is likely a conservative estimate. No-choice test results are discussed in light of current questions on the biology, ecology, and population genetics of soybean aphid.",

    "title": "Nitrogen Source Activates TOR (Target of Rapamycin) Complex 1 via Glutamine and Independently of Gtr/Rag Proteins*",
    "abstract": "Background: Nutrients, in particular the nitrogen source, activate TORC1 signaling in yeast. Results: The nitrogen source stimulates a rapid, transient activation of TORC1. Preferred nitrogen sources result in sustained TORC1 activity and growth via a mechanism dependent on glutamine accumulation and independent of the Gtr/Rag. Conclusion: Nutrients activate yeast TORC1 via two distinct mechanisms. Significance: Gtr/Rag is not the only mechanism to activate TORC1 in response to nutrients. The evolutionary conserved TOR complex 1 (TORC1) activates cell growth in response to nutrients. In yeast, TORC1 responds to the nitrogen source via a poorly understood mechanism. Leucine, and perhaps other amino acids, activates TORC1 via the small GTPases Gtr1 and Gtr2, orthologs of the mammalian Rag GTPases. Here we investigate the activation of TORC1 by the nitrogen source and how this might be related to TORC1 activation by Gtr/Rag. The quality of the nitrogen source, as defined by its ability to promote growth and glutamine accumulation, directly correlates with its ability to activate TORC1 as measured by Sch9 phosphorylation. Preferred nitrogen sources stimulate rapid, sustained Sch9 phosphorylation and glutamine accumulation. Inhibition of glutamine synthesis reduces TORC1 activity and growth. Poor nitrogen sources stimulate rapid but transient Sch9 phosphorylation. A Gtr1 deficiency prevents the transient stimulation of TORC1 but does not affect the sustained TORC1 activity in response to good nitrogen sources. These findings suggest that the nitrogen source must be converted to glutamine, the preferred nitrogen source in yeast, to sustain TORC1 activity. Furthermore, sustained TORC1 activity is independent of Gtr/Rag. Thus, the nitrogen source and Gtr/Rag activate TORC1 via different mechanisms.",

    "title": "Amino Acid Deprivation Inhibits TORC1 Through a GTPase-Activating Protein Complex for the Rag Family GTPase Gtr1",
    "abstract": "A complex that inactivates a GTPase keeps the TORC1 pathway in check in times of amino acid deprivation. Suppressing Activity During Deprivation The target of rapamycin complex 1 (TORC1) in yeast couples nutrient availability to signaling pathways that mediate cell growth and proliferation. Amino acids stimulate the activity of TORC1 through Gtr1 and Gtr2, members of the Rag family of guanosine triphosphatases (GTPases). Panchaud et al. identified a complex containing Iml1, Npr2, and Npr3 that promoted the inactivation of Gtr1, leading to decreased activity of TORC1 when amino acid availability was limited. The human ortholog of Iml1 partially restored TORC1 inhibition in yeast cells lacking Iml1. As with other signaling pathways that restrict TORC1 activity, the human orthologs of Iml1, Npr2, and Npr3 could function as tumor suppressors. The Rag family of guanosine triphosphatases (GTPases) regulates eukaryotic cell growth in response to amino acids by activating the target of rapamycin complex 1 (TORC1). In humans, this pathway is often deregulated in cancer. In yeast, amino acids promote binding of GTP (guanosine 5′-triphosphate) to the Rag family GTPase Gtr1, which, in combination with a GDP (guanosine diphosphate)–bound Gtr2, forms the active, TORC1-stimulating GTPase heterodimer. We identified Iml1, which functioned in a complex with Npr2 and Npr3, as a GAP (GTPase-activating protein) for Gtr1. Upon amino acid deprivation, Iml1 transiently interacted with Gtr1 at the vacuolar membrane to stimulate its intrinsic GTPase activity and consequently decrease the activity of TORC1. Our results delineate a potentially conserved mechanism by which the Iml1, Npr2, and Npr3 orthologous proteins in humans may suppress tumor formation.",

    "abstract": "Phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN)-inactivating mutations and/or deletions are an independent risk factor for relapse of T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) patients treated on Dutch Childhood Oncology Group or German Cooperative Study Group for Childhood Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia protocols. Some monoallelic mutated or PTEN wild-type patients lack PTEN protein, implying that additional PTEN inactivation mechanisms exist. We show that PTEN is inactivated by small deletions affecting a few exons in 8% of pediatric T-ALL patients. These microdeletions were clonal in 3% and subclonal in 5% of patients. Conserved deletion breakpoints are flanked by cryptic recombination signal sequences (cRSSs) and frequently have non-template-derived nucleotides inserted in between breakpoints, pointing to an illegitimate RAG recombination-driven activity. Identified cRSSs drive RAG-dependent recombination in a reporter system as efficiently as bona fide RSSs that flank gene segments of the T-cell receptor locus. Remarkably, equivalent microdeletions were detected in thymocytes of healthy individuals. Microdeletions strongly associate with the TALLMO subtype characterized by TAL1 or LMO2 rearrangements. Primary and secondary xenotransplantation of TAL1-rearranged leukemia allowed development of leukemic subclones with newly acquired PTEN microdeletions. Ongoing RAG activity may therefore actively contribute to the acquisition of preleukemic hits, clonal diversification, and disease progression.",

    "title": "Studies on the Solid Waste Collection by Rag Pickers at Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation , India",
    "abstract": "Waste was an unavoidable by-product of human activities. Economic development, urbanization and improved living standards in cities contribute to increase in the quantity and complexity of generated solid waste. If accumulated, it leads to degradation of urban environment, stresses natural resources and leads to health problems.Solid waste management has become a major environmental issue in India. Waste management, however, remains a major challenge for any society, since all natural processes generate waste. Rag pickers play an important, but usually unrecognised role in the waste management system of Indian cities. They collect garbage in search of recyclable items that can be sold to scrap merchant like paper, plastic, tin...ect. This activity require no skills and is a source of income for a growing number of urban poor people. The present paper intends to present a vulnerability study of the rag pickers of Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) with focus on the socio-economic and occupational health aspects. The paper makes use of a database, parenting to the socio-economic profile of the rag pickers including the working conditions, and their problems and expectations. This information has been developed through literature review, questionnaire survey and open-ended interviews conducted to generate data on rag pickers in GHMC.",

    "title": "V(D)J recombination: RAG proteins, repair factors, and regulation.",
    "abstract": "V(D)J recombination is the specialized DNA rearrangement used by cells of the immune system to assemble immunoglobulin and T-cell receptor genes from the preexisting gene segments. Because there is a large choice of segments to join, this process accounts for much of the diversity of the immune response. Recombination is initiated by the lymphoid-specific RAG1 and RAG2 proteins, which cooperate to make double-strand breaks at specific recognition sequences (recombination signal sequences, RSSs). The neighboring coding DNA is converted to a hairpin during breakage. Broken ends are then processed and joined with the help of several factors also involved in repair of radiation-damaged DNA, including the DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) and the Ku, Artemis, DNA ligase IV, and Xrcc4 proteins, and possibly histone H2AX and the Mre11/Rad50/Nbs1 complex. There may be other factors not yet known. V(D)J recombination is strongly regulated by limiting access to RSS sites within chromatin, so that particular sites are available only in certain cell types and developmental stages. The roles of enhancers, histone acetylation, and chromatin remodeling factors in controlling accessibility are discussed. The RAG proteins are also capable of transposing RSS-ended fragments into new DNA sites. This transposition helps to explain the mechanism of RAG action and supports earlier proposals that V(D)J recombination evolved from an ancient mobile DNA element.",

    "title": "Performance and prospects of Rag genes for management of soybean aphid",
    "abstract": "The soybean aphid, Aphis glycines Matsumura (Hemiptera: Aphididae), is an invasive insect pest of soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr. (Fabaceae)] in North America, and it has led to extensive insecticide use in northern soybean‐growing regions there. Host plant resistance is one potential alternative strategy for managing soybean aphid. Several Rag genes that show antibiosis and antixenosis to soybean aphid have been recently identified in soybean, and field‐testing and commercial release of resistant soybean lines have followed. In this article, we review results of field tests with soybean lines containing Rag genes in North America, then present results from a coordinated regional test across several field sites in the north‐central USA, and finally discuss prospects for use of Rag genes to manage soybean aphids. Field tests conducted independently at multiple sites showed that soybean aphid populations peaked in late summer on lines with Rag1 or Rag2 and reached economically injurious levels on susceptible lines, whereas lines with a pyramid of Rag1 + Rag2 held soybean aphid populations below economic levels. In the regional test, aphid populations were generally suppressed by lines containing one of the Rag genes. Aphids reached putative economic levels on Rag1 lines for some site years, but yield loss was moderated, indicating that Rag1 may confer tolerance to soybean aphid in addition to antibiosis and antixenosis. Moreover, no yield penalty has been found for lines with Rag1, Rag2, or pyramids. Results suggest that use of aphid‐resistant soybean lines with Rag genes may be viable for managing soybean aphids. However, virulent biotypes of soybean aphid were identified before release of aphid‐resistant soybean, and thus a strategy for optimal deployment of aphid‐resistant soybean is needed to ensure sustainability of this technology.",

    "title": "Geomorphological and geoforensic interpretation of maps, aerial imagery, conditions of diggability and the colour-coded RAG prioritization system in searches for criminal burials",
    "abstract": "Abstract The objective of this paper is to draw attention to the use of air photographs, diggability surveys and the RAG (Red–Amber–Green) prioritization system during police ground searches for burials. The acquisition, analysis and interpretation of aerial imagery by a geologist may provide a useful reconnaissance technique to help delineate and prioritize search areas. A diggability survey may provide information on the ease and efficiency with which the ground may be dug and reinstated by an offender. This is influenced by the depth of the soils, the geology, groundwater, obstructions, the digging implements used, the ability of the offender, the nature of item being buried and the time frames involved. The results of a diggability survey may conveniently be presented as a RAG, map which can help in prioritizing the search. The RAG system appears to have been used independently by geologists, police/law enforcement and the military, and has evolved differently and independently since the early part of the 1900s. These methods have been applied to law enforcement searches for graves and other buried objects as demonstrated by operational case examples.",

    "title": "Amino Acids Activate Mammalian Target of Rapamycin (mTOR) Complex 1 without Changing Rag GTPase Guanyl Nucleotide Charging",
    "abstract": "Background: Signaling by mTOR complex 1 requires its amino acid-stimulated binding to Rag GTPase heterodimers. Results: mTOR complex 1-Rag binding in vitro is independent of Rag guanyl nucleotide charging, and withdrawal of amino acids from cells does not alter Rag GTP charging. Conclusion: Amino acids promote Rag binding to mTOR complex 1 without changing Rag GTP charging. Significance: Amino acids promote Rag-mTORC1 binding by undefined mechanisms. Activation of mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) by amino acids is mediated in part by the Rag GTPases, which bind the raptor subunit of mTORC1 in an amino acid-stimulated manner and promote mTORC1 interaction with Rheb-GTP, the immediate activator. Here we examine whether the ability of amino acids to regulate mTORC1 binding to Rag and mTORC1 activation is due to the regulation of Rag guanyl nucleotide charging. Rag heterodimers in vitro exhibit a very rapid, spontaneous exchange of guanyl nucleotides and an inability to hydrolyze GTP. Mutation of the Rag P-loop corresponding to RasSer-17 abolishes guanyl nucleotide binding. Such a mutation in RagA or RagB inhibits, whereas in RagC or RagD it enhances, Rag heterodimer binding to mTORC1. The binding of wild-type and mutant Rag heterodimers to mTORC1 in vitro parallels that seen with transient expression, but binding to mTORC1 in vitro is entirely independent of Rag guanyl nucleotide charging. HeLa cells stably overexpressing wild-type or P-loop mutant RagC exhibit unaltered amino acid regulation of mTORC1. Despite amino acid-independent raptor binding to Rag, mTORC1 is inhibited by amino acid withdrawal as in parental cells. Rag heterodimers extracted from 32P-labeled whole cells, or just from the pool associated with the lysosomal membrane, exhibit constitutive [32P]GTP charging that is unaltered by amino acid withdrawal. Thus, amino acids promote mTORC1 activation without altering Rag GTP charging. Raptor binding to Rag, although necessary, is not sufficient for mTORC1 activation. Additional amino acid-dependent steps couple Rag-mTORC1 to Rheb-GTP.",

Four rag locus variants are different in pathogenicity of Porphyromonas gingivalis. Moreover, there are different racial and geographic differences in distribution of rag locus genotypes. In this study, we assessed the prevalence of Porphyromonas gingivalis and rag locus genotypes in 102 gingival crevicular fluid samples from 57 cases of gingivitis patients with orthodontic appliances, 25 cases of periodontitis patients and 20 cases of periodontally healthy people through a 16S rRNA-based PCR and a multiplex PCR. The correlations between Porphyromona.gingivalis/rag locus and clinical indices were analyzed. The prevalence of Porphyromonas gingivalis and rag locus genes in periodontitis group was the highest among three groups and higher in orthodontic gingivitis than healthy people (p<0.01). An obviously positive correlation was observed between the prevalence of Porphyromonas gingivalis/rag locus and gingival index. rag-3 and rag-4 were the predominant genotypes in the patients of orthodontic gingivitis and mild-to-moderate periodontitis in Shandong. Porphyromonas.gingivalis carrying rag-1 has the strong virulence and could be associated with severe periodontitis.",

This process is executed by the V(D)J recombination reaction, which can be divided into DNA cleavage and DNA joining steps. The former is carried out by a lymphocyte-specific RAG endonuclease, which mediates DNA cleavage at two recombining gene segments and their flanking RAG recognition sequences. RAG cleavage generates four broken DNA ends that are repaired by nonhomologous end joining forming coding and signal joints. On rare occasions, these DNA ends may join aberrantly forming chromosomal lesions such as translocations, deletions and inversions that have the potential to cause cellular transformation and lymphoid tumors. We discuss the activation of DNA damage responses by RAG-induced DSBs focusing on the component pathways that promote their normal repair and guard against their aberrant resolution. Moreover, we discuss how this DNA damage response impacts processes important for lymphocyte development.",

    "title": "Ebf1 and c-Myb Repress Rag Transcription Downstream of Stat5 during Early B Cell Development",
    "abstract": "The temporal control of RAG (Rag) expression in developing lymphocytes prevents DNA breaks during periods of proliferation that could threaten genomic integrity. In developing B cells, the IL-7R and precursor B cell Ag receptor (pre-BCR) synergize to induce proliferation and the repression of Rag at the protein and mRNA levels for a brief period following successful Ig H chain gene rearrangement. Whereas the mechanism of RAG2 protein downregulation is well defined, little is known about the pathways and transcription factors that mediate transcriptional repression of Rag. Using Abelson murine leukemia virus–transformed B cells to model this stage of development, we identified early B cell factor 1 (Ebf1) as a strong repressor of Rag transcription. Short hairpin RNA–mediated knockdown of either Ebf1 or its downstream target c-Myb was sufficient to induce Rag transcription in these highly proliferative cells. Ebf1 and c-Myb antagonize Rag transcription by negatively regulating the binding of Foxo1 to the Rag locus. Ebf1 accomplishes this through both direct negative regulation of Foxo1 expression and direct positive regulation of Gfi1b expression. Ebf1 expression is driven by the IL-7R downstream effector Stat5, providing a link between the negative regulation of Rag transcription by IL-7 and a novel repressive pathway involving Ebf1 and c-Myb.",

    "abstract": "It is nearly 30 years since the Alt lab first put forward the accessibility model, which proposes that cleavage of the various antigen receptor loci is controlled by lineage and stage specific factors that regulate RAG access. Numerous labs have since demonstrated that locus opening is regulated at multiple levels that include sterile transcription, changes in chromatin packaging, and alterations in locus conformation. Here we focus on the interplay between transcription and RAG binding in facilitating targeted cleavage. We discuss the results of recent studies that implicate transcription in regulating nuclear organization and altering the composition of resident nucleosomes to promote regional access to the recombinase machinery. Additionally we include new data that provide insight into the role of the RAG proteins in defining nuclear organization in recombining T cells.",

    "abstract": "In oil sands froth treatment, an undesirable intermediate layer, often accumulates during the separation of water-oil emulsions. The layer referred to as rag layer is a complex mixture of water, oil, solids and interfacially active components. The presence of a rag layer has a detrimental impact on the separation of water and fine solids from diluted bitumen. The current study focuses on characterisation of solids from a rag layer forming stream of a naphthenic froth treatment plant in an attempt to understand the mechanism of rag layer formation. Through detailed characterisation of rag-forming and non-rag-forming solids, the mineralogy of solids and their contamination were shown to be critical to rag layer formation. The iron-based minerals such as siderite and pyrite were found to be enriched within the rag layer. Analysis of surface organic complexes confirms a high level of organic matter associated with these solids through the binding of carboxylic acid group with iron on solids, resulting in a surface hydrophobicity susceptible for rag layer formation.",

    "abstract": "V(D)J recombination proceeds through a series of protein:DNA complexes mediated in part by the RAG1 and RAG2 proteins. These proteins are responsible for sequence-specific DNA recognition and DNA cleavage, and they appear to perform multiple postcleavage roles in the reaction as well. Here we review the interaction of the RAG proteins with DNA, the chemistry of the cleavage reaction, and the higher order complexes in which these events take place. We also discuss postcleavage functions of the RAG proteins, including recent evidence indicating that they initiate the process of coding end processing by nicking hairpin DNA termini. Finally, we discuss the evolutionary and functional implications of the finding that RAG1 and RAG2 constitute a transposase, and we consider RAG protein biochemistry in the context of several bacterial transposition systems. This suggests a model of the RAG protein active site in which two divalent metal ions serve alternating and opposite roles as activators of attacking hydroxyl groups and stabilizers of oxyanion leaving groups.",

    "title": "Proton-Assisted Amino Acid Transporter PAT1 Complexes with Rag GTPases and Activates TORC1 on Late Endosomal and Lysosomal Membranes",
    "abstract": "Mammalian Target of Rapamycin Complex 1 (mTORC1) is activated by growth factor-regulated phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt/Rheb signalling and extracellular amino acids (AAs) to promote growth and proliferation. These AAs induce translocation of mTOR to late endosomes and lysosomes (LELs), subsequent activation via mechanisms involving the presence of intralumenal AAs, and interaction between mTORC1 and a multiprotein assembly containing Rag GTPases and the heterotrimeric Ragulator complex. However, the mechanisms by which AAs control these different aspects of mTORC1 activation are not well understood. We have recently shown that intracellular Proton-assisted Amino acid Transporter 1 (PAT1)/SLC36A1 is an essential mediator of AA-dependent mTORC1 activation. Here we demonstrate in Human Embryonic Kidney (HEK-293) cells that PAT1 is primarily located on LELs, physically interacts with the Rag GTPases and is required for normal AA-dependent mTOR relocalisation. We also use the powerful in vivo genetic methodologies available in Drosophila to investigate the regulation of the PAT1/Rag/Ragulator complex. We show that GFP-tagged PATs reside at both the cell surface and LELs in vivo, mirroring PAT1 distribution in several normal mammalian cell types. Elevated PI3K/Akt/Rheb signalling increases intracellular levels of PATs and synergistically enhances PAT-induced growth via a mechanism requiring endocytosis. In light of the recent identification of the vacuolar H+-ATPase as another Rag-interacting component, we propose a model in which PATs function as part of an AA-sensing engine that drives mTORC1 activation from LEL compartments.",

    "title": "Rag GTPases and AMPK/TSC2/Rheb mediate the differential regulation of mTORC1 signaling in response to alcohol and leucine.",
    "abstract": "Leucine (Leu) and insulin both stimulate muscle protein synthesis, albeit at least in part via separate signaling pathways. While alcohol (EtOH) suppresses insulin-stimulated protein synthesis in cultured myocytes, its ability to disrupt Leu signaling and Rag GTPase activity has not been determined. Likewise, little is known regarding the interaction of EtOH and Leu on the AMPK/TSC2/Rheb pathway. Treatment of myocytes with EtOH (100 mM) decreased protein synthesis, whereas Leu (2 mM) increased synthesis. In combination, EtOH suppressed the anabolic effect of Leu. The effects of EtOH and Leu were associated with coordinate changes in the phosphorylation state of mTOR, raptor, and their downstream targets 4EBP1 and S6K1. As such, EtOH suppressed the ability of Leu to activate these signaling components. The Rag signaling pathway was activated by Leu but suppressed by EtOH, as evidenced by changes in the interaction of Rag proteins with mTOR and raptor. Overexpression of constitutively active (ca)RagA and caRagC increased mTORC1 activity, as determined by increased S6K1 phosphorylation. Furthermore, the caRagA-caRagC heterodimer blocked the inhibitory effect of EtOH. EtOH and Leu produced differential effects on AMPK signaling. EtOH enhanced AMPK activity, resulting in increased TSC2 (S1387) and eEF2 phosphorylation, whereas Leu had the opposite effect. EtOH also decreased the interaction of Rheb with mTOR, and this was prevented by Leu. Collectively, our results indicate that EtOH inhibits the anabolic effects that Leu has on protein synthesis and mTORC1 activity by modulating both Rag GTPase function and AMPK/TSC2/Rheb signaling.",

Although several genetic causes are known for B+ SCID, the etiology of B− SCID has not been defined. Six of 14 B− SCID patients tested were found to carry a mutation of the recombinase activating gene 1 (RAG-1), RAG-2, or both. This mutation resulted in a functional inability to form antigen receptors through genetic recombination and links a defect in one of the site-specific recombination systems to a human disease.",

    "title": "Bidirectional Activity of the NWC Promoter Is Responsible for RAG-2 Transcription in Non-Lymphoid Cells",
    "abstract": "The recombination-activating genes (RAG-1 and RAG-2) encode a V(D)J recombinase responsible for rearrangements of antigen-receptor genes during T and B cell development, and RAG expression is known to correlate strictly with the process of rearrangement. In contrast to RAG-1, the expression of RAG-2 was not previously detected during any other stage of lymphopoiesis or in any other normal tissue. Here we report that the CpG island-associated promoter of the NWC gene (the third evolutionarily conserved gene in the RAG locus), which is located in the second intron of RAG-2, has bidirectional activity and is responsible for the detectable transcription of RAG-2 in some non-lymphoid tissues. We also identify evolutionarily conserved promoter fragments responsible for this bidirectional activity, and show that it is activated by transcription factor ZFP143. The possible implications of our findings are briefly discussed.",

    "title": "Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Knowledge-Intensive NLP Tasks",
    "abstract": "Large pre-trained language models have been shown to store factual knowledge in their parameters, and achieve state-of-the-art results when fine-tuned on downstream NLP tasks. However, their ability to access and precisely manipulate knowledge is still limited, and hence on knowledge-intensive tasks, their performance lags behind task-specific architectures. Additionally, providing provenance for their decisions and updating their world knowledge remain open research problems. Pre-trained models with a differentiable access mechanism to explicit non-parametric memory can overcome this issue, but have so far been only investigated for extractive downstream tasks. We explore a general-purpose fine-tuning recipe for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) -- models which combine pre-trained parametric and non-parametric memory for language generation. We introduce RAG models where the parametric memory is a pre-trained seq2seq model and the non-parametric memory is a dense vector index of Wikipedia, accessed with a pre-trained neural retriever. We compare two RAG formulations, one which conditions on the same retrieved passages across the whole generated sequence, the other can use different passages per token. We fine-tune and evaluate our models on a wide range of knowledge-intensive NLP tasks and set the state-of-the-art on three open domain QA tasks, outperforming parametric seq2seq models and task-specific retrieve-and-extract architectures. For language generation tasks, we find that RAG models generate more specific, diverse and factual language than a state-of-the-art parametric-only seq2seq baseline.",

    "title": "Idiopathic CD4+ T lymphopenia without autoimmunity or granulomatous disease in the slipstream of RAG mutations.",
    "abstract": "A girl presented during childhood with a single course of extensive chickenpox and moderate albeit recurrent pneumonia in the presence of idiopathic CD4+ T lymphocytopenia (ICL). Her clinical condition remained stable over the past 10 years without infections, any granulomatous disease, or autoimmunity. Immunophenotyping demonstrated strongly reduced naive T and B cells with intact proliferative capacity. Antibody reactivity on in vivo immunizations was normal. T-cell receptor-Vβ repertoire was polyclonal with a very low content of T-cell receptor excision circles (TRECs). Kappa-deleting recombination excision circles (KRECs) were also abnormal in the B cells. Both reflect extensive in vivo proliferation. Patient-derived CD34+ hematopoietic stem cells could not repopulate RAG2(-/-)IL2Rγc(-/-) mice, indicating the lymphoid origin of the defect. We identified 2 novel missense mutations in RAG1 (p.Arg474Cys and p.Leu506Phe) resulting in reduced RAG activity. This report gives the first genetic clue for ICL and extends the clinical spectrum of RAG mutations from severe immune defects to an almost normal condition.",

    "title": "Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Large Language Models: A Survey",
    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) showcase impressive capabilities but encounter challenges like hallucination, outdated knowledge, and non-transparent, untraceable reasoning processes. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a promising solution by incorporating knowledge from external databases. This enhances the accuracy and credibility of the generation, particularly for knowledge-intensive tasks, and allows for continuous knowledge updates and integration of domain-specific information. RAG synergistically merges LLMs' intrinsic knowledge with the vast, dynamic repositories of external databases. This comprehensive review paper offers a detailed examination of the progression of RAG paradigms, encompassing the Naive RAG, the Advanced RAG, and the Modular RAG. It meticulously scrutinizes the tripartite foundation of RAG frameworks, which includes the retrieval, the generation and the augmentation techniques. The paper highlights the state-of-the-art technologies embedded in each of these critical components, providing a profound understanding of the advancements in RAG systems. Furthermore, this paper introduces up-to-date evaluation framework and benchmark. At the end, this article delineates the challenges currently faced and points out prospective avenues for research and development.",

    "abstract": "Immunodeficient mice are becoming invaluable tools in human stem cell and tumor research. In this study, we generated Rag-2/Jak3 double-deficient (Rag-2−/−Jak3−/−) mice with a C57/BL6 and Balb/c genetic background and compared the human lymphohematopoietic cell engraftment rate. Human cord blood-derived CD34+ hematopoietic stem cells were successfully engrafted into Balb/c Rag-2−/−Jak3−/− mice; however, the engraftment rate was far lower in C57/BL6 Rag-2−/−Jak3−/− mice. Transplantation of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells resulted in the same tendency. Thus, a Balb/c background offers superior engraftment capacity than a C57/BL6 background and provides an attractive model for human hematopoietic cell engraftment.",

    "title": "Basal divergences in birds and the phylogenetic utility of the nuclear RAG-1 gene.",
    "abstract": "The single-copy RAG-1 gene is found throughout higher vertebrates and consists of a single 3.1-kb exon without intervening introns. A 2.9-kb region of the RAG-1 locus was sequenced for 14 basal taxa of birds plus the crocodylian outgroups Alligator and Gavialis. Phylogenetic analysis of the sequences supported the hypothesis that the deepest evolutionary split in extant birds separates paleognaths from neognaths. A deep division among neognaths separates the chicken- and duck-like birds (\"galloanserines\") from a clade consisting of all other birds (\"plethornithines\"). The relationships of these three basal clades in Aves were supported by high bootstrap (98 to 100%) and large decay index values (above 14). Additionally, the plethornithine clade is characterized by a 15-bp (five-codon) synapomorphic deletion relative to all other birds. RAG-1 evolves slowly, with a number of properties favoring its phylogenetic utility, including rarity of indels, minimal saturation of transition changes at 3rd positions of codons, nearly constant base composition across taxa, and no asymmetry in directional patterns of reconstructed change. However, RAG-1 does not evolve in a clocklike manner, suggesting that this gene cannot easily be used for estimating ages of ancient lineages.",

    "abstract": "We have examined the regulatory role of the individual components of the immunoglobulin antigen receptor in B-cell development by transgenic complementation of Rag-1 deficient (Rag-1-) mice. Complementation with a membrane mu heavy chain (mu HC) gene allows progression of developmentally arrested Rag-1- pro-B-cells to the small pre-B cell stage, whereas the introduction of independently integrated mu HC and kappa light chain (kappa LC) transgenes promotes the appearance of peripheral lymphocytes which, however, remain unresponsive to external stimuli. Complete reconstitution of the B-cell lineage and the emergence of functionally nature Rag-1- peripheral B cells is achieved by the introduction of cointegrated heavy and light chain transgenes encoding an anti-H-2k antibody. This experimental system demonstrates the competence of the mu HC and kappa LC to direct and regulate the sequential stages of B-cell differentiation, defines the time at which negative selection of self-reactive B cells occurs, and shows that elimination of these cells occurs equally well in the absence of Rag-1 as in its presence. These data also support the hypothesis that Rag-1 directly participates in the V(D)J recombination process.",

    "abstract": "Point mutations that trigger ligand-independent proteolysis of the Notch1 ectodomain occur frequently in human T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) but are rare in murine T-ALL, suggesting that other mechanisms account for Notch1 activation in murine tumors. Here we show that most murine T-ALLs harbor Notch1 deletions that fall into 2 types, both leading to ligand-independent Notch1 activation. Type 1 deletions remove exon 1 and the proximal promoter, appear to be RAG-mediated, and are associated with mRNA transcripts that initiate from 3' regions of Notch1. In line with the RAG dependency of these rearrangements, RAG2 binds to the 5' end of Notch1 in normal thymocytes near the deletion breakpoints. Type 2 deletions remove sequences between exon 1 and exons 26 to 28 of Notch1, appear to be RAG-independent, and are associated with transcripts in which exon 1 is spliced out of frame to 3' Notch1 exons. Translation of both types of transcripts initiates at a conserved methionine residue, M1727, which lies within the Notch1 transmembrane domain. Polypeptides initiating at M1727 insert into membranes and are subject to constitutive cleavage by γ-secretase. Thus, like human T-ALL, murine T-ALL is often associated with acquired mutations that cause ligand-independent Notch1 activation.",

    "title": "Calibration choice, rate smoothing, and the pattern of tetrapod diversification according to the long nuclear gene RAG-1.",
    "abstract": "A phylogeny of tetrapods is inferred from nearly complete sequences of the nuclear RAG-1 gene sampled across 88 taxa encompassing all major clades, analyzed via parsimony and Bayesian methods. The phylogeny provides support for Lissamphibia, Theria, Lepidosauria, a turtle-archosaur clade, as well as most traditionally accepted groupings. This tree allows simultaneous molecular clock dating for all tetrapod groups using a set of well-corroborated calibrations. Relaxed clock (PLRS) methods, using the amniote = 315 Mya (million years ago) calibration or a set of consistent calibrations, recovers reasonable divergence dates for most groups. However, the analysis systematically underestimates divergence dates within archosaurs. The bird-crocodile split, robustly documented in the fossil record as being around approximately 245 Mya, is estimated at only approximately 190 Mya, and dates for other divergences within archosaurs are similarly underestimated. Archosaurs, and particulary turtles have slow apparent rates possibly confounding rate modeling, and inclusion of calibrations within archosaurs (despite their high deviances) not only improves divergence estimates within archosaurs, but also across other groups. Notably, the monotreme-therian split ( approximately 210 Mya) matches the fossil record; the squamate radiation ( approximately 190 Mya) is younger than suggested by some recent molecular studies and inconsistent with identification of approximately 220 and approximately 165 Myo (million-year-old) fossils as acrodont iguanians and approximately 95 Myo fossils colubroid snakes; the bird-lizard (reptile) split is considerably older than fossil estimates (< or = 285 Mya); and Sphenodon is a remarkable phylogenetic relic, being the sole survivor of a lineage more than a quarter of a billion years old. Comparison with other molecular clock studies of tetrapod divergences suggests that the common practice of enforcing most calibrations as minima, with a single liberal maximal constraint, will systematically overestimate divergence dates. Similarly, saturation of mitochondrial DNA sequences, and the resultant greater compression of basal branches means that using only external deep calibrations will also lead to inflated age estimates within the focal ingroup.",

    "title": "Manipulation of Behavioral Decline in Caenorhabditis elegans with the Rag GTPase raga-1",
    "abstract": "Normal aging leads to an inexorable decline in motor performance, contributing to medical morbidity and decreased quality of life. While much has been discovered about genetic determinants of lifespan, less is known about modifiers of age-related behavioral decline and whether new gene targets may be found which extend vigorous activity, with or without extending lifespan. Using Caenorhabditis elegans, we have developed a model of declining neuromuscular function and conducted a screen for increased behavioral activity in aged animals. In this model, behavioral function suffers from profound reductions in locomotory frequency, but coordination is strikingly preserved until very old age. By screening for enhancers of locomotion at advanced ages we identified the ras-related Rag GTPase raga-1 as a novel modifier of behavioral aging. raga-1 loss of function mutants showed vigorous swimming late in life. Genetic manipulations revealed that a gain of function raga-1 curtailed behavioral vitality and shortened lifespan, while a dominant negative raga-1 lengthened lifespan. Dietary restriction results indicated that a raga-1 mutant is relatively protected from the life-shortening effects of highly concentrated food, while RNAi experiments suggested that raga-1 acts in the highly conserved target of rapamycin (TOR) pathway in C. elegans. Rag GTPases were recently shown to mediate nutrient-dependent activation of TOR. This is the first demonstration of their dramatic effects on behavior and aging. This work indicates that novel modulators of behavioral function can be identified in screens, with implications for future study of the clinical amelioration of age-related decline.",

    "abstract": "Destructive midline granulomatous disease characterized by necrotizing granulomas of the head and neck is most commonly caused by Wegener granulomatosis, natural killer/T-cell lymphomas, cocaine abuse, or infections. An adolescent patient with myasthenia gravis treated with thymectomy subsequently developed extensive granulomatous destruction of midface structures, palate, nasal septum, airways, and epiglottis. His lymphocyte numbers, total immunoglobulin G level, and T-cell receptor (TCR) repertoire appeared normal. Sequencing of Recombination activating gene-1 (Rag1) showed compound heterozygous Rag1 mutations; a novel deletion with no recombinase activity and a missense mutation resulting in 50% Rag activity. His thymus was dysplastic and, although not depleted of T cells, showed a notable absence of autoimmune regulator (AIRE) and Foxp3(+) regulatory T cells. This distinct Rag-deficient phenotype characterized by immune dysregulation with granulomatous hyperinflammation and autoimmunity, with relatively normal T and B lymphocyte numbers and a diverse TCR repertoire expands the spectrum of presentation in Rag deficiency. This study was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as #NCT00128973.",

RAG-2-/- mice have small numbers of TCR-CD4-CD8-(double negative, DN) thymocytes that express CD3 gamma delta epsilon and zeta proteins intracellularly. Introduction of a TCR beta transgene, but not a TCR alpha transgene, into the RAG-2-/- background restored normal numbers of thymocytes. These cells were CD4+CD8+ (double positive, DP) and expressed small amounts of surface TCR beta chain dimers in association with CD3 gamma delta epsilon but not zeta.

    "title": "Solid waste, its health impairments and role of rag pickers in Tiruchirappalli city, Tamil Nadu, Southern India",
    "abstract": "In India, the significant increase in the generation of municipal solid waste (MSW) during the last few decades is due to the rapid population and economic development. Though the appropriate attempts are made through the 3-‘R’ principles, waste management still needs to be envisaged seriously by everybody for a cleaner and greener environment. Rag-pickers, who contribute to solid waste management to some extent, are the people who rummage through garbage bins to pick out ‘rags’ for their livelihood. These rag-pickers usually collect the materials that have good re-sale value as these materials are mostly recycled or reused. In the present study, the collection and the management of solid waste and the level of microbial pollution generated through air, soil and solid waste were studied. A questionnaire survey based on age, sex, educational status, socio-economic status, habits and health effects was conducted from 65 randomly selected rag-pickers from various places of Tiruchirappalli city The results revealed that they can be properly educated and trained to protect themselves from unhygienic practices and addiction. Either the Government or non-governmental organizations (NGOs) should devise a suitable proposal to monitor and make use of these unorganized rag-pickers who are indispensable to the society.",

    "title": "Cytosines, but Not Purines, Determine Recombination Activating Gene (RAG)-induced Breaks on Heteroduplex DNA Structures",
    "abstract": "The sequence specificity of the recombination activating gene (RAG) complex during V(D)J recombination has been well studied. RAGs can also act as structure-specific nuclease; however, little is known about the mechanism of its action. Here, we show that in addition to DNA structure, sequence dictates the pattern and efficiency of RAG cleavage on altered DNA structures. Cytosine nucleotides are preferentially nicked by RAGs when present at single-stranded regions of heteroduplex DNA. Although unpaired thymine nucleotides are also nicked, the efficiency is many fold weaker. Induction of single- or double-strand breaks by RAGs depends on the position of cytosines and whether it is present on one or both of the strands. Interestingly, RAGs are unable to induce breaks when adenine or guanine nucleotides are present at single-strand regions. The nucleotide present immediately next to the bubble sequence could also affect RAG cleavage. Hence, we propose “C(d)C(S)C(S)” (d, double-stranded; s, single-stranded) as a consensus sequence for RAG-induced breaks at single-/double-strand DNA transitions. Such a consensus sequence motif is useful for explaining RAG cleavage on other types of DNA structures described in the literature. Therefore, the mechanism of RAG cleavage described here could explain facets of chromosomal rearrangements specific to lymphoid tissues leading to genomic instability.",

    "title": "V(D)J recombination defects in lymphocytes due to RAG mutations: severe immunodeficiency with a spectrum of clinical presentations.",
    "abstract": "Severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) comprises a heterogeneous group of primary immunodeficiencies, a proportion of which are due to mutations in either of the 2 recombination activating genes (RAG)-1 and -2, which mediate the process of V(D)J recombination leading to the assembly of antigen receptor genes. It is reported here that the clinical and immunologic phenotypes of patients bearing mutations in RAGs are more diverse than previously thought and that this variability is related, in part, to the specific type of RAG mutation. By analyzing 44 such patients from 41 families, the following conclusions were reached: (1) null mutations on both alleles lead to the T-B-SCID phenotype; (2) patients manifesting classic Omenn syndrome (OS) have missense mutations on at least one allele and maintain partial V(D)J recombination activity, which accounts for the generation of residual, oligoclonal T-lymphocytes; (3) in a third group of patients, findings were only partially compatible with OS, and these patients, who also carried at least one missense mutation, may be considered to have atypical SCID/OS; (4) patients with engraftment of maternal T cells as a complication of a transplacental transfusion represented a fourth group, and these patients, who often presented with a clinical phenotype mimicking OS, may be observed regardless of the type of RAG gene mutation. Analysis of the RAG genes by direct sequencing is an effective way to provide accurate diagnosis of RAG-deficient as opposed to RAG-independent V(D)J recombination defects, a distinction that cannot be made based on clinical and immunologic phenotype alone.",

    "title": "RAG-2-deficient blastocyst complementation: an assay of gene function in lymphocyte development.",
    "abstract": "We describe a system to evaluate the function of lymphocyte-specific and generally expressed genes in the differentiation and/or function of lymphocytes. RAG-2 (recombination-activating gene 2)-deficient mice have no mature B and T lymphocytes due to the inability to initiate VDJ recombination. Blastocysts from RAG-2-deficient mice generate animals with no mature B and T cells following implantation into foster mothers. However, injection of normal ES cells into RAG-2-deficient blastocysts leads to the generation of somatic chimeras with mature B and T cells all of which derive from the injected ES cells (referred to as RAG-2-deficient blastocyst complementation). Complementation of RAG-2-deficient blastocysts with mutant ES cells heterozygous for a targeted mutation that deletes all immunoglobulin heavy-chain joining (JH) gene segments (JH+/-) also leads to generation of chimeras with normal B and T cells. However, complementation with ES cells homozygous for the JH mutation (JH-/-) generates animals with normal T cells but no B cells, due to a block in B-cell development at a very early stage. Transfection of a functionally assembled mu heavy-chain gene into the JH-/- ES cells prior to blastocyst injection rescues the JH-/- mutation and allows the generation of both mature T and mature B cells. The rescued B cells express IgM but not IgD and respond normally to bacterial lipopolysaccharide stimulation by proliferating and by secreting IgM.",

    "abstract": "The Mre11–Rad50–Nbs1 (MRN) complex functions in the repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) by homologous recombination (HR) at postreplicative stages of the cell cycle. During HR, the MRN complex functions directly in the repair of DNA DSBs and in the initiation of DSB responses through activation of the ataxia telangiectasia-mutated (ATM) serine-threonine kinase. Whether MRN functions in DNA damage responses before DNA replication in G0/G1 phase cells has been less clear. In developing G1-phase lymphocytes, DNA DSBs are generated by the Rag endonuclease and repaired during the assembly of antigen receptor genes by the process of V(D)J recombination. Mice and humans deficient in MRN function exhibit lymphoid phenotypes that are suggestive of defects in V(D)J recombination. We show that during V(D)J recombination, MRN deficiency leads to the aberrant joining of Rag DSBs and to the accumulation of unrepaired coding ends, thus establishing a functional role for MRN in the repair of Rag-mediated DNA DSBs. Moreover, these defects in V(D)J recombination are remarkably similar to those observed in ATM-deficient lymphocytes, suggesting that ATM and MRN function in the same DNA DSB response pathways during lymphocyte antigen receptor gene assembly.",

    "abstract": "For 97 owl taxa from 15 of the larger genera (some monotyplc taxa are not represented) a molecular phylogeny was Inferred from a combined dataset of nucleotide sequences of mitochondrial cytochrome b and nuclear RAG-1 genes. The molecular phylogeny can be used to create a taxonomic framework, which agrees with cladistics. Strigiformes are divided Into two families: Tytonldae and Strigidae. The Tytonldae are subdivided into the subfamilies Tytoninae (with Tyto) and Phodilinae (with Phodilus). The Strigidae cluster in three subfamilies: Striginae, Surniinae and Ninoxinae (with the genera Ninox, and possibly the monotypic Uroglaux and Sceloglaux). The Surniinae are subdivided in three tribes Surnini (with Surnia, Glaucidium and Taenloglaux), Athenini (with Athene) and Aegolini (with Aegolius). The Striginae are subdivided into six tribes: Bubonini (with Bubo including the former Nyctea, Ketupa and Scotopelia), Strigini (with Strix and Jubula), Pulsatrigini (with Pulsatrix and Lophostrix), Megascopini (with Megascops and Psiloscops), Otini (with Otus and Mimizuku) and Asionini (with Asio, Ptilopsis and possibly the monotypic Nesaslo and Pseudoscops).",

    "title": "Asynchronous RAG-1 Expression during B Lymphopoiesis1",
    "abstract": "Changes in cell surface markers and patterns of gene expression are commonly used to construct sequences of events in hematopoiesis. However, the order may not be as rigid as once thought and it is unclear which changes represent the best milestones of differentiation. We developed a fate-mapping model where cells with a history of RAG-1 expression are permanently marked by red fluorescence. This approach is valuable for appreciating lymphoid-lineage relationships without need for irradiation and transplantation. Hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) as well as myeloid and dendritic cell progenitors were unlabeled. Also as expected, most previously identified RAG-1+ early lymphoid progenitors in bone marrow and all lymphoid-affiliated cells were marked. Of particular interest, there was heterogeneity among canonical common lymphoid progenitors (CLP) in bone marrow. Labeled CLP expressed slightly higher levels of IL-7Rα, displayed somewhat less c-Kit, and generated CD19+ lymphocytes faster than the unlabeled CLP. Furthermore, CLP with a history of RAG-1 expression were much less likely to generate dendritic and NK cells. The RAG-1-marked CLP were lineage stable even when exposed to LPS, while unlabeled CLP were redirected to become dendritic cells in response to this TLR4 ligand. These findings indicate that essential events in B lymphopoiesis are not tightly synchronized. Some progenitors with increased probability of becoming lymphocytes express RAG-1 while still part of the lineage marker-negative Sca-1+c-Kithigh (LSK) fraction. Other progenitors first activate this locus after c-Kit levels have diminished and cell surface IL-7 receptors are detectable.",

    "title": "Retrieval-Augmented Generation for AI-Generated Content: A Survey",
    "abstract": "Advancements in model algorithms, the growth of foundational models, and access to high-quality datasets have propelled the evolution of Artificial Intelligence Generated Content (AIGC). Despite its notable successes, AIGC still faces hurdles such as updating knowledge, handling long-tail data, mitigating data leakage, and managing high training and inference costs. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has recently emerged as a paradigm to address such challenges. In particular, RAG introduces the information retrieval process, which enhances the generation process by retrieving relevant objects from available data stores, leading to higher accuracy and better robustness. In this paper, we comprehensively review existing efforts that integrate RAG technique into AIGC scenarios. We first classify RAG foundations according to how the retriever augments the generator, distilling the fundamental abstractions of the augmentation methodologies for various retrievers and generators. This unified perspective encompasses all RAG scenarios, illuminating advancements and pivotal technologies that help with potential future progress. We also summarize additional enhancements methods for RAG, facilitating effective engineering and implementation of RAG systems. Then from another view, we survey on practical applications of RAG across different modalities and tasks, offering valuable references for researchers and practitioners. Furthermore, we introduce the benchmarks for RAG, discuss the limitations of current RAG systems, and suggest potential directions for future research.

All three girls had severe complications after viral infections, including B-cell lymphoma associated with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). Other findings were hypogammaglobulinemia, a diminished number of T and B cells, and sparse thymic tissue on ultrasonography. Molecular analysis revealed that the patients were compound heterozygotes for mutations in recombination activating gene 1 or 2 (RAG1 or RAG2). In each case, both parents were heterozygous carriers of a RAG mutation. The mutations were associated with reduced function of RAG in vitro (3 to 30% of normal activity). The parents and one sibling in the three families were healthy.",

    "title": "Benchmarking Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Medicine",
    "abstract": "While large language models (LLMs) have achieved state-of-the-art performance on a wide range of medical question answering (QA) tasks, they still face challenges with hallucinations and outdated knowledge. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is a promising solution and has been widely adopted. However, a RAG system can involve multiple flexible components, and there is a lack of best practices regarding the optimal RAG setting for various medical purposes. To systematically evaluate such systems, we propose the Medical Information Retrieval-Augmented Generation Evaluation (MIRAGE), a first-of-its-kind benchmark including 7,663 questions from five medical QA datasets. Using MIRAGE, we conducted large-scale experiments with over 1.8 trillion prompt tokens on 41 combinations of different corpora, retrievers, and backbone LLMs through the MedRAG toolkit introduced in this work. Overall, MedRAG improves the accuracy of six different LLMs by up to 18% over chain-of-thought prompting, elevating the performance of GPT-3.5 and Mixtral to GPT-4-level. Our results show that the combination of various medical corpora and retrievers achieves the best performance. In addition, we discovered a log-linear scaling property and the\"lost-in-the-middle\"effects in medical RAG. We believe our comprehensive evaluations can serve as practical guidelines for implementing RAG systems for medicine.",

    "abstract": "Amino acids are key nutrients for protein synthesis and many metabolic processes. There is compelling evidence that amino acids themselves regulate protein synthesis, degradation, and cell growth. Mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) plays a central role in cellular growth regulation. Amino acids potently activate mTORC1, however, the mechanism of amino acid signaling is largely unknown. Recent studies have identified Rag small GTPases as key components mediating amino acid signals to mTORC1 activation.",

    "title": "Aberrantly resolved RAG-mediated DNA breaks in Atm-deficient lymphocytes target chromosomal breakpoints in cis",
    "abstract": "Canonical chromosomal translocations juxtaposing antigen receptor genes and oncogenes are a hallmark of many lymphoid malignancies. These translocations frequently form through the joining of DNA ends from double-strand breaks (DSBs) generated by the recombinase activating gene (RAG)-1 and -2 proteins at lymphocyte antigen receptor loci and breakpoint targets near oncogenes. Our understanding of chromosomal breakpoint target selection comes primarily from the analyses of these lesions, which are selected based on their transforming properties. RAG DSBs are rarely resolved aberrantly in wild-type developing lymphocytes. However, in ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM)-deficient lymphocytes, RAG breaks are frequently joined aberrantly, forming chromosomal lesions such as translocations that predispose (ATM)-deficient mice and humans to the development of lymphoid malignancies. Here, an approach that minimizes selection biases is used to isolate a large cohort of breakpoint targets of aberrantly resolved RAG DSBs in Atm-deficient lymphocytes. Analyses of this cohort revealed that frequently, the breakpoint targets for aberrantly resolved RAG breaks are other DSBs. Moreover, these nonselected lesions exhibit a bias for using breakpoints in cis, forming small chromosomal deletions, rather than breakpoints in trans, forming chromosomal translocations.",

    "title": "Study of Solvent−Bitumen−Water Rag Layers",
    "abstract": "A major operational issue in the crude oil industry is the formation of intermediate rag layers, (primarily water-in-oil emulsions) in oil−water separation processes that limit the amount and quality of recoverable oil. In this study, the formation of rag layers is evaluated as a function of solvent−bitumen−water ratios, solvent aromaticity, and temperature, with various imaging techniques. Using these techniques, it is possible to obtain an estimate of the amount of oil, water, and asphalthenes in the rag layer and excess phases. On the basis of these material balances, it was observed that when bitumen is diluted with a more paraffinic (poor) solvent, such as Heptol 80/20 (80% heptane and 20% toluene), the asphaltenes in solution tend to adsorb/segregate at exposed oil−water interfaces, impacting the extent of rag layer formation. Diluting similar systems with a more aromatic solvent (Heptol 50/50) reduces the surface activity of the asphaltenes, and the stability of rag layers, as evidenced by lower as...",

We report that the Nijmegen breakage syndrome protein (NBS1) and histone γ-H2AX, which associate with irradiation-induced DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs), are also found at sites of V(D)J (variable, diversity, joining) recombination–induced DSBs. In developing thymocytes, NBS1 and γ-H2AX form nuclear foci that colocalize with the T cell receptor α locus in response to recombination activating gene (RAG) protein–mediated V(D)J cleavage. Our results suggest that surveillance of T cell receptor recombination intermediates by NBS1 and γ-H2AX may be important for preventing oncogenic translocations.",

    "abstract": "The contribution of B cells to the pathology of Omenn syndrome and leaky severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) has not been previously investigated. We have studied a mut/mut mouse model of leaky SCID with a homozygous Rag1 S723C mutation that impairs, but does not abrogate, V(D)J recombination activity. In spite of a severe block at the pro–B cell stage and profound B cell lymphopenia, significant serum levels of immunoglobulin (Ig) G, IgM, IgA, and IgE and a high proportion of Ig-secreting cells were detected in mut/mut mice. Antibody responses to trinitrophenyl (TNP)-Ficoll and production of high-affinity antibodies to TNP–keyhole limpet hemocyanin were severely impaired, even after adoptive transfer of wild-type CD4+ T cells. Mut/mut mice produced high amounts of low-affinity self-reactive antibodies and showed significant lymphocytic infiltrates in peripheral tissues. Autoantibody production was associated with impaired receptor editing and increased serum B cell–activating factor (BAFF) concentrations. Autoantibodies and elevated BAFF levels were also identified in patients with Omenn syndrome and leaky SCID as a result of hypomorphic RAG mutations. These data indicate that the stochastic generation of an autoreactive B cell repertoire, which is associated with defects in central and peripheral checkpoints of B cell tolerance, is an important, previously unrecognized, aspect of immunodeficiencies associated with hypomorphic RAG mutations.",

    "title": "Measurement of rapidly available glucose (RAG) in plant foods: a potential in vitro predictor of the glycaemic response",
    "abstract": "Abstract The glycaemic index (GI) is an in vivo measurement based on the glycaemicresponse to carbohydrate-containing foods, and allows foods to be ranked on the basis of the rate of digestion and absorption of the carbohydrates that they contain. GI values are normalizedto a reference amount of available carbohydrate and do not reflect the amounts of carbohydrate normally present in foods; for example, a food with a low content of carbohydrates will have a high GI value if that carbohydrate is digested and absorbed rapidly in the human small intestine. This is potentially confusing for a person wishing to control his or her blood glucoselevels by the choice of foods. The rate and extent of starch digestion in vitro has been measured using a technique that classifies starch into three major fractions: rapidly digestible starch (RDS), slowly digestible starch (SDS) and resistant starch (RS). In addition, thistechnique gives a value for rapidly available glucose (RAG), which includes RDS, free glucose and the glucose moiety of sucrose. When the values for thirty-nine foods were expressed on the basis ofthe available carbohydrate content of these foods, highly significant (P<0·001) positive correlations were observed between GI and both RDS and RAG. The measurement of RAGin vitro provides values for direct calculation of the amount of glucose likely to be rapidly absorbed in the human small intestine and,thus, to influence blood glucose and insulin levels. These values can be used to compare foods, as eaten,on an equal-weight basis. Food-table RAG values would allow simple calculation of the total amount of RAG provided by single foods, by whole meals and by whole diets. Studies are planned in which RAG and the glycaemic response in man will be measured for identical food products.",

    "abstract": "Rag A/Gtr1p are G proteins and are known to be involved in the RCC1-Ran pathway. We employed the two-hybrid method using Rag A as the bait to identify proteins binding to Rag A, and we isolated two novel human G proteins, Rag C and Rag D. Rag C demonstrates homology with Rag D (81.1% identity) and with Gtr2p ofSaccharomyces cerevisiae (46.1% identity), and it belongs to the Rag A subfamily of the Ras family. Rag C and Rag D contain conserved GTP-binding motifs (PM-1, -2, and -3) in their N-terminal regions. Recombinant glutathione S-transferase fusion protein of Rag C efficiently bound to both [3H]GTP and [3H]GDP. Rag A was associated with both Rag C and Rag D in their C-terminal regions where a potential leucine zipper motif and a coiled-coil structure were found. Rag C and D were associated with both the GDP and GTP forms of Rag A. Both Rag C and Rag D changed their subcellular localization, depending on the nucleotide-bound state of Rag A. In a similar way, the disruption of S. cerevisiae GTR1 resulted in a change in the localization of Gtr2p.",

    "abstract": "The first major study of rhythm, metre, and form in North Indian classical music. Time in Indian Music is the first major study of rhythm, metre, and form in North Indian rag , or classical, music. Martin Clayton presents a theoretical model for the organization of time in this repertory, a model which is related explicitly to other spheres of Indian thought and culture as well as to current ideas on musical time in alternative repertories including that of Western music. This theoretical model is elucidated and illustrated with reference to many musical examples drawn from authentic recorded performances. These examples clarify key Indian musicological concepts such as tal (metre), lay (tempo or rhythm), and laykari (rhythmic variation). More generally, the volume addresses the implications of performance practice for the organization of rhythm and metre. Written in a clear and accessible style and illustrated with 102 music examples and diagrams, it will appeal to anyone interested in Indian aesthetic forms and the study of musical time. The book contains a free CD of authentic recorded performances closely referred to in the text.",

The emulsifier was prepared by two procedures: (i) heptane extraction of the cell-free culture medium and (ii) precipitation with ammonium sulfate. A convenient assay was developed for measurement of emulsifier concentrations between 3 and 75 micrograms/ml. The rate of emulsion fromation was proportional to both hydrocarbon and emulsifier concentrations. Above pH 6, activity was dependent upon divalent cations; half-maximum activity was obtained in the presence of 1.5 mM Mg2+. With a ratio of gas oil to emulsifier of 50, stable emulsions were formed with average droplet sizes of less than 1 micron. Emulsifier production was parallel to growth on either hydrocarbon or nonhydrocarbon substrates during the exponential phase; however, production continued after growth ceased.",

    "abstract": "Immunoglobulin and T-cell receptor genes are assembled during lymphocyte development by a novel, highly regulated series of gene rearrangement reactions known as V(D)J recombination. All rearranging loci are flanked by conserved heptamer-nonamer recombination signal sequences. Gene rearrangement results in the imprecise fusion of coding sequences and the precise fusion of signal sequences. DNA molecules with double-stranded breaks near signal sequences have been detected in cells undergoing V(D)J recombination of the TCR delta locus. We have devised a ligation-mediated PCR assay that detects broken-ended molecules in purified genomic DNA. Using this assay we found that DNA breaks occurring precisely at the signal sequence-coding sequence junction are a general feature of V(D)J recombination, appearing in association with each type of rearranging immunoglobulin gene segment. We show that a significant fraction of these broken ends are blunt and 5'-phosphorylated. In addition, detection of these broken-ended signal sequences is dependent on the activity of RAG-1 and RAG-2, and is restricted to the G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle.

    "abstract": "The expression of the V(D)J [variable (diversity) joining elements] recombination activating genes, RAG-1 and RAG-2, has been examined during T cell development in the thymus. In situ hybridization to intact thymus and RNA blot analysis of isolated thymic subpopulations separated on the basis of T cell receptor (TCR) expression demonstrated that both TCR- and TCR+ cortical thymocytes express RAG-1 and RAG-2 messenger RNA's. Within the TCR+ population, RAG expression was observed in immature CD4+CD8+ (double positive) cells, but not in the more mature CD4+CD8- or CD4-CD8+ (single positive) subpopulations. Thus, although cortical thymocytes that bear TCR on their surface continue to express RAG-1 and RAG-2, it appears that the expression of both genes is normally terminated during subsequent thymic maturation. Since thymocyte maturation in vivo is thought to be regulated through the interaction of the TCR complex with self major histocompatibility complex (MHC) antigens, these data suggest that signals transduced by the TCR complex might result in the termination of RAG expression. Consistent with this hypothesis, thymocyte TCR cross-linking in vitro led to rapid termination of RAG-1 and RAG-2 expression, whereas cross-linking of other T cell surface antigens such as CD4, CD8, or HLA class I had no effect.",

    "abstract": "Hypomorphic mutations of the RAG genes in humans are associated with a spectrum of clinical and immunologic presentations that range from T(-) B(-) severe combined immune deficiency (SCID) to Omenn syndrome. In most cases, residual V(D)J recombination activity allows for development of few T-cell clones, which expand in the periphery and infiltrate target organs, resulting in tissue damage. Invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cells play an important immunoregulatory role and have been associated with protection against autoimmunity. We now report on 5 unrelated cases of combined immune deficiency due to hypomorphic RAG mutations, and demonstrate the absence of iNKT cells in all 5 patients. These findings suggest that lack of this important immunoregulatory cell population may contribute to the pathophysiology of Omenn syndrome.",

    "abstract": "During the settling stages in some oil sands froth treatments, a rag layer (an undesirable mixture of dispersed oil, water, and solids) can form at the water−oil interface. To investigate rag layer formation, oil sand froths were diluted with mixtures of toluene and heptane and the diluted froths were centrifuged in steps of increasing rpm. The volumes of oil phase, rag layer, free water, and sediment were measured after each step. The data obtained from the experiments were used for material balances to determine the composition of the rag layers. The size and properties of the rag layer solids were also measured. Two mechanisms were found to influence rag layer formation: slow coalescence of emulsified water between 1500 and 3000 rpm (200−1000 times gravity); trapping of fine intermediate to oil wet solids at higher rpm and residence times. The main process factors affecting rag formation appear to be the type of diluent and asphaltene precipitation. As well, higher quality oil sand produced much smalle...",

    "title": "RAG - Resilience Analysis Grid",
    "abstract": "Introduction A system1 cannot be resilient, but a system can have a potential for resilient performance. A system is said to perform in a manner that is resilient when it sustains required operations under both expected and unexpected conditions by adjusting its functioning prior to, during, or following events (changes, disturbances, and opportunities). Whereas current safety management (Safety-I) focuses on reducing the number of adverse outcomes by preventing adverse events, Resilience Engineering (RE) looks for ways to enhance the ability of systems to succeed under varying conditions (Safety-II). It is therefore necessary to understand what this ability really means, since it clearly is not satisfactory just to call it ‘resilience’. The purpose of the rather roundabout definition given above is to avoid statements such as ‘a system is resilient if ...’, since this narrows resilience to a specific quality. (Or even worse, that ‘a system has resilience if ...’.) RE has from the very beginning maintained that resilience is a characteristic of how a system performs, not a quality that the system as such has or possesses. Resilience is functional and not structural. If we want to use a short description, we should therefore refer to a system’s resilient performance rather than a system’s resilience.",

However, RAG-1 and RAG-2 transcripts were found to be reexpressed in mature mouse B cells after culture with interleukin-4 in association with several different co-stimuli. Reexpression was also detected in draining lymph nodes from immunized mice. RAG-1 and RAG-2 proteins could be detected by immunofluorescence microscopy in the nuclei of B cells cultured in vitro and in the germinal centers of draining lymph nodes.

    "title": "mTORC1 Senses Lysosomal Amino Acids Through an Inside-Out Mechanism That Requires the Vacuolar H+-ATPase",
    "abstract": "Cellular sensing of amino acids occurs at the lysosome and is mediated by the vacuolar proton pump. The mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) protein kinase is a master growth regulator that is stimulated by amino acids. Amino acids activate the Rag guanosine triphosphatases (GTPases), which promote the translocation of mTORC1 to the lysosomal surface, the site of mTORC1 activation. We found that the vacuolar H+–adenosine triphosphatase ATPase (v-ATPase) is necessary for amino acids to activate mTORC1. The v-ATPase engages in extensive amino acid–sensitive interactions with the Ragulator, a scaffolding complex that anchors the Rag GTPases to the lysosome. In a cell-free system, ATP hydrolysis by the v-ATPase was necessary for amino acids to regulate the v-ATPase-Ragulator interaction and promote mTORC1 translocation. Results obtained in vitro and in human cells suggest that amino acid signaling begins within the lysosomal lumen. These results identify the v-ATPase as a component of the mTOR pathway and delineate a lysosome-associated machinery for amino acid sensing.",

    "abstract": "T-acute lymphoblastic leukemias (T-ALLs) derive from human T-lymphoid precursors arrested at various early stages of development. Correlation of phenotype and T-cell receptor (TCR) status with RAG-1 and pT alpha transcription in 114 T-ALLs demonstrated that they largely reflect physiologic T-lymphoid development. Half the TCR alpha beta lineage T-ALLs expressed a pre-TCR, as evidenced by RAG-1, pT alpha, and cTCR beta expression, absence of TCR delta deletion, and a sCD3(-), CD1a(+), CD4/8 double-positive (DP) phenotype, in keeping with a population undergoing beta selection. Most TCR gamma delta T-ALLs were pT alpha, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT), and RAG-1(lo/neg), double-negative/single-positive (DN/SP), and demonstrated only TCR beta DJ rearrangement, whereas 40% were pT alpha, TdT, and RAG-1 positive, DP, and demonstrated TCR beta V(D)J rearrangement, with cTCR beta expression in proportion. As such they may correspond to TCR alpha beta lineage precursors selected by TCR gamma delta expression, to early gamma delta cells recently derived from a pT alpha(+) common alpha beta/gamma delta precursor, or to a lineage-deregulated alpha beta/gamma delta intermediate. Approximately 30% of T-ALLs were sCD3/cTCR beta(-) and corresponded to nonrestricted thymic precursors because they expressed non-T-restricted markers such as CD34, CD13, CD33, and CD56 and were predominantly DN, CD1a, pT alpha, and RAG-1 low/negative, despite immature TCR delta and TCR gamma rearrangements. TCR gene configuration identified progressive T-lymphoid restriction. T-ALLs, therefore, provide homogeneous expansions of minor human lymphoid precursor populations that can aid in the understanding of healthy human T-cell development.",

    "abstract": "Both the programmed death (PD) 1–PD-ligand (PD-L) pathway and regulatory T (T reg) cells are instrumental to the maintenance of peripheral tolerance. We demonstrate that PD-L1 has a pivotal role in regulating induced T reg (iT reg) cell development and sustaining iT reg cell function. PD-L1−/− antigen-presenting cells minimally convert naive CD4 T cells to iT reg cells, showing the essential role of PD-L1 for iT reg cell induction. PD-L1–coated beads induce iT reg cells in vitro, indicating that PD-L1 itself regulates iT reg cell development. Furthermore, PD-L1 enhances and sustains Foxp3 expression and the suppressive function of iT reg cells. The obligatory role for PD-L1 in controlling iT reg cell development and function in vivo is illustrated by a marked reduction in iT reg cell conversion and rapid onset of a fatal inflammatory phenotype in PD-L1−/−PD-L2−/− Rag−/− recipients of naive CD4 T cells. PD-L1 iT reg cell development is mediated through the down-regulation of phospho-Akt, mTOR, S6, and ERK2 and concomitant with the up-regulation of PTEN, all key signaling molecules which are critical for iT reg cell development. Thus, PD-L1 can inhibit T cell responses by promoting both the induction and maintenance of iT reg cells. These studies define a novel mechanism for iT reg cell development and function, as well as a new strategy for controlling T reg cell plasticity.",

    "title": "Mutational Analysis of All Conserved Basic Amino Acids in RAG-1 Reveals Catalytic, Step Arrest, and Joining-Deficient Mutants in the V(D)J Recombinase",
    "abstract": "ABSTRACT Although both RAG-1 and RAG-2 are required for all steps of V(D)J recombination, little is known about the specific contribution of either protein to these steps. RAG-1 contains three acidic active-site amino acids that are thought to coordinate catalytic metal ions. To search for additional catalytic amino acids and to better define the functional anatomy of RAG-1, we mutated all 86 conserved basic amino acids to alanine and evaluated the mutant proteins for DNA binding, nicking, hairpin formation, and joining. We found several amino acids outside of the canonical nonamer-binding domain that are critical for DNA binding, several step arrest mutants with defects in nicking or hairpin formation, and four RAG-1 mutants defective specifically for joining. Analysis of coding joints formed by some of these mutants revealed excessive deletions, frequent use of short sequence homologies, and unusually long palindromic junctional inserts, known as P nucleotides, that result from aberrant hairpin opening. These features characterize junctions found in scid mice, which are deficient for the catalytic subunit of DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PKcs), suggesting that the RAG proteins and DNA-PKcs perform overlapping functions in coding joint formation. Interestingly, the amino acids that are altered in 12 of our mutants are also mutated in human inherited immunodeficiency syndromes. Our analysis of these mutants provides insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying these disorders.",

    "title": "Involvement of a Protein Tyrosine Kinase in Production of the Polymeric Bioemulsifier Emulsan from the Oil-Degrading Strain Acinetobacter lwoffii RAG-1",
    "abstract": "ABSTRACT The genes associated with the biosynthesis of the polymeric bioemulsifier emulsan, produced by the oil-degrading Acinetobacter lwoffii RAG-1 are clustered within a 27-kbp region termed the wee cluster. This report demonstrates the involvement of two genes of the wee cluster of RAG-1, wzb and wzc, in emulsan biosynthesis. The two gene products, Wzc and Wzb were overexpressed and purified. Wzc exhibited ATP-dependent autophosphorylating protein tyrosine kinase activity. Wzb was found to be a protein tyrosine phosphatase capable of dephosphorylating the phosphorylated Wzc. Using the synthetic substrate p-nitrophenyl phosphate (PNPP) Wzb exhibited a Vmax of 12 μmol of PNPP min−1 mg−1 and a Km of 8 mM PNPP at 30°C. The emulsifying activity of mutants lacking either wzb or wzc was 16 and 15% of RAG-1 activity, respectively, suggesting a role for the two enzymes in emulsan production. Phosphorylation of Wzc was found to occur within a cluster of five tyrosine residues at the C terminus. Colonies from a mutant in which these five tyrosine residues were replaced by five phenylalanine residues along with those of a second mutant, which also lacked Wzb, exhibited a highly viscous colony consistency. Emulsan activity of these mutants was 25 and 24% of that of RAG-1, respectively. Neither of these mutants contained cell-associated emulsan. However, they did produce an extracellular high-molecular-mass galactosamine-containing polysaccharide. A model is proposed in which subunit polymerization, translocation and release of emulsan are all associated and coregulated by tyrosine phosphorylation.",

    "abstract": "Recombination activating gene (RAG) expression in peripheral B cells increases after immunization with (4-hydroxy-3-nitrophenyl) acetyl coupled to chicken gamma globulin (NP-CGG) in alum. This increase could result from reinduction of RAG expression or, alternatively, from accumulation of RAG-expressing immature B cells in the periphery. We have used mice that carry a green fluorescent protein (GFP) RAG indicator transgene (RAG2-GFP) to characterize the RAG-expressing B cells in immunized spleens. Most of the RAG2-GFP–expressing B cells in unimmunized spleen are immature B cells. Injection with NP-CGG in alum initially suppresses lymphopoiesis in the bone marrow and decreases the number of immature RAG2-GFP–expressing B cells in the spleen. Recovery of lymphopoiesis in the bone marrow coincides with accumulation of RAG-expressing immature B cells in the spleen. Most of the RAG-expressing cells that accumulate in the spleen after immunization do not proliferate and they are not germinal center cells. Neither the initial suppression of lymphopoiesis nor the subsequent accumulation of RAG-expressing cells in the spleen is antigen dependent, since similar changes are seen with alum alone. Furthermore, such changes in the numbers of developing and circulating immature lymphoid cells are seen after injection with complete Freund's adjuvant or malaria infection. Our experiments suggest that adjuvants and infectious agents cause previously unappreciated alterations in lymphopoiesis resulting in the accumulation of RAG-expressing immature B cells in the spleen.",

    "abstract": "In addition to creating the DNA double strand breaks that initiate V(D)J recombination, the RAG proteins are thought to play a critical role in the joining phase of the reaction. One such role, suggested by in vitro studies, might be to ensure the structural integrity of postcleavage complexes, but the significance of such a function in vivo is unknown. We have identified RAG1 mutants that are proficient in DNA cleavage but defective in their ability to interact with coding ends after cleavage and in the capture of target DNA for transposition. As a result, these mutants exhibit severe defects in hybrid joint formation, hairpin coding end opening, and transposition in vitro, and in V(D)J recombination in vivo. Our results suggest that the RAG proteins have an architectural function in facilitating proper and efficient V(D)J joining, and a protective function in preventing degradation of broken ends prior to joining.",

RAG-1 transcription was found in the thymic cortex of transgenic mice carrying a single TCR alpha- or TCR beta-chain transgene, comparable to normal mice. However, RAG-1 transcription was strikingly reduced in the thymic cortex from transgenic mice carrying both TCR alpha- and beta-chain genes and expressing major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I (H-2b) molecules necessary for positive selection of the transgenic TCR. In contrast, thymi of transgenic mice also carrying both TCR alpha- and beta-chain genes but expressing MHC molecules (H-2d) that did not positively select the transgenic TCR displayed high levels of RAG-1 transcription. The low thymic RAG-1 expression coincided with high transgenic TCR alpha-chain surface expression and with inhibition of endogenous TCR alpha-chain rearrangement. Our findings suggest that binding of the TCR to self MHC molecules during positive selection down-regulates RAG-1 transcription in cortical thymocytes and thereby prevents further TCR alpha-chain rearrangements.",

    "abstract": "The products of the RAG-1 and RAG-2 genes are essential for the recombination of the DNA encoding the antigen receptors of the developing immune system. Little is known of the specific role these genes play. We have explored the sequences encoding mouse RAG-1 by deleting large parts of the gene and by introducing local sequence changes. We find that a RAG-1 gene with 40% of the coding region deleted still retains its recombination function. In addition, a series of small deletions within the strongly conserved remaining 60% of the coding region was tested. Nine out of ten of these prove unable to provide RAG-1 activity, but one is quite active. Certain peptide sequences were also specifically targeted for mutagenesis. The RAG-1 protein generated from this expression system is transported to the nucleus and is degraded with a 15 minute half-life. The fate of the proteins made by the deletion mutants were also assessed. Transport of RAG-1 protein to the nucleus was found even with the most extensive deletions studied. The functionality of the deleted proteins is discussed with relation to an alignment of RAG-1 sequences from five animal species.",

    "title": "Different expression of the recombination activity gene RAG‐1 in various populations of thymocytes, peripheral T cells and gut thymus‐independent intraepithelial lymphocytes suggests two pathways of T cell receptor rearrangement",
    "abstract": "The presence of transcripts of the recombination activating gene RAG‐1 was studied by in situ hybridization on selected populations of murine thymocytes, peripheral lymphocytes and gut intraepithelial lymphocytes (IEL), obtained by cell sorting. RAG‐1 mRNA was found in a majority of “double‐positive” (DP) thymocytes, but was absent in “single‐positive” thymocytes and peripheral T lymphocytes. The only other T lineages in which about 10%–20% of the cells contained RAG‐1 mRNA, and in smaller amounts, were “double‐negative” (DN), T cell receptor (TcR) γδ‐ cortical thymocytes and gut CD3− IEL. These observations suggest that (a) the high expression of RAG‐1 transcripts in DP thymocytes is related to the process of expansion‐selection of these cells, probably accompanied by repeated TcR rearrangements, and that (b) in contrast. CD3− IEL from the gut (which are thymus independent) as well as some DN thymocytes undergo limited TcR rearrangement giving rise locally to TcR+ T cells without prior extensive process of local expansion‐selection. A small percentage of peripheral B cells also contained RAG‐1 mRNA, raising the possibility that this protein may also be involved in immunoglobulin class switching.",

In differentiating precursor B cells from all three strains of mice, the development of similar numbers of CD19+, CD23+, CD40+, and MHC class II+ expressing B lineage cells and similar levels of epsilon H chain gene transcription were induced. Efficient S mu-S epsilon switching occurred in normal and RAG-2-deficient, but not in SCID, precursor B cells. Thus, the transcription of the epsilon H chain is independent of the RAG-2 and the SCID gene product, while the S mu-S epsilon switch recombination requires the SCID gene-encoded DNA-dependent protein kinase, but not the RAG-2 protein.",

    "title": "Regulation of RAG‐1 and CD69 expression in the thymus during positive and negative selection",
    "abstract": "Successful interaction of the T cell receptor (TCR) with major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules during thymic selection down‐regulates the expression of the recombination activating genes (RAG)‐1 and ‐2 in cortical thymocytes and thereby prevents further endogenous TCR α‐chain gene rearrangements (Borgulya, P., Kishi, H., Uematsu, Y. and von Boehmer, H., Cell. 1992. 69: 529‐‐537; Brändle, D., Müller, C., Rülicke, T., Hengartner, H. and Pircher, H., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 1992. 89: 9529‐‐9533). To address the question whether down‐regulation of RAG‐1 activity represents an irreversible process we have blocked TCR‐MHC interactions of thymocytes with thymic stromal cells. Firstly, transgenic (Tg) mice expressing a virus‐specific MHC class I (H‐2Db)‐restricted TCR were injected with anti‐Db or anti‐CD8 monoclonal antibodies and RAG‐1 expression was examined by in situ hybridization on thymus sections. The results show that cortical thymocytes up‐regulated RAG‐1 expression within 24 h after antibody administration. Secondly, immature thymocytes from TCR Tg mice were released from the thymic microenvironment and cultured in vitro for 14 h in single‐cell suspension. The amount of RAG‐1 mRNA was increased sixfold in cultured cells when compared to freshly isolated thymocytes. In addition, we show that immature thymocytes from TCR transgenic mice bearing non‐selective MHC molecules (H‐2d) down‐regulated RAG‐1 expression after antigen‐induced TCR engagement. Cytofluorometric analysis further revealed that surface expression of CD69 on immature thymocytes inversely correlated with RAG‐1 expression during positive and negative selection processes.",

    "title": "A RAG-1/RAG-2 Tetramer Supports 12/23-Regulated Synapsis, Cleavage, and Transposition of V(D)J Recombination Signals",
    "abstract": "ABSTRACT Initiation of V(D)J recombination involves the synapsis and cleavage of a 12/23 pair of recombination signal sequences by RAG-1 and RAG-2. Ubiquitous nonspecific DNA-bending factors of the HMG box family, such as HMG-1, are known to assist in these processes. After cleavage, the RAG proteins remain bound to the cut signal ends and, at least in vitro, support the integration of these ends into unrelated target DNA via a transposition-like mechanism. To investigate whether the protein complex supporting synapsis, cleavage, and transposition of V(D)J recombination signals utilized the same complement of RAG and HMG proteins, I compared the RAG protein stoichiometries and activities of discrete protein-DNA complexes assembled on intact, prenicked, or precleaved recombination signal sequence (RSS) substrates in the absence and presence of HMG-1. In the absence of HMG-1, I found that two discrete RAG-1/RAG-2 complexes are detected by mobility shift assay on all RSS substrates tested. Both contain dimeric RAG-1 and either one or two RAG-2 subunits. The addition of HMG-1 supershifts both complexes without altering the RAG protein stoichiometry. I find that 12/23-regulated recombination signal synapsis and cleavage are only supported in a protein-DNA complex containing HMG-1 and a RAG-1/RAG-2 tetramer. Interestingly, the RAG-1/RAG-2 tetramer also supports transposition, but HMG-1 is dispensable for its activity.",

    "title": "Recombinase-activating gene (RAG) 2-mediated V(D)J recombination is not essential for tumorigenesis in Atm-deficient mice.",
    "abstract": "The majority of Atm-deficient mice die of malignant thymic lymphoma by 4-5 mo of age. Cytogenetic abnormalities in these tumors are consistently identified within the Tcr alpha/delta locus, suggesting that tumorigenesis is secondary to aberrant responses to double-stranded DNA breaks that occur during V(D)J recombination. Since V(D)J recombination is a recombinase-activating gene (RAG)-dependent process, we generated Rag2(-/-)Atm(-/-) mice to assess the requirement for RAG-dependent recombination in thymic lymphomagenesis. In contrast to expectation, the data presented here indicate that development of malignant thymic lymphoma in Atm(-/-) mice is not prevented by loss of RAG-2 and thus is not dependent on V(D)J recombination. Malignant thymic lymphomas in Rag2(-/-)Atm(-/-) mice occurred at a lower frequency and with a longer latency as compared with Atm(-/-) mice. Importantly, cytogenetic analysis of these tumors indicated that multiple chromosomal abnormalities occurred in each tumor, but that none of these involved the Tcr alpha/delta locus. Nonmalignant peripheral T cells from TCR-transgenic Rag2(-/-)Atm(-/-) mice also revealed a substantial increase in translocation frequency, suggesting that these translocations are early events in the process of tumorigenesis. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that the major mechanism of tumorigenesis in Atm(-/-) mice is via chromosomal translocations and other abnormalities that are secondary to aberrant responses to double-stranded DNA breaks. Furthermore, these data suggest that V(D)J recombination is a critical, but not essential, event during which Atm-deficient thymocytes are susceptible to developing chromosome aberrations that predispose to malignant transformation.",

In contrast, deletion of the C-terminal segment of RAG-1, which has homology to a topoisomerase-like protein from yeast, abolished recombination activation.

    "title": "Regulation of RAG‐1 and CD69 expression in the thymus during positive and negative selection",
    "abstract": "Successful interaction of the T cell receptor (TCR) with major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules during thymic selection down‐regulates the expression of the recombination activating genes (RAG)‐1 and ‐2 in cortical thymocytes and thereby prevents further endogenous TCR α‐chain gene rearrangements (Borgulya, P., Kishi, H., Uematsu, Y. and von Boehmer, H., Cell. 1992. 69: 529‐‐537; Brändle, D., Müller, C., Rülicke, T., Hengartner, H. and Pircher, H., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 1992. 89: 9529‐‐9533). To address the question whether down‐regulation of RAG‐1 activity represents an irreversible process we have blocked TCR‐MHC interactions of thymocytes with thymic stromal cells. Firstly, transgenic (Tg) mice expressing a virus‐specific MHC class I (H‐2Db)‐restricted TCR were injected with anti‐Db or anti‐CD8 monoclonal antibodies and RAG‐1 expression was examined by in situ hybridization on thymus sections. The results show that cortical thymocytes up‐regulated RAG‐1 expression within 24 h after antibody administration. Secondly, immature thymocytes from TCR Tg mice were released from the thymic microenvironment and cultured in vitro for 14 h in single‐cell suspension. The amount of RAG‐1 mRNA was increased sixfold in cultured cells when compared to freshly isolated thymocytes. In addition, we show that immature thymocytes from TCR transgenic mice bearing non‐selective MHC molecules (H‐2d) down‐regulated RAG‐1 expression after antigen‐induced TCR engagement. Cytofluorometric analysis further revealed that surface expression of CD69 on immature thymocytes inversely correlated with RAG‐1 expression during positive and negative selection processes.",

    "title": "Expression of zebrafish rag genes during early development identifies the thymus.",
    "abstract": "Recent experiments have demonstrated that zebrafish is a vertebrate in which it is possible to carry out large-scale mutagenic screens to identify genes involved in specific developmental pathways. To follow development of the immune system in zebrafish, we have analyzed the expression of the recombination activating genes, rag1 and rag2, which we have previously isolated and characterized. These genes catalyze the rearrangement of immunoglobulin genes in immature B lymphocytes and of T cell receptor genes in immature T lymphocytes and are therefore appropriate markers to follow the development of organs containing these cells. By whole-mount in situ hybridization, we detected expression of both rag genes in a paired organ in the head, beginning on the fourth day after fertilization. Histological examination of this organ indicated that it corresponds to the thymus, as described for other fish, an organ that has not previously been identified in zebrafish. By histological analysis, the thymus primordium appears at 54 hr but does not enlarge significantly until 30 hr later. The thymus continues to enlarge and reaches its mature histological organization at 1 month. The pronephros, the major hematopoietic organ in the adult fish, begins to develop hematopoietic tissue about 2 weeks after fertilization. By 1 month, mature lymphocytes are distinguishable in the tissue surrounding renal tubules. Lymphocytes appear in the kidney too late for screening by whole-mount in situ hybridization; however, the pattern of rag1 expression in the thymus forms the basis of an assay for mutations affecting development of the thymus or its constituent lymphocytes.",

In differentiating precursor B cells from all three strains of mice, the development of similar numbers of CD19+, CD23+, CD40+, and MHC class II+ expressing B lineage cells and similar levels of epsilon H chain gene transcription were induced. Efficient S mu-S epsilon switching occurred in normal and RAG-2-deficient, but not in SCID, precursor B cells. Thus, the transcription of the epsilon H chain is independent of the RAG-2 and the SCID gene product, while the S mu-S epsilon switch recombination requires the SCID gene-encoded DNA-dependent protein kinase, but not the RAG-2 protein.",

    "title": "Immunization and Infection Change the Number of Recombination Activating Gene (Rag)-Expressing B Cells in the Periphery by Altering Immature Lymphocyte Production",
    "abstract": "Recombination activating gene (RAG) expression in peripheral B cells increases after immunization with (4-hydroxy-3-nitrophenyl) acetyl coupled to chicken gamma globulin (NP-CGG) in alum. This increase could result from reinduction of RAG expression or, alternatively, from accumulation of RAG-expressing immature B cells in the periphery. We have used mice that carry a green fluorescent protein (GFP) RAG indicator transgene (RAG2-GFP) to characterize the RAG-expressing B cells in immunized spleens. Most of the RAG2-GFP–expressing B cells in unimmunized spleen are immature B cells. Injection with NP-CGG in alum initially suppresses lymphopoiesis in the bone marrow and decreases the number of immature RAG2-GFP–expressing B cells in the spleen. Recovery of lymphopoiesis in the bone marrow coincides with accumulation of RAG-expressing immature B cells in the spleen. Most of the RAG-expressing cells that accumulate in the spleen after immunization do not proliferate and they are not germinal center cells. Neither the initial suppression of lymphopoiesis nor the subsequent accumulation of RAG-expressing cells in the spleen is antigen dependent, since similar changes are seen with alum alone. Furthermore, such changes in the numbers of developing and circulating immature lymphoid cells are seen after injection with complete Freund's adjuvant or malaria infection. Our experiments suggest that adjuvants and infectious agents cause previously unappreciated alterations in lymphopoiesis resulting in the accumulation of RAG-expressing immature B cells in the spleen.",

    "abstract": "In addition to creating the DNA double strand breaks that initiate V(D)J recombination, the RAG proteins are thought to play a critical role in the joining phase of the reaction. One such role, suggested by in vitro studies, might be to ensure the structural integrity of postcleavage complexes, but the significance of such a function in vivo is unknown. We have identified RAG1 mutants that are proficient in DNA cleavage but defective in their ability to interact with coding ends after cleavage and in the capture of target DNA for transposition. As a result, these mutants exhibit severe defects in hybrid joint formation, hairpin coding end opening, and transposition in vitro, and in V(D)J recombination in vivo. Our results suggest that the RAG proteins have an architectural function in facilitating proper and efficient V(D)J joining, and a protective function in preventing degradation of broken ends prior to joining.",

    "abstract": "We have examined the expression of the recombination activating gene RAG-1 by in situ hybridization to thymi from mice bearing transgenes for the T-cell receptor (TCR) alpha chain, TCR beta chain, or both TCR alpha and beta chains. RAG-1 transcription was found in the thymic cortex of transgenic mice carrying a single TCR alpha- or TCR beta-chain transgene, comparable to normal mice. However, RAG-1 transcription was strikingly reduced in the thymic cortex from transgenic mice carrying both TCR alpha- and beta-chain genes and expressing major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I (H-2b) molecules necessary for positive selection of the transgenic TCR. In contrast, thymi of transgenic mice also carrying both TCR alpha- and beta-chain genes but expressing MHC molecules (H-2d) that did not positively select the transgenic TCR displayed high levels of RAG-1 transcription. The low thymic RAG-1 expression coincided with high transgenic TCR alpha-chain surface expression and with inhibition of endogenous TCR alpha-chain rearrangement. Our findings suggest that binding of the TCR to self MHC molecules during positive selection down-regulates RAG-1 transcription in cortical thymocytes and thereby prevents further TCR alpha-chain rearrangements.",

    "title": "A RAG-1/RAG-2 Tetramer Supports 12/23-Regulated Synapsis, Cleavage, and Transposition of V(D)J Recombination Signals",
    "abstract": "ABSTRACT Initiation of V(D)J recombination involves the synapsis and cleavage of a 12/23 pair of recombination signal sequences by RAG-1 and RAG-2. Ubiquitous nonspecific DNA-bending factors of the HMG box family, such as HMG-1, are known to assist in these processes. After cleavage, the RAG proteins remain bound to the cut signal ends and, at least in vitro, support the integration of these ends into unrelated target DNA via a transposition-like mechanism. To investigate whether the protein complex supporting synapsis, cleavage, and transposition of V(D)J recombination signals utilized the same complement of RAG and HMG proteins, I compared the RAG protein stoichiometries and activities of discrete protein-DNA complexes assembled on intact, prenicked, or precleaved recombination signal sequence (RSS) substrates in the absence and presence of HMG-1. In the absence of HMG-1, I found that two discrete RAG-1/RAG-2 complexes are detected by mobility shift assay on all RSS substrates tested. Both contain dimeric RAG-1 and either one or two RAG-2 subunits. The addition of HMG-1 supershifts both complexes without altering the RAG protein stoichiometry. I find that 12/23-regulated recombination signal synapsis and cleavage are only supported in a protein-DNA complex containing HMG-1 and a RAG-1/RAG-2 tetramer. Interestingly, the RAG-1/RAG-2 tetramer also supports transposition, but HMG-1 is dispensable for its activity.",

    "title": "RAG-1 interacts with the repeated amino acid motif of the human homologue of the yeast protein SRP1.",
    "abstract": "Genes for immunoglobulins and T-cell receptor are generated by a process known as V(D)J recombination. This process is highly regulated and mediated by the recombination activating proteins RAG-1 and RAG-2. By the use of the two-hybrid protein interaction system, we isolated a human protein that specifically interacts with RAG-1. This protein is the human homologue of the yeast SRP1 (suppressor of a temperature-sensitive RNA polymerase I mutation). The SRP1-1 mutation is an allele-specific dominant suppressor of a temperature-sensitive mutation in the zinc binding domain of the 190-kDa subunit of Saccharomyces cerevisiae RNA polymerase I. The human SRP cDNA clone was used to screen a mouse cDNA library. We obtained a 3.9-kbp cDNA clone encoding the mouse SRP1. The open reading frame of this cDNA encodes a 538-amino acid protein with eight degenerate repeats of 40-45 amino acids each. The mouse and human SRP1 are 98% identical, while the mouse and yeast SRP1 have 48% identity. After cotransfection of the genes encoding RAG-1 and human SRP1 into 293T cells, a stable complex was evident. Deletion analysis indicated that the region of the SRP1 protein interacting with RAG-1 involved four repeats. The domain of RAG-1 that associates with SRP1 mapped N-terminal to the zinc finger domain. Because this region of RAG-1 is not required for recombination and SRP1 appears to be bound to the nuclear envelope, we suggest that this interaction helps to localize RAG-1.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT The genes associated with the biosynthesis of the polymeric bioemulsifier emulsan, produced by the oil-degrading Acinetobacter lwoffii RAG-1 are clustered within a 27-kbp region termed the wee cluster. This report demonstrates the involvement of two genes of the wee cluster of RAG-1, wzb and wzc, in emulsan biosynthesis. The two gene products, Wzc and Wzb were overexpressed and purified. Wzc exhibited ATP-dependent autophosphorylating protein tyrosine kinase activity. Wzb was found to be a protein tyrosine phosphatase capable of dephosphorylating the phosphorylated Wzc. Using the synthetic substrate p-nitrophenyl phosphate (PNPP) Wzb exhibited a Vmax of 12 μmol of PNPP min−1 mg−1 and a Km of 8 mM PNPP at 30°C. The emulsifying activity of mutants lacking either wzb or wzc was 16 and 15% of RAG-1 activity, respectively, suggesting a role for the two enzymes in emulsan production. Phosphorylation of Wzc was found to occur within a cluster of five tyrosine residues at the C terminus. Colonies from a mutant in which these five tyrosine residues were replaced by five phenylalanine residues along with those of a second mutant, which also lacked Wzb, exhibited a highly viscous colony consistency. Emulsan activity of these mutants was 25 and 24% of that of RAG-1, respectively. Neither of these mutants contained cell-associated emulsan. However, they did produce an extracellular high-molecular-mass galactosamine-containing polysaccharide. A model is proposed in which subunit polymerization, translocation and release of emulsan are all associated and coregulated by tyrosine phosphorylation.",

    "title": "Role of adherence in growth of Acinetobacter calcoaceticus RAG-1 on hexadecane",
    "abstract": "The high affinity of Acinetobacter calcoaceticus RAG-1 for liquid hydrocarbons permitted the isolation of a spontaneous nonadherent mutant, MR-481. Strain MR-481 exhibited no significant affinity for three test hydrocarbons, yet resembled the wild type in many properties, including production of the extracellular emulsifying agent emulsan. To study the role of adherence in growth on hydrocarbons, RAG-1 and MR-481 were compared for growth on hexadecane under conditions of limited agitation and at low initial cell densities. Adherent RAG-1 cells were able to grow rapidly under these conditions, whereas nonadherent MR-481 cells failed to grow for at least 54 h. However, the addition of emulsan either initially or at various times after inoculation enabled the nonadherent MR-481 cells to grow on hexadecane. Growth was not the result of reversion of MR-481 from nonadherent to adherent cells. The data demonstrate that adherence is a crucial factor in the growth of A. calcoaceticus RAG-1 on hexadecane in the absence of extracellular emulsification of the substrate.",

    "title": "Mutational Analysis of All Conserved Basic Amino Acids in RAG-1 Reveals Catalytic, Step Arrest, and Joining-Deficient Mutants in the V(D)J Recombinase",
    "abstract": "ABSTRACT Although both RAG-1 and RAG-2 are required for all steps of V(D)J recombination, little is known about the specific contribution of either protein to these steps. RAG-1 contains three acidic active-site amino acids that are thought to coordinate catalytic metal ions. To search for additional catalytic amino acids and to better define the functional anatomy of RAG-1, we mutated all 86 conserved basic amino acids to alanine and evaluated the mutant proteins for DNA binding, nicking, hairpin formation, and joining. We found several amino acids outside of the canonical nonamer-binding domain that are critical for DNA binding, several step arrest mutants with defects in nicking or hairpin formation, and four RAG-1 mutants defective specifically for joining. Analysis of coding joints formed by some of these mutants revealed excessive deletions, frequent use of short sequence homologies, and unusually long palindromic junctional inserts, known as P nucleotides, that result from aberrant hairpin opening. These features characterize junctions found in scid mice, which are deficient for the catalytic subunit of DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PKcs), suggesting that the RAG proteins and DNA-PKcs perform overlapping functions in coding joint formation. Interestingly, the amino acids that are altered in 12 of our mutants are also mutated in human inherited immunodeficiency syndromes. Our analysis of these mutants provides insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying these disorders.",

While no other lymphoid-specific factors are required to induce recombination, other factors with more widespread expression patterns have been implicated in the reaction. However, none of these factors have been cloned, and their relationship to the RAG proteins is unclear. Using the yeast two-hybrid assay, we have identified RCH1, a gene encoding a protein of molecular weight 58,000 that interacts specifically with RAG-1. The predicted Rch1 protein sequence is 47% identical to yeast SRP1, a protein associated with the nuclear envelope. A truncated form of Rch1, which retains the ability to interact with RAG-1, reduces V(D)J recombination activity in HeLa cells.",

    "abstract": "A series of recent studies in humans and the NOD mouse model have highlighted the central role that autoimmunity directed against insulin, in particular the insulin B chain 9-23 peptide, may play in the pathogenesis of type 1 diabetes. Both pathogenic and protective T-cell clones recognizing the B:9-23 peptide have been produced. This report describes the successful creation of BDC12-4.1 T-cell receptor (TCR) transgenic mice with spontaneous insulitis in F1 mice (FVB × NOD) and spontaneous diabetes in NOD.RAG−/− (backcross 1 generation). Disease progression is heterogeneous and is modified by a series of genetic factors including heterozygosity (H-2g7/H-2q) versus homozygosity for H-2g7, the presence of additional T-/B-cell receptor–rearranged genes (RAG+ versus RAG−/−), and the insulin 2 gene knockout (the insulin gene expressed in the NOD thymus). Despite lymphopenia, 40% of H-2g7/g7 BDC12-4.1 TCR+ RAG−/− Ins2−/− mice are diabetic by 10 weeks of age. As few as 13,500 transgenic T-cells from a diabetic TCR+ RAG−/− mouse can transfer diabetes to an NOD.scid mouse. The current study demonstrates that the BDC12-4.1 TCR is sufficient to cause diabetes at NOD backcross 1, bypassing polygenic inhibition of insulitis and diabetogenesis.",

    "abstract": "The recombinase activating genes RAG-1 and RAG-2 operate together to activate V(D)J recombination, and thus play an essential role in the generation of immune system diversity. As a first step in understanding the function of the RAG-2 protein, we have tested a series of deletion and insertion mutations for their ability to induce V(D)J joining of a variety of model substrates. Mutants were assayed for their ability to induce deletional and inversional V(D)J joining, thereby testing their proficiency at forming both signal and coding joints, and, in some cases, for their ability to carry out recombination of both extrachromosomal and integrated recombination substrates. All these reactions were affected similarly by any one mutation. Although the RAG-2 protein shows extensive evolutionary conservation across its length, we found that the carboxy-terminal portion of RAG-2, including an acidic region, is dispensable for all forms of recombination tested. In contrast, all mutations we created in the N-terminal region severely decreased recombination. Thus, the core active region required for V(D)J recombination is confined to the first three-quarters of the RAG-2 protein.",

    "title": "Phylogeny, diversity, and classification of the Accipitridae based on DNA sequences of the RAG-1 exon",
    "abstract": "The avian family Accipitridae has historically been divided into subfamilies or tribes based on features such as general resemblance, feeding ecology, and behavior. Consequently, the monophyly of those groups has been questionable. Recently, three phylogenetic analyses of a majority of the genera have appeared, one based on osteology, one on DNA sequences from a single mitochondrial gene, and the third on mitochondrial plus nuclear DNA sequences, and the resulting phylogenies were in substantial disagreement concerning the composition and basal branching patterns of the clades and hence require further analysis and confirmation. Here we use DNA sequences from the large nuclear RAG-1 exon to investigate the phylogenetic relationships of these birds. Our results largely corroborated the prior study that included nuclear genes. We found strong support for a monophyletic clade comprising the secretarybird Sagittarius serpentarius, the osprey Pandion haliaetus, and the traditional accipitrids. However, every one of the traditionally recognized subfamilies of accipitrids was found to be polyphyletic. The most basal nodes in the phylogeny separate small clades of insectivorous and scavenger species, such as kites and Old World vultures, from the rest of the family. The speciose genera of bird and mammal predators are all relatively derived (terminal) in the phylogeny. Many of the basal clades are cosmopolitan in their distributions, consistent with the great mobility of these raptors. A new classification is proposed that eliminates the problem of polyphyletic intrafamilial taxa.",

The activity and stability of the RAG-2 protein have now been shown to be regulated by phosphorylation. In fibroblasts RAG-2 was phosphorylated predominantly at two serine residues, one of which affected RAG-2 activity in vivo. The threonine at residue 490 was phosphorylated by p34cdc2 kinase in vitro; phosphorylation at this site in vivo was associated with rapid degradation of RAG-2. Instability was transferred to chimeric proteins by a 90-residue portion of RAG-2. Mutation of the p34cdc2 phosphorylation site of the tumor suppressor protein p53 conferred a similar phenotype, suggesting that this association between phosphorylation and degradation is a general mechanism.",

    "abstract": "As a probe of whether RAG-1 and RAG-2 gene products activate other genes or form part of the recombinase itself, certain mutants of the RAG genes were assayed for their ability to activate variable-diversity-joining region [V(D)J] recombination in a plasmid substrate in fibroblasts. The results indicate that the N-terminal one-third of RAG-1, including a zinc-finger-like domain, and an acidic domain of RAG-2 are dispensable for activating V(D)J recombination in a fibroblast, although they contribute quantitatively. In contrast, deletion of the C-terminal segment of RAG-1, which has homology to a topoisomerase-like protein from yeast, abolished recombination activation. These results do not support the hypothesis that the RAG gene products are transcription factors and suggest the possibility that they are parts of the recombination machinery.",

    "title": "RAG-dependent peripheral T cell receptor diversification in CD8+ T lymphocytes",
    "abstract": "Rearrangement of T cell receptor (TCR) genes is driven by transient expression of V(D)J recombination-activating genes (RAGs) during lymphocyte development. Immunological dogma holds that T cells irreversibly terminate RAG expression before exiting the thymus, and that all of the progeny arising from mature T cells express the parental TCRs. When single pancreatic islet-derived, NRP-A7 peptide-reactive CD8+ T cells from nonobese diabetic (NOD) mice were repeatedly stimulated with peptide-pulsed dendritic cells, daughter T cells reexpressed RAGs, lost their ability to bind to NRP-A7/Kd tetramers, ceased to transcribe tetramer-specific TCR genes, and, instead, expressed a vast array of other TCR rearrangements. Pancreatic lymph node (PLN) CD8+ T cells from animals expressing a transgenic NRP-A7-reactive TCR transcribed and translated RAGs in vivo and displayed endogenous TCRs on their surface. RAG reexpression also occurred in the PLN CD8+ T cells of wild-type NOD mice and could be induced in the peripheral CD8+ T cells of nondiabetes-prone TCR-transgenic B10.H2g7 mice by stimulation with peptide-pulsed dendritic cells. In contrast, reexpression of RAGs could not be induced in the CD8+ T cells of B6 mice expressing an ovalbumin-specific, Kb-restricted TCR, or in the CD8+ T cells of NOD mice expressing a lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus-specific, Db-restricted TCR. Extra-thymic reexpression of the V(D)J recombination machinery in certain CD8+ T cell subpopulations, therefore, enables further diversification of the peripheral T cell repertoire.",

    "title": "Fine Structure and Activity of Discrete RAG-HMG Complexes on V(D)J Recombination Signals",
    "abstract": "ABSTRACT Two lymphoid cell-specific proteins, RAG-1 and RAG-2, initiate V(D)J recombination by introducing DNA breaks at recombination signal sequences (RSSs). Although the RAG proteins themselves bind and cleave DNA substrates containing either a 12-RSS or a 23-RSS, DNA-bending proteins HMG-1 and HMG-2 are known to promote these processes, particularly with 23-RSS substrates. Using in-gel cleavage assays and DNA footprinting techniques, I analyzed the catalytic activity and protein-DNA contacts in discrete 12-RSS and 23-RSS complexes containing the RAG proteins and either HMG-1 or HMG-2. I found that both the cleavage activity and the pattern of protein-DNA contacts in RAG-HMG complexes assembled on 12-RSS substrates closely resembled those obtained from analogous 12-RSS complexes lacking HMG protein. In contrast, 23-RSS complexes containing both RAG proteins and either HMG-1 or HMG-2 exhibited enhanced cleavage activity and displayed an altered distribution of cleavage products compared to 23-RSS complexes containing only RAG-1 and RAG-2. Moreover, HMG-dependent heptamer contacts in 23-RSS complexes were observed. The protein-DNA contacts in RAG-RSS-HMG complexes assembled on 12-RSS or 23-RSS substrates were strikingly similar at comparable positions, suggesting that the RAG proteins mediate HMG-dependent heptamer contacts in 23-RSS complexes. Results of ethylation interference experiments suggest that the HMG protein is positioned 5′ of the nonamer in 23-RSS complexes, interacting largely with the side of the duplex opposite the one contacting the RAG proteins. Thus, HMG protein plays the dual role of bringing critical elements of the 23-RSS heptamer into the same phase as the 12-RSS to promote RAG binding and assisting in the catalysis of 23-RSS cleavage.",

    "abstract": "Emulsan is a polymeric extracellular emulsifying agent produced by Acinetobacter RAG‐1. Hydrocarbon‐in‐water emulsions (Vf of hydrocarbon of 0.01–0.10) were stabilized by small quantities of emulsan (0.02–0.2 mg/mL). Although both aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbon emulsions were stabilized by emulsan, mixtures containing both aliphatics and aromatics were better substrates for emulsan than the individual hydrocarbon by themselves. The emulsan remained tightly bound to the hydrocarbon even after centrifugation as determined by (a) residual emulsan in the aqueous phase and (b) the fact that the resulting “cream” readily dispersed in water to reform stable emulsions. With hexadecane‐to‐emulsan weight ratio of 39 and 155, the noncoalescing oil droplets had average droplet diameters of 2.0 and 4.0 μm, respectively. Dialysis studies showed that the water‐soluble dye Rhodamine B adsorbed tightly to the interface of hexadecane–emulsan droplets although the dye did not bind to either hexadecane or emulsan alone. At saturating concentrations of dye, 2.2 μmol of dye were bound per mg emulsan.",

    "title": "Roles of the “Dispensable” Portions of RAG-1 and RAG-2 in V(D)J Recombination",
    "abstract": "ABSTRACT V(D)J recombination is initiated by introduction of site-specific double-stranded DNA breaks by the RAG-1 and RAG-2 proteins. The broken DNA ends are then joined by the cellular double-strand break repair machinery. Previous work has shown that truncated (core) versions of the RAG proteins can catalyze V(D)J recombination, although less efficiently than their full-length counterparts. It is not known whether truncating RAG-1 and/or RAG-2 affects the cleavage step or the joining step of recombination. Here we examine the effects of truncated RAG proteins on recombination intermediates and products. We found that while truncated RAG proteins generate lower levels of recombination products than their full-length counterparts, they consistently generate 10-fold higher levels of one class of recombination intermediates, termed signal ends. Our results suggest that this increase in signal ends does not result from increased cleavage, since levels of the corresponding intermediates, coding ends, are not elevated. Thus, removal of the “dispensable” regions of the RAG proteins impairs proper processing of recombination intermediates. Furthermore, we found that removal of portions of the dispensable regions of RAG-1 and RAG-2 affects the efficiency of product formation without altering the levels of recombination intermediates. Thus, these evolutionarily conserved sequences play multiple, important roles in V(D)J recombination.",

    "title": "Double-Strand Break Formation by the RAG Complex at the Bcl-2 Major Breakpoint Region and at Other Non-B DNA Structures In Vitro",
    "abstract": "ABSTRACT The most common chromosomal translocation in cancer, t(14;18) at the 150-bp bcl-2 major breakpoint region (Mbr), occurs in follicular lymphomas. The bcl-2 Mbr assumes a non-B DNA conformation, thus explaining its distinctive fragility. This non-B DNA structure is a target of the RAG complex in vivo, but not because of its primary sequence. Here we report that the RAG complex generates at least two independent nicks that lead to double-strand breaks in vitro, and this requires the non-B DNA structure at the bcl-2 Mbr. A 3-bp mutation is capable of abolishing the non-B structure formation and the double-strand breaks. The observations on the bcl-2 Mbr reflect more general properties of the RAG complex, which can bind and nick at duplex-single-strand transitions of other non-B DNA structures, resulting in double-strand breaks in vitro. Hence, the present study reveals novel insight into a third mechanism of action of RAGs on DNA, besides the standard heptamer/nonamer-mediated cleavage in V(D)J recombination and the in vitro transposase activity.",

    "title": "The Role of Recombination Activating Gene (RAG) Reinduction in Thymocyte Development in Vivo",
    "abstract": "Assembly of T cell receptor (TCR)α/β genes by variable/diversity/joining (V[D]J) rearrangement is an ordered process beginning with recombination activating gene (RAG) expression and TCRβ recombination in CD4−CD8−CD25+ thymocytes. In these cells, TCRβ expression leads to clonal expansion, RAG downregulation, and TCRβ allelic exclusion. At the subsequent CD4+CD8+ stage, RAG expression is reinduced and V(D)J recombination is initiated at the TCRα locus. This second wave of RAG expression is terminated upon expression of a positively selected α/β TCR. To examine the physiologic role of the second wave of RAG expression, we analyzed mice that cannot reinduce RAG expression in CD4+CD8+ T cells because the transgenic locus that directs RAG1 and RAG2 expression in these mice is missing a distal regulatory element essential for reinduction. In the absence of RAG reinduction we find normal numbers of CD4+CD8+ cells but a 50–70% reduction in the number of mature CD4+CD8− and CD4−CD8+ thymocytes. TCRα rearrangement is restricted to the 5′ end of the Jα cluster and there is little apparent secondary TCRα recombination. Comparison of the TCRα genes expressed in wild-type or mutant mice shows that 65% of all α/β T cells carry receptors that are normally assembled by secondary TCRα rearrangement. We conclude that RAG reinduction in CD4+CD8+ thymocytes is not required for initial TCRα recombination but is essential for secondary TCRα recombination and that the majority of TCRα chains expressed in mature T cells are products of secondary recombination.",

    "abstract": "The protein products of the recombination activating genes (RAG1 and RAG2) initiate the formation of immunoglobulin (Ig) and T-cell receptors, which are essential for B- and T-cell development, respectively. Mutations in the RAG genes result in severe combined immunodeficiency disease (SCID), generally characterized by the absence of mature B and T lymphocytes, but presence of natural killer (NK) cells. Biochemically, mutations in the RAG genes result either in nonfunctional proteins or in proteins with partial recombination activity. The mutated RAG genes of 9 patients from 7 families were analyzed for their recombination activity using extrachromosomal recombination substrates, rearrangement of endogenous Ig loci in RAG gene-transfected nonlymphoid cells, or the presence of Ig gene rearrangements in bone marrow (BM). Recombination activity was virtually absent in all 6 patients with mutations in the RAG core domains, but partial activity was present in the other 3 RAG-deficient patients, 2 of them having Omenn syndrome with oligoclonal T lymphocytes. Using 4-color flow cytometry, we could define the exact stage at which B-cell differentiation was arrested in the BM of 5 RAG-deficient SCID patients. In 4 of 5 patients, the absence of recombination activity was associated with a complete B-cell differentiation arrest at the transition from cytoplasmic (Cy) Igmu(-) pre-B-I cells to CyIgmu(+) pre-B-II cells. However, the fifth patient showed low frequencies of precursor B cells with CyIgmu and surface membrane IgM, in line with the partial recombination activity of the patient's mutated RAG gene and the detection of in-frame Ig gene rearrangements in BM.",

From these data a weight average molecular weight of 9.76 × 105 and a viscosity average molecular weight of 9.88 × 105 were calculated. EF-RAG(UET)WA contained 46.7% C, 7.01% H, and 6.06% N. Titration of the nonreducing polymer gave a single inflection point (pK′ = 3.05), corresponding to 1.5 μmol of carboxyl groups per mg. Direct estimation of O-ester and hexose content of the highly acidic polymer yielded 0.65 and 0.29 μmol/mg, respectively. Mild alkaline hydrolysis released fatty acids with an average molecular weight of about 231. Strong acid hydrolysis of EF-RAG(UET)WA yielded d-glucose (minor), d-galactosamine (major), and an unidentified amino uronic acid (major).",

    "title": "The rag locus of Porphyromonas gingivalis: a novel pathogenicity island.",
    "abstract": "Previous studies in our laboratories of the serum IgG antibody response of periodontal patients have demonstrated the presence of an immunodominant surface antigen (Mr 55 kDa) in the outer membrane of Porphyromonas gingivalis W50. Genetic analysis of this antigen revealed that the corresponding gene forms part of a small operon which may have arisen via horizontal gene transfer into the genome of this strain. On the basis of sequence homology, the 55 kDa antigen (RagB) and the product of a cotranscribed gene (RagA) may act in concert at the surface of the bacterium to facilitate active transport, mediated through the periplasmic spanning protein, TonB, or form part of a signal transduction system in this organism. The rag locus is present in only a proportion of P. gingivalis laboratory strains and clinical isolates. Analysis of the distribution of ragB in subgingival samples by PCR demonstrated that rag+ P. gingivalis are more frequently detected in deep periodontal pockets than shallow sites in periodontal patients. These findings indicate that the rag genes may influence the virulence potential of P. gingivalis strains which harbour this locus and may thus be considered a novel pathogenicity island. Furthermore, horizontal gene transfer between organisms in subgingival plaque may represent a significant force in the evolution of these bacteria with ramifications for both diagnosis and targeted treatment of periodontal disease.",

    "title": "Sequence Diversity and Antigenic Variation at the rag Locus of Porphyromonas gingivalis",
    "abstract": "ABSTRACT The rag locus of Porphyromonas gingivalis W50 encodes RagA, a predicted tonB-dependent receptor protein, and RagB, a lipoprotein that constitutes an immunodominant outer membrane antigen. The low G+C content of the locus, an association with mobility elements, and an apparent restricted distribution in the species suggested that the locus had arisen by horizontal gene transfer. In the present study, we have demonstrated that there are four divergent alleles of the rag locus. The original rag allele found in W50 was renamed rag-1, while three novel alleles, rag-2 to rag-4, were found in isolates lacking rag-1. The three novel alleles encoded variants of RagA with 63 to 71% amino acid identity to RagA1 and each other and variants of RagB with 43 to 56% amino acid identity. The RagA/B proteins have homology to numerous Bacteroides proteins, including SusC/D, implicated in polysaccharide uptake. Monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies raised against RagB1 of P. gingivalis W50 did not cross-react with proteins from isolates carrying different alleles. In a laboratory collection of 168 isolates, 26% carried rag-1, 36% carried rag-2, 25% carried rag-3, and 14% carried rag-4 (including the type strain, ATCC 33277). Restriction profiles of the locus in different isolates demonstrated polymorphism within each allele, some of which is accounted for by the presence or absence of insertion sequence elements. By reference to a previously published study on virulence in a mouse model (M. L. Laine and A. J. van Winkelhoff, Oral Microbiol. Immunol. 13:322-325, 1998), isolates that caused serious disease in mice were significantly more likely to carry rag-1 than other rag alleles.",

    "title": "Full-length RAG-2, and Not Full-length RAG-1, Specifically Suppresses RAG-mediated Transposition but Not Hybrid Joint Formation or Disintegration*",
    "abstract": "RAG-1 and RAG-2 initiate V(D)J recombination by introducing DNA breaks at recombination signal sequences flanking a pair of antigen receptor gene segments. Occasionally, the RAG proteins mediate two other alternative DNA rearrangements in vivo: the rejoining of signal and coding ends and the transposition of signal ends into unrelated DNA. In contrast, truncated, catalytically active “core” RAG proteins readily catalyze these reactions in vitro, suggesting that full-length RAG proteins directly or indirectly suppress these undesired reactions in vivo. To discriminate between direct and indirect suppression models, full-length RAG proteins were purified and characterized in vitro. From mammalian cells, full-length RAG-1 is readily purified with core RAG-2 but not full-length RAG-2 and vice versa. Despite differences in DNA binding activity, recombinase containing either core or full-length RAG-1 or RAG-2 possess comparable cleavage, rejoining, and end-processing activity, as well as similar usage preferences for canonical versus cryptic recombination signals. However, recombinase containing full-length RAG-2, but not full-length RAG-1, exhibits dramatically reduced transposition activity in vitro. These data suggest RAG-mediated transposition and rejoining are differentially regulated by the full-length RAG proteins in vivo (the former directly by RAG-2 and the latter indirectly through other factors) and argue that noncore portions of the RAG proteins have little or no direct influence over V(D)J recombinase site specificity.",

    "abstract": "The majority of lymphomas induced in Rag-deficient mice by Moloney murine leukemia virus (MoMuLV) infection express the CD4 and/or CD8 markers, indicating that proviral insertions cause activation of genes affecting the development from CD4−8− pro-T cells into CD4+8+ pre-T cells. Similar to MoMuLV wild-type tumors, 50% of CD4+8+ Rag-deficient tumors carry a provirus near the Pim1 protooncogene. To study the function of PIM proteins in T cell development in a more controlled setting, a Pim1 transgene was crossed into mice deficient in either cytokine or T cell receptor (TCR) signal transduction pathways. Pim1 reconstitutes thymic cellularity in interleukin (IL)-7– and common γ chain–deficient mice. In Pim1-transgenic Rag-deficient mice but notably not in CD3γ-deficient mice, we observed slow expansion of the CD4+8+ thymic compartment to almost normal size. Based on these results, we propose that PIM1 functions as an efficient effector of the IL-7 pathway, thereby enabling Rag-deficient pro-T cells to bypass the pre-TCR–controlled checkpoint in T cell development.",

    "title": "Mobilization of RAG-Generated Signal Ends by Transposition and Insertion In Vivo",
    "abstract": "ABSTRACT In addition to their essential roles in V(D)J recombination, the RAG proteins have been found to catalyze transposition in vitro, but it has been difficult to demonstrate transposition by the RAG proteins in vivo in vertebrate cells. As genomic instability and chromosomal translocations are common outcomes of transposition in other species, it is critical to understand if the RAG proteins behave as a transposase in vertebrate cells. To facilitate this, we have developed an episome-based assay to detect products of RAG-mediated transposition in the human embryonic kidney cell line 293T. Transposition events into the target episome, accompanied by characteristic target site duplications, were detected at a low frequency using RAG1 and either truncated “core” RAG2 or full-length RAG2. More frequently, insertion of the RAG-generated signal end fragment into the target was accompanied by deletions or more complex rearrangements, and our data indicate that these events occur by a mechanism that is distinct from transposition. An assay to detect transposition from an episome into the human genome failed to detect bona fide transposition events but instead yielded chromosome deletion and translocation events involving the signal end fragment mobilized by the RAG proteins. These assays provide a means of assessing RAG-mediated transposition in vivo, and our findings provide insight into the potential for the products of RAG-mediated DNA cleavage to cause genome instability.",

    "abstract": "Motivation Understanding RNA's structural diversity is vital for identifying novel RNA structures and pursuing RNA genomics initiatives. By classifying RNA secondary motifs based on correlations between conserved RNA secondary structures and functional properties, we offer an avenue for predicting novel motifs. Although several RNA databases exist, no comprehensive schemes are available for cataloguing the range and diversity of RNA's structural repertoire. Results Our RNA-As-Graphs (RAG) database describes and ranks all mathematically possible (including existing and candidate) RNA secondary motifs on the basis of graphical enumeration techniques. We represent RNA secondary structures as two-dimensional graphs (networks), specifying the connectivity between RNA secondary structural elements, such as loops, bulges, stems and junctions. We archive RNA tree motifs as ‘tree graphs’ and other RNAs, including pseudoknots, as general ‘dual graphs’. All RNA motifs are catalogued by graph vertex number (a measure of sequence length) and ranked by topological complexity. The RAG inventory immediately suggests candidates for novel RNA motifs, either naturally occurring or synthetic, and thereby might stimulate the prediction and design of novel RNA motifs.

    "abstract": "Recent studies have shown that TCR beta chain expression can effect the differentiation of CD4-CD8- double-negative (DN) thymocytes to CD4+CD8+ double-positive (DP) thymocytes. The TCR beta chain is expressed on the surface of DP thymocytes in association with CD3 gamma, delta and epsilon chains, suggesting a potential role for CD3 components in this signaling process. We now report detection of a very low level of surface expression of CD3 epsilon on adult DN RAG-2-/- thymocytes. This surface CD3 epsilon was associated with CD3 gamma and delta chains, as detected by anti-CD3 epsilon immunoprecipitation analyses. Significantly, injection of anti-CD3 epsilon mAb into RAG-2-/- mice led to the accumulation of an IL-2R alpha- CD2+ DP cell population and a nearly 100-fold increase in thymic cellularity to essentially normal levels. Together, these data strongly indicate that TCR beta chain-mediated developmental signals are transduced by CD3 components and provide potential insights into mechanisms by which TCR beta chain expression may effect this process.",

    "abstract": "The RAG-1 protein plays an essential role in V(D)j recombination, but its exact function has not yet been defined. Here we report that a particular mutation in RAG-1 affects recombination by altering the specificity of target sequence usage. Recombination mediated by wild-type RAG-1 is tolerant of a wide range of coding sequences adjacent to the recombination signal. With the mutant RAG-1, recombination is much more demanding; efficient recombination is only found when particular dinucleotides are adjacent to the signal sequence heptamer. The mutant is also more sensitive than wild-type RAG-1 to certain alterations within the signal sequence. We suggest that the RAG-1 protein may interact physically with the target DNA at the coding-signal sequence border.",

    "title": "The DDE Motif in RAG-1 Is Contributed intrans to a Single Active Site That Catalyzes the Nicking and Transesterification Steps of V(D)J Recombination",
    "abstract": "ABSTRACT The process of assembling immunoglobulin and T-cell receptor genes from variable (V), diversity (D), and joining (J) gene segments, called V(D)J recombination, involves the introduction of DNA breaks at recombination signals. DNA cleavage is catalyzed by RAG-1 and RAG-2 in two chemical steps: first-strand nicking, followed by hairpin formation via direct transesterification. In vitro, these reactions minimally proceed in discrete protein-DNA complexes containing dimeric RAG-1 and one or two RAG-2 monomers bound to a single recombination signal sequence. Recently, a DDE triad of carboxylate residues essential for catalysis was identified in RAG-1. This catalytic triad resembles the DDE motif often associated with transposase and retroviral integrase active sites. To investigate which RAG-1 subunit contributes the residues of the DDE triad to the recombinase active site, cleavage of intact or prenicked DNA substrates was analyzed in situ in complexes containing RAG-2 and a RAG-1 heterodimer that carried an active-site mutation targeted to the same or opposite RAG-1 subunit mutated to be incompetent for DNA binding. The results show that the DDE triad is contributed to a single recombinase active site, which catalyzes the nicking and transesterification steps of V(D)J recombination by a single RAG-1 subunit opposite the one bound to the nonamer of the recombination signal undergoing cleavage (cleavage intrans). The implications of a trans cleavage mode observed in these complexes on the organization of the V(D)J synaptic complex are discussed.",

    "abstract": "To investigate potential roles of the RAG-1 and RAG-2 gene products in Ig heavy chain class recombination (CSR), we have generated RAG-1(-/-) and RAG-2(-/-) mice which contain both a rearranged Ig HC V(D)J gene (referred to as B1-8) inserted into the endogenous Ig heavy chain (HC) locus in place of the JH segments, and a rearranged lambda1 light chain (LC) transgene (which are referred to as RAG-1(-/-)B1-8lambda and RAG-2(-/-)B1-8lambda mice respectively). The B1-8 HC gene and lambda LC genes encode proteins that associate to form a complete Ig molecule, the expression of which leads to substantial reconstitution of the peripheral B cell compartments of RAG-1(-/-)B1-8lambda and RAG-2(-/-)B1-8lambda mice. Both RAG-1(-/-)B1-8lambda and RAG-2(-/-)B1-8lambda mice have relatively normal levels of the various IgG isotypes, but greatly reduced levels of serum IgM and IgA compared to normal littermates. Furthermore, RAG-1(-/-)B1-8lambda and RAG-2(-/-)B1-8lambda B cells activated in vitro with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or LPS plus IL-4 responded similarly to control B cells with respect to surface expression and secretion of IgG3, IgG1, IgG2b, IgG2a and IgE, but again were deficient in the secretion of IgM. Together, these findings indicate that neither RAG-1 nor RAG-2 expression is required for efficient class switching to most HC isotypes in B cells.",

    "abstract": "The primary repertoire of B and T cells is established by V(D)J recombination. Two closely linked genes, RAG-1 and RAG-2, are essential for this process, and have been identified in mice, humans, and chickens. To study lymphocyte development in Xenopus laevis, we have characterized RAG-1 and RAG-2 in this species and examined their patterns of expression. Degenerate oligonucleotides, based on the known highly conserved RAG-1 sequences, were used to amplify, by the polymerase chain reaction, a segment of Xenopus RAG-1 from genomic DNA. A product of expected size was obtained and used to identify a genomic clone that contained the complete coding region of RAG-1 (1045 codons), and approximately the 3'-half of the coding region of RAG-2. The coding regions of RAG-1 and RAG-2 each lie on a single exon, are in opposite transcriptional orientation, and are separated by approximately 6 kb. The sequence of the remainder of RAG-2 was determined by PCR amplification of genomic DNA, with primers based on sequence analysis of RAG-2 cDNA clones. The predicted Xenopus RAG-1 protein is 71% identical in amino acid sequence to the sequences of each of the mouse, human, and chicken proteins; from position 392 to 1012 the identity is 88%. The coding region of Xenopus RAG-2 (520 codons) is somewhat less conserved among the different species. Tissue-specific expression of Xenopus RAG-1 and RAG-2 was examined both by Northern blotting and by a reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction assay. In juvenile frogs, the highest levels of RAG-1 and RAG-2 expression were observed in the thymus, with lower levels in liver and spleen, and even lower levels in the kidneys. In adults, the thymus and bone marrow were found to be the principal sites of expression of both genes. RAG-2, but not RAG-1, was expressed in oocytes.",

Furthermore, the presence of rag-1 alters the behavior of rag-2, conferring on it properties similar to those of rag-1 and changing its distribution in the nucleus. We demonstrate that rag-1 and rag-2 are present in the same complex by coimmunoprecipitation, and we provide evidence that these complexes contain more molecules of rag-2 than of rag-1. The demonstration of intracellular complexes containing rag-1 and rag-2 raises the possibility that interaction between these proteins is necessary for their biological function.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT V(D)J recombination is initiated by double-strand cleavage at recombination signal sequences (RSSs). DNA cleavage is mediated by the RAG1 and RAG2 proteins. Recent experiments describing RAG protein-RSS complexes, while defining the interaction of RAG1 with the nonamer, have not assigned contacts immediately adjacent to the site of DNA cleavage to either RAG polypeptide. Here we use UV cross-linking to define sequence- and site-specific interactions between RAG1 protein and both the heptamer element of the RSS and the coding flank DNA. Hence, RAG1-DNA contacts span the site of cleavage. We also detect cross-linking of RAG2 protein to some of the same nucleotides that cross-link to RAG1, indicating that, in the binding complex, both RAG proteins are in close proximity to the site of cleavage. These results suggest how the heptamer element, the recognition surface essential for DNA cleavage, is recognized by the RAG proteins and have implications for the stoichiometry and active site organization of the RAG1-RAG2-RSS complex.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT We have studied the interaction between recombination signal sequences (RSSs) and protein products of the truncated forms of recombination-activating genes (RAG) by gel mobility shift, DNase I footprinting, and methylation interference assays. Methylation interference with dimethyl sulfate demonstrated that binding was blocked by methylation in the nonamer at the second-position G residue in the bottom strand and at the sixth- and seventh-position A residues in the top strand. DNase I footprinting experiments demonstrated that RAG1 alone, or even a RAG1 homeodomain peptide, gave footprint patterns very similar to those obtained with the RAG1-RAG2 complex. In the heptamer, partial methylation interference was observed at the sixth-position A residue in the bottom strand. In DNase I footprinting, the heptamer region was weakly protected in the bottom strand by RAG1. The effects of RSS mutations on RAG binding were evaluated by DNA footprinting. Comparison of the RAG-RSS footprint data with the published Hin model confirmed the notion that sequence-specific RSS-RAG interaction takes place primarily between the Hin domain of the RAG1 protein and adjacent major and minor grooves of the nonamer DNA.",

A study of the regulation of the mouse RAG-2 promoter showed that the lymphocyte-specific promoter activity is conferred 80 nucleotide (nt) upstream of RAG-2. Using an electrophoretic mobility shift assay, it was shown that a B-cell-specific transcription protein, Pax-5, and a T-cell-specific transcription protein, GATA-3, bind to the -80 to -17 nt region in B cells and T cells, respectively. Mutation of the RAG-2 promoter for Pax-5- and GATA-3-binding sites results in the reduction of promoter activity in B cells and T cells. These results indicate that distinct DNA binding proteins, Pax-5 and GATA-3, may regulate the murine RAG-2 promoter in B and T lineage cells, respectively. (Blood. 2000;95:3845-3852)",

    "title": "Nucleolus organizers in Mus musculus subspecies and in the RAG mouse cell line.",
    "abstract": "Silver staining has been used to detect active nucleolus organizer regions (NOR's). By this criterion six mouse chromosomes, numbers 12, 15, 16, 17, 18 and 19, can have an NOR. The number and distribution of chromosomes with NOR's vary among inbred strains of Mus musculus musculus (C57BL/6J, BALB/cJ, C3H/HeJ and C3H/StCpr1BR) and in M. musculus molossinus. In a musculus X molassinus F1 hybrid, nucleolus organizers from each parent are silver stained.--Chromosomes which have NOR's in diploid cells also show them in tetraploid cells and in established cell lines. The BALB/cJ strain shows Ag-staining of NOR's on chromosomes 12, 15, 18 and occasionally 16. In the RAG cell line, which was derived from BALB/c, active NOR's are seen on 12, 15 and 18, even after these chromosomes have undergone structural rearrangements in the cell line. Some correlation exists between the amount of Ag-stain and the size of a secondary construction region, with a large amount of Ag-stain present on a chromosome which has a prominent secondary constriction. There is no correlation between the amount of Ag-stain and the presence or absence of C-band material.",

    "abstract": "Some natural isolates and many laboratory strains of the yeast Kluyveromyces lactis cannot grow on glucose when respiration is inhibited by antimycin A. The ability or inability to grow on glucose in the absence of mitochondrial respiration has been called Rag+ or Rag− phenotype (resistance to antimycin on glucose, respectively). Rag− strains, unable to grow on glucose in the presence of the respiratory drug, behave as if they were defective in fermentation. The Rag phenotype was first found to be determined by variant alleles of either of the two nuclear genes, RAG1 and RAG2, which code for a low‐affinity glucose transport protein and for phosphoglucose isomerase, respectively. These findings suggested that the Rag− phenotype can be used to obtain mutations of genes involved in glucose metabolism in K. lactis. We thus looked for other Rag− mutants. Seventy‐four mutants were isolated and genetically characterized. All of the mutations were nuclear recessive alleles, defining 11 new complementation groups, which we designate rag3 through rag13.",

    "title": "Gene therapy of RAG-2-/- mice: sustained correction of the immunodeficiency.",
    "abstract": "Patients with mutations of either RAG-1 or RAG-2 genes suffer from severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) characterized by the lack of T and B lymphocytes. The only curative treatment today consists of hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) transplantation, which is only partially successful in the absence of an HLA genoidentical donor, thus justifying research to find an alternative therapeutic approach. To this end, RAG-2-deficient mice were used to test whether retrovirally mediated ex vivo gene transfer into HSCs could provide long-term correction of the immunologic deficiency. Murine RAG-2-/-Sca-1(+) selected bone marrow cells were transduced with a modified Moloney leukemia virus (MLV)-based MND (myeloproliferative sarcoma virus enhancer, negative control region deleted, dl587rev primer-binding site substituted) retroviral vector containing the RAG-2 cDNA and transplanted into RAG-2-/- sublethally irradiated mice (3Gy). Two months later, T- and B-cell development was achieved in all mice. Diverse repertoire of T cells as well as proliferative capacity in the presence of mitogens, allogeneic cells, and keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH) were shown. B-cell function as shown by serum Ig levels and antibody response to a challenge by KLH also developed. Lymphoid subsets and function were shown to be stable over a one-year period without evidence of any detectable toxicity. Noteworthy, a selective advantage for transduced lymphoid cells was evidenced by comparative provirus quantification in lymphoid and myeloid lineages. Altogether, this study demonstrates the efficiency of ex vivo RAG-2 gene transfer in HSCs to correct the immune deficiency of RAG-2-/- mice, constituting a significant step toward clinical application.",

    "abstract": "It has been speculated that autoimmune diseases are caused by failure of central tolerance. However, this remains controversial. We have suggested that CD40 expression identifies autoaggressive T cells in the periphery of autoimmune prone mice. In this study, we report that CD40 was cloned from autoaggressive T cells and that engagement induces expression and nuclear translocation of the recombinases, recombination activating gene (RAG) 1 and RAG2 in the autoaggressive, but not in the nonautoaggressive, peripheral T cell population. Furthermore, we demonstrate that CD40 engagement induces altered TCR Vα, but not Vβ, expression in these cells. Therefore, CD40-regulated expression of RAG1 and RAG2 in peripheral T cells may constitute a novel pathway for the generation of autoaggressive T cells.",

    "abstract": "Transgenic mice carrying either the c‐myc or N‐myc oncogene deregulated by the immunoglobulin heavy chain enhancer element (E mu) develop both pre‐B and B cell lymphomas (E mu‐c‐myc and E mu‐N‐myc lymphomas). We report here that B cell lines derived from these tumors, as well as a line derived from v‐myc retroviral transformation, simultaneously express surface immunoglobulin (a hallmark of mature B cells) as well as a common subset of genes normally restricted to the pre‐B stage of development‐including the recombinase activating genes RAG‐1 and RAG‐2. Continued RAG‐1 and RAG‐2 expression in these lines is associated with VDJ recombinase activity detected with a VDJ recombination substrate. Cross‐linking of the surface immunoglobulin on these lines with an anti‐mu antibody leads to rapid, specific and reversible down‐regulation of RAG‐1 and RAG‐2 gene expression. We also find that a small but significant percentage of normal surface immunoglobulin bearing bone marrow B cells express the RAG‐1 gene. These findings are discussed in the context of their possible implications for the control of specific gene expression during the pre‐B to B cell transition.",

    "abstract": "Severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) caused by mutations in RAG1 or RAG2 genes is characterized by a complete block in T- and B-cell development. The only curative treatment is allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, which gives a high survival rate (90%) when an HLA-genoidentical donor exists but unsatisfactory results when only partially compatible donors are available. We have thus been interested in the development of a potential alternative treatment by using retroviral gene transfer of a normal copy of RAG1 cDNA. We show here that this approach applied to RAG-1-deficient mice restores normal B- and T-cell function even in the presence of a reduced number of mature B cells. The reconstitution is stable over time, attesting to a selective advantage of transduced progenitors. Notably, a high transgene copy number was detected in all lymphoid organs, and this was associated with a risk of lymphoproliferation as observed in one mouse. Altogether, these results demonstrate that correction of RAG-1 deficiency can be achieved by gene therapy in immunodeficient mice but that human application would require the use of self-inactivated vector to decrease the risk of lymphoproliferative diseases.",

The signaling pathway that regulates these events is poorly characterized. We demonstrate that immature B cells from mice deficient in the PI3K catalytic subunit p110δ fail to suppress RAG expression and inappropriately recombine κ and λ LC loci. In addition, in the presence of the autoantigen, clonal deletion and receptor editing still takes place, demonstrating that these processes are independent of p110δ.

    "title": "c-Myb Binds to a Sequence in the Proximal Region of the RAG-2 Promoter and Is Essential for Promoter Activity in T-Lineage Cells",
    "abstract": "ABSTRACT The RAG-2 gene encodes a component of the V(D)J recombinase which is essential for the assembly of antigen receptor genes in B and T lymphocytes. Previously, we reported that the transcription factor BSAP (PAX-5) regulates the murine RAG-2 promoter in B-cell lines. A partially overlapping but distinct region of the proximal RAG-2 promoter was also identified as an important element for promoter activity in T cells; however, the responsible factor was unknown. In this report, we present data demonstrating that c-Myb binds to a Myb consensus site within the proximal promoter and is critical for its activity in T-lineage cells. We show that c-Myb can transactivate a RAG-2 promoter-reporter construct in cotransfection assays and that this transactivation depends on the proximal promoter Myb consensus site. By using a chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) strategy, fractionation of chromatin with anti-c-Myb antibody specifically enriched endogenous RAG-2 promoter DNA sequences. DNase I genomic footprinting revealed that the c-Myb site is occupied in a tissue-specific fashion in vivo. Furthermore, an integrated RAG-2 promoter construct with mutations at the c-Myb site was not enriched in the ChIP assay, while a wild-type integrated promoter construct was enriched. Finally, this lack of binding of c-Myb to a chromosomally integrated mutant RAG-2 promoter construct in vivo was associated with a striking decrease in promoter activity. We conclude that c-Myb regulates the RAG-2 promoter in T cells by binding to this consensus c-Myb binding site.",

    "abstract": "Emulsan is an extracellular polymeric bioemulsifier produced by Acinetobacter calcoaceticus RAG-1. Antibodies prepared against purified emulsan inhibited the activity of the polymer in a standard emulsification test. These antibodies were used to develop a sensitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay to monitor changes in cell-free emulsan throughout the growth cycle. This assay was also used to detect emulsan associated with the cell surface and to monitor changes in the distribution of cell-free and cell-associated emulsan throughout the growth cycle. Cells in the early exponential phase exhibited relatively large amounts of cell-associated emulsan which decreased rapidly between the midexponential and early stationary phases. This drop in cell-associated material was accompanied by a rise in the concentration of extracellular polymer. Moreover, in agreement with previous results (C. Rubinovitz, D. L. Gutnick, and E. Rosenberg, manuscript in press), production of cell-free emulsan was enhanced in the presence of chloramphenicol. The release of this material from the cell surface in the presence of chloramphenicol apparently involved the synthesis of cell-associated cross-reacting material since the relative amount of such cell-bound polymer remained constant during the treatment with the drug.",

    "abstract": "The purified extracellular emulsifying factor produced by Arthrobacter RAG-1 (EF-RAG) emulsified light petroleum oil, diesel oil, and a variety of crude oils and gas oils. Although kerosine and gasoline were emulsified poorly by EF-RAG, they were converted into good substrates for emulsification by addition of aromatic compounds, such as 2-methylnaphthalene. Neither aromatic nor aliphatic fractions of crude oil were emulsified by EF-RAG; however, mixtures containing both fractions were emulsified. Pure aliphatic or aromatic hydrocarbons were emulsified poorly by EF-RAG. Binary mixtures containing an aliphatic and an aromatic hydrocarbon, however, were excellent substrates for EF-RAG-induced emulsification. Of a variety of alkylcyclohexane and alkylbenzene derivatives tested, only hexyl- or heptylbenzene and octyl- or decylcyclohexane were effectively emulsified by EF-RAG. These data indicate that for EF-RAG to induce emulsification of hydrocarbons in water, the hydrocarbon substrate must contain both aliphatic and cyclic components. With binary mixtures of methylnaphthalene and hexadecane, maximum emulsion was obtained with 25% hexadecane.",

    "title": "Alternative Pathways for the Repair of RAG-Induced DNA Breaks",
    "abstract": "ABSTRACT RAG1 and RAG2 cleave DNA to generate blunt signal ends and hairpin coding ends at antigen receptor loci in lymphoid cells. During V(D)J recombination, repair of these RAG-generated double-strand breaks (DSBs) by the nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ) pathway contributes substantially to the antigen receptor diversity necessary for immune system function, although recent evidence also supports the ability of RAG-generated breaks to undergo homology-directed repair (HDR). We have determined that RAG-generated chromosomal breaks can be repaired by pathways other than NHEJ in mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells, although repair by these pathways occurs at a significantly lower frequency than NHEJ. HDR frequency was estimated to be ≥40-fold lower than NHEJ frequency for both coding end and signal end reporters. Repair by single-strand annealing was estimated to occur at a comparable or lower frequency than HDR. As expected, V(D)J recombination was substantially impaired in cells deficient for the NHEJ components Ku70, XRCC4, and DNA-PKcs. Concomitant with decreased NHEJ, RAG-induced HDR was increased in each of the mutants, including cells lacking DNA-PKcs, which has been implicated in hairpin opening. HDR was increased to the largest extent in Ku70 − / − cells, implicating the Ku70/80 DNA end-binding protein in regulating pathway choice. Thus, RAG-generated DSBs are typically repaired by the NHEJ pathway in ES cells, but in the absence of NHEJ components, a substantial fraction of breaks can be efficiently channeled into alternative pathways in these cells.",

    "title": "Seven Failure Points When Engineering a Retrieval Augmented Generation System",
    "abstract": "Software engineers are increasingly adding semantic search capabilities to applications using a strategy known as Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG). A RAG system involves finding documents that semantically match a query and then passing the documents to a large language model (LLM) such as ChatGPT to extract the right answer using an LLM. RAG systems aim to: a) reduce the problem of hallucinated responses from LLMs, b) link sources/references to generated responses, and c) remove the need for annotating documents with meta-data. However, RAG systems suffer from limitations inherent to information retrieval systems and from reliance on LLMs. In this paper, we present an experience report on the failure points of RAG systems from three case studies from separate domains: research, education, and biomedical. We share the lessons learned and present 7 failure points to consider when designing a RAG system. The two key takeaways arising from our work are: 1) validation of a RAG system is only feasible during operation, and 2) the robustness of a RAG system evolves rather than designed in at the start. We conclude with a list of potential research directions on RAG systems for the software engineering community.CCS CONCEPTS• Software and its engineering → Empirical software validation.",

However, germinal center (GC) B cells have been shown to reexpress recombination-activating gene (RAG)-1 and RAG-2 proteins in immunized mice. Here, we present several lines of evidence indicating that RAG proteins thus induced are functional as the V(D)J recombinase. DNA excision product reflecting Vλ1 to Jλ1 rearrangement was generated in parallel with the expression of RAG genes in mature mouse B cells that were activated in vitro with LPS and IL-4. Similar λ chain gene rearrangement was observed in the draining lymph node of immunized mice. Further, B cells that underwent λ gene rearrangement were shown by in situ PCR to be localized within GCs. Thus, secondary rearrangement of Ig genes (receptor editing) can occur in mature B cells.",

    "abstract": "Antigen-binding diversity is generated by site-specific V(D)J recombination of the T cell receptor (TCR) and immunoglobulin loci in lymphocyte precursors. Coordinate expression of two structurally distinct recombinase activating genes, RAG-1 and RAG-2, is necessary for activation of site-specific V(D)J recombination. In mice bearing targeted disruptions of either the RAG-1 or RAG-2 genes, T and B lymphocyte development is arrested at the CD4-8- double negative (DN) thymocyte or B220+/CD43+ pro-B cell stage. Development of CD4+CD8+ double positive (DP) thymocytes is restored by expression of a functionally rearranged TCR beta transgene, suggesting that TCR beta expression is critical for this developmental transition. We have found that treatment of adult or newborn RAG-deficient mice with a single sublethal dose of gamma-irradiation rescues the DN to DP transition in early thymocytes, and this is accompanied by a dramatic increase in thymus cellularity. In contrast to the observed induction of thymocyte maturation, there was no phenotypic or functional evidence of coincident B lymphocyte development in irradiated RAG-deficient mice. Interestingly, maturation of DP thymocytes occurred without expression of TCR beta protein in the cytoplasm or on the cell surface. These results suggest an in vivo pathway for DP thymocyte development which is TCR beta chain independent.",

    "abstract": "Chicken B cells diversify their immunoglobulin genes by gene conversion in the bursa of Fabricius. The avian leukosis virus-induced B-cell line DT40 continues to diversify its immunoglobulin light chain locus by gene conversion during in vitro passage. Since a variable(diversity)joining recombination-activating gene, RAG-2, is specifically expressed in chicken B cells undergoing immunoglobulin gene conversion, it has been suggested that RAG-2 may be involved in the immunoglobulin gene conversion process. We previously reported high ratios of targeted to random integration after transfection of genomic DNA constructs into DT40. This allows us to easily investigate the function of a gene product by gene disruption. We show here that subclones of DT40 maintain the ability to diversify their immunoglobulin light chain locus by gene conversion even after both copies of the RAG-2 coding regions are deleted. These results demonstrate that the RAG-2 product is not required for gene conversion activity in the immunoglobulin light chain locus.",

    "abstract": "V(D)J recombination occurs in immature B cells within primary lymphoid organs. However, recent evidence demonstrated that the recombination activating genes RAG‐1 and RAG‐2 can also be expressed in murine germinal centers (GC) where they can mediate secondary rearrangements. This finding raises a number of interesting questions, the most important of which is what is the physiological role, if any, of secondary immunoglobulin (Ig) gene rearrangements. In the present report, we provide evidence that human GC B cells that have lost surface immunoglobulin re‐express RAG‐1 and RAG‐2, suggesting that they may be able to undergo Ig rearrangement. Furthermore, we describe two mature B cell clones in which secondary rearrangements have possibly occurred, resulting in light chain replacement. The two clones carry both κ and λ light chains productively rearranged, but fail to express the κ chain on the cell surface due to a stop codon acquired by somatic mutation. Interestingly, the analysis of the extent of somatic mutations accumulated by the two light chains might suggest that the λ chain could have been acquired through a secondary rearrangement. Taken together, these data suggest that secondary Ig gene rearrangements leading to replacement may occur in human GC and may contribute to the peripheral B cell repertoire.",

RAGs are normally expressed during a narrow window of precursor lymphocyte development. RAG expression was examined in Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-infected B cells. No steady-state RAG RNA was found in EBV immortalized cells, including newly established B lymphoblastoid cell lines derived from precursor lymphocytes that transcribed RAGs at the time of infection. RAG RNAs were detected in some endemic (EBV+) and also in some sporadic (EBV-) Burkitt's lymphoma lines that had been infected with EBV in vitro. The RAG+, EBV+ Burkitt's lines were unusual in that they were SIgM+ (one was SIgG+, SIgM-), CD10+, and lacked terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase. In EBV+ Burkitt's lymphoma lines, transcription of virus latent membrane protein-1 (LMP-1) was correlated with downregulation of RAG-1 and RAG-2. Conversely, absence of LMP-1 in clones of EBV+ tumor lines was associated with increased RAG transcription. Translocation of c-myc into V(D)J loci has been observed in endemic Burkitt's lymphomas, and heptamer-nonamer recombination signal sequences have been identified at some chromosomal breakpoints. Association of RAG transcription with EBV infection raises the possibility that, under certain conditions, virus might predispose to aberrant V(D)J recombination reactions.",

    "abstract": "Three sources of help for the development of a CD8+ CTL response have been described: the CD4+ direct and indirect pathways and the CD8+ direct pathway. In an effort to understand the minimal requirements for the development of a CTL response in vivo, we have bred mice transgenic for the 2C TCR onto a RAG(-/-) background. The 2C T cells in this animal are exclusively CD8+ CTLs of a single specificity, and they exhibit altered thymic maturation compared with that of T cells from 2C TCR/RAG(+/+) mice. T cells from 2C TCR/RAG(-/-) mice can be activated to a high level in vivo by administration of a self-MHC-restricted antigenic peptide. The 2C TCR/RAG(-/-) mice are able to reject B7-negative allogeneic tumors bearing the appropriate peptide/MHC ligand p2C/Ld. These mice fail to reject syngeneic tumors, and their RAG(-/-) littermates lacking 2C T cells uniformly succumb to both allogeneic and syngeneic tumors. Moreover, blockade of B7 costimulatory molecules fails to prevent tumor rejection in the 2C TCR/RAG(-/-) mice, suggesting that allorejection is occurring independently of B7-mediated costimulation as well as in the absence of CD4+ T cells. CTLs isolated from the site of the tumor during the period of rejection express the activation marker CD25 and are able to mediate ex vivo cytolysis of tumor cells bearing the appropriate Ag. These results suggest that in this TCR transgenic model with a very high precursor frequency, CTL development can occur in the absence of B7:CD28 costimulation and without CD4+ help.",

    "title": "RAG-Mediated V(D)J Recombination Is Not Essential for Tumorigenesis in Atm-Deficient Mice",
    "abstract": "ABSTRACT Atm-deficient mice die of malignant thymic lymphomas characterized by translocations within the Tcrα/δ locus, suggesting that tumorigenesis is secondary to aberrant responses to double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) breaks that occur during RAG-dependent V(D)J recombination. We recently demonstrated that development of thymic lymphoma in Atm−/− mice was not prevented by loss of RAG-2. Thymic lymphomas that developed in Rag2−/− Atm−/− mice contained multiple chromosomal abnormalities, but none of these involved the Tcrα/δ locus. These findings indicated that tumorigenesis in Atm−/− mice is mediated by chromosomal translocations secondary to aberrant responses to dsDNA breaks and that V(D)J recombination is an important, but not essential, event in susceptibility. In contrast to these findings, it was recently reported that Rag1−/− Atm−/− mice do not develop thymic lymphomas, a finding that was interpreted as demonstrating a requirement for RAG-dependent recombination in the susceptibility to tumors in Atm-deficient mice. To test the possibility that RAG-1 and RAG-2 differ in their roles in tumorigenesis, we studied Rag1−/− Atm−/− mice in parallel to our previous Rag2−/− Atm−/− study. We found that thymic lymphomas occur at high frequency in Rag1−/− Atm−/− mice and resemble those that occur in Rag2−/− Atm−/− mice. These results indicate that both RAG-1 and RAG-2 are necessary for tumorigenesis involving translocation in the Tcrα/δ locus but that Atm deficiency leads to tumors through a broader RAG-independent predisposition to translocation, related to a generalized defect in dsDNA break repair.",

    "title": "Antigen-Independent Appearance of Recombination Activating Gene (Rag)-Positive Bone Marrow B Cells in the Spleens of Immunized Mice",
    "abstract": "Splenic B lineage cells expressing recombination activation genes (RAG+) in mice immunized with 4-hydroxy-3-nitrophenyl-acetyl coupled to chicken γ-globulin (NP-CGG) and the adjuvant aluminum-hydroxide (alum) have been proposed to be mature B cells that reexpress RAG after an antigen encounter in the germinal center (GC), a notion supported by findings of RAG expression in peripheral B lymphocyte populations activated in vitro. However, recent studies indicate that these cells might be immature B cells that have not yet extinguished RAG expression. Here, we employ RAG2–green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion gene knock-in mice to show that RAG+ B lineage cells do appear in the spleen after the administration of alum alone, and that their appearance is independent of T cell interactions via the CD40 pathway. Moreover, splenic RAG+ B lineage cells were detectable in immunized RAG2-deficient mice adoptively transferred with bone marrow (BM) cells, but not with spleen cells from RAG+ mice. Although splenic RAG+ B cells express surface markers associated with GC B cells, we also find the same basic markers on progenitor/precursor BM B cells. Finally, we did not detect RAG gene expression after the in vitro stimulation of splenic RAG− mature B cells with mitogens (lipopolysaccharide and anti-CD40) and cytokines (interleukin [IL]-4 and IL-7). Together, our studies indicate that RAG+ B lineage cells from BM accumulate in the spleen after immunization, and that this accumulation is not the result of an antigen-specific response.",

By classifying RNA secondary motifs based on correlations between conserved RNA secondary structures and functional properties, we offer an avenue for predicting novel motifs. Although several RNA databases exist, no comprehensive schemes are available for cataloguing the range and diversity of RNA's structural repertoire.\n\n\nRESULTS\nOur RNA-As-Graphs (RAG) database describes and ranks all mathematically possible (including existing and candidate) RNA secondary motifs on the basis of graphical enumeration techniques. We represent RNA secondary structures as two-dimensional graphs (networks), specifying the connectivity between RNA secondary structural elements, such as loops, bulges, stems and junctions. We archive RNA tree motifs as 'tree graphs' and other RNAs, including pseudoknots, as general 'dual graphs'. All RNA motifs are catalogued by graph vertex number (a measure of sequence length) and ranked by topological complexity. The RAG inventory immediately suggests candidates for novel RNA motifs, either naturally occurring or synthetic, and thereby might stimulate the prediction and design of novel RNA motifs.\n\n\nAVAILABILITY\nThe database is accessible on the web at http://monod.biomath.nyu.edu/rna",

    "abstract": "The recombination activating gene-1 (RAG-1) and RAG-2 are expressed specifically in immature lymphoid cells undergoing the recombination of antigen receptor genes. The regulation of murine RAG-2 promoter was studied and it was revealed that the -41/-17 RAG-2 promoter region, which is conserved between humans and mice, was indispensable for the RAG-2 promoter activity in B-cell lines. The region contained 2 cis elements that bound c-Myb and Pax-5. Mutation in the c-Myb-binding site in the promoter reduced the promoter activity in B-cell lines. Cooperative activation of the RAG-2 promoter was seen by a combination of c-Myb and Pax-5 in a human embryonic kidney cell line (293T), via their synergistic DNA-binding. Deletion experiments showed that the C-terminus of c-Myb was responsible for their interaction. Furthermore, the dominant-negative c-Myb mutant suppressed the activation of the RAG-2 promoter in a pre-B-cell line as well as in 293T cells. These results suggest that cooperative binding of c-Myb and Pax-5 to the RAG-2 promoter is one of the mechanisms to direct the restricted expression of the RAG-2 in immature B cells.",

    "abstract": "We investigated the effect of B-cell reconstitution in immune-deficient Rag-1 knockout (KO) mice subjected to arterial injury. After 21 days, injury induced a 4- to 5-fold increase in neointimal formation in Rag-1 KO mice fed normal chow compared with wild-type (WT) mice (0.020±0.0160 [n=8] versus 0.0049±0.0022 [n=8] mm2, respectively;P <0.05) and in western-type diet–fed Rag-1 KO mice compared with WT mice (0.0312±0.0174 [n=7] versus 0.0050±0.0028 [n=6] mm2, respectively;P <0.05). To investigate the role of B cells in response to injury, Rag-1 KO mice were reconstituted with B cells derived from the spleens of WT mice, with donors and recipients on the same diet. Reconstitution of Rag-1 KO mice with B cells from WT mice (both fed normal chow) reduced neointimal formation compared with the effect in unreconstituted Rag-1 KO mice (0.0076±0.0039 [n=9] versus 0.020±0.0160 [n=8] mm2, respectively;P <0.05). Reconstitution of Rag-1 KO mice with B cells from WT mice (both fed a western diet) reduced neointimal formation compared the effect in Rag-1 KO mice (0.0087±0.0037 [n=8] versus 0.0312±0.0174 [n=7] mm2, respectively;P <0.05). Injured carotid arteries from reconstituted Rag-1 KO mice had detectable IgM and IgG, indicating viable transfer of B cells.

    "abstract": "The ability of Acinetobacter calcoaceticus RAG-1 to adhere to human epithelial cells was investigated and compared with its ability to adhere to a test hydrocarbon (hexadecane). RAG-1, a microorganism originally isolated for growth on hydrocarbon, adhered to epithelial cells when grown under conditions which promote its adherence to hexadecane; similarly, RAG-1 cells adhered poorly to epithelial cells when grown under conditions which cause the cells to possess low affinity towards hexadecane. A mutant derived from RAG-1, MR-481, deficient in its ability to adhere to hydrocarbon, was similarly unable to adhere to epithelial cells. RAG-1 adherence to epithelial cells was not blocked by a number of sugars tested. Streptococcus pyogenes, whose adherence to epithelial cells has been previously attributed to hydrophobic interactions, was also able to adhere to hexadecane. Results suggest that hydrophobic interactions mediate adherence of the strains studied to both epithelial cells and hydrocarbon.",

Since DA designs are table-based and RAG-n designs are adder-based, FPGA synthesis design data are used for a realistic comparison. Benchmark FIR filters (Goodman and Carey, 1977) of length 11 to 63 are compiled.

    "title": "A complex of RAG-1 and RAG-2 proteins persists on DNA after single-strand cleavage at V(D)J recombination signal sequences.",
    "abstract": "The recombination activating gene (RAG) 1 and 2 proteins are required for initiation of V(D)J recombination in vivo and have been shown to be sufficient to introduce DNA double-strand breaks at recombination signal sequences (RSSs) in a cell-free assay in vitro. RSSs consist of a highly conserved palindromic heptamer that is separated from a slightly less conserved A/T-rich nonamer by either a 12 or 23 bp spacer of random sequence. Despite the high sequence specificity of RAG-mediated cleavage at RSSs, direct binding of the RAG proteins to these sequences has been difficult to demonstrate by standard methods. Even when this can be demonstrated, questions about the order of events for an individual RAG-RSS complex will require methods that monitor aspects of the complex during transitions from one step of the reaction to the next. Here we have used template-independent DNA polymerase terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) in order to assess occupancy of the reaction intermediates by the RAG complex during the reaction. In addition, this approach allows analysis of the accessibility of end products of a RAG-catalyzed cleavage reaction for N nucleotide addition. The results indicate that RAG proteins form a long-lived complex with the RSS once the initial nick is generated, because the 3'-OH group at the nick remains obstructed for TdT-catalyzed N nucleotide addition. In contrast, the 3'-OH group generated at the signal end after completion of the cleavage reaction can be efficiently tailed by TdT, suggesting that the RAG proteins disassemble from the signal end after DNA double-strand cleavage has been completed. Therefore, a single RAG complex maintains occupancy from the first step (nick formation) to the second step (cleavage). In addition, the results suggest that N region diversity at V(D)J junctions within rearranged immunoglobulin and T cell receptor gene loci can only be introduced after the generation of RAG-catalyzed DNA double-strand breaks, i.e. during the DNA end joining phase of the V(D)J recombination reaction.",

    "title": "Increased susceptibility of RAG-2 SCID mice to dissemination of endodontic infections",
    "abstract": "Specific immunity has been implicated in the pathogenesis of periapical lesions, although the extent to which these mechanisms are actually involved in either protection or destruction of the pulp-periapex complex is yet to be established. To investigate this question we compared periapical-lesion pathogenesis in RAG-2 severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice with immunocompetent control mice following surgical pulp exposure. In order to equalize the bacterial challenge, an infection protocol using Prevotella intermedia, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Peptostreptococcus micros, and Streptococcus intermedius was devised. The results demonstrated that after infection, the proportion of the root canal flora represented by the four pathogens was almost identical in both groups (39.9 and 42.2% for RAG-2 and immunocompetent control mice, respectively). The effects of abrogation of T- and B-cell mechanisms on periapical pathogenesis were then assessed. Approximately one-third of the RAG-2 mice developed endodontic abscesses, while no immunocompetent controls had abscesses, results which indicated regional dissemination of the infection. A similar incidence of abscesses was found in two additional experiments. Abscessed RAG-2 teeth had significantly larger periapical lesions than did nonabscessed RAG-2 teeth (P < or = 0.05) and exposed immunocompetent controls (P < or = 0.01), whereas nonabscessed RAG-2 teeth were not significantly different from those of exposed immunocompetent controls in periapical-lesion size. We conclude that B- and T-cell-mediated immunity protects the host from the dissemination of endodontic infections and that RAG-2 mice are more susceptible to infection-induced pulp-periapex destruction.",

    "title": "Different developmental arrest points in RAG-2 -/- and SCID thymocytes on two genetic backgrounds: developmental choices and cell death mechanisms before TCR gene rearrangement.",
    "abstract": "To analyze the early development of T cell precursors in the absence of TCR gene rearrangement, recombinase-activating gene-deficient (RAG-2 -/-) thymocytes were compared with thymocytes from SCID mice on the C.B-17 (BALB) and B6 genetic backgrounds. RAG-2 -/- thymocytes accumulate as quiescent cells with a heat-stable Ag (HSA)-positive CD25+ CD44- c-kit(low) phenotype, resembling normal cells just before selection for functional TCR beta-chain expression. CD44 and c-kit progressively down-regulate in the HSA+ subset, providing a background-independent and TCR-independent developmental clock. On this basis, compared with RAG-2 -/- thymocytes, SCID thymocytes 1) arrest at more heterogeneous, and generally earlier, stages; 2) accumulate to lower overall cell numbers; and 3) maintain higher populations of cycling and activated G1 cells, showing both increased responsiveness and increased cell death. B6-SCID thymocytes appear to die particularly early. Low levels of Fas were observed on \"advanced\" HSA+ SCID thymocytes but not on any RAG-2 -/- thymocytes, suggesting a potential difference in activation state or mechanism of death. In both RAG-2 -/- and SCID thymocytes, there are also two discrete subsets of HSA(low) CD25- CD44+ c-kit+ cells: a Sca-1+ CD44++ CD122- NK1.1- putative progenitor subset and an NK-like Sca-1- CD44+(+) CD122+ NK1.1+ subset. The absolute cell numbers in these HSA(low) subsets and the extent of NK cell differentiation, measured by perforin expression, are nearly constant in all the mutant strains analyzed, in contrast to the HSA+ CD25+ population, which was expanded in the RAG-2 -/-. Thus, the SCID thymocytes appear to undergo a normal generation but a premature death as compared with the RAG-2 -/- thymocytes.",

    "title": "Role of the T cell in the genesis of angiotensin II–induced hypertension and vascular dysfunction",
    "abstract": "Hypertension promotes atherosclerosis and is a major source of morbidity and mortality. We show that mice lacking T and B cells (RAG-1−/− mice) have blunted hypertension and do not develop abnormalities of vascular function during angiotensin II infusion or desoxycorticosterone acetate (DOCA)–salt. Adoptive transfer of T, but not B, cells restored these abnormalities. Angiotensin II is known to stimulate reactive oxygen species production via the nicotinamide adenosine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase in several cells, including some immune cells. Accordingly, adoptive transfer of T cells lacking the angiotensin type I receptor or a functional NADPH oxidase resulted in blunted angiotensin II–dependent hypertension and decreased aortic superoxide production. Angiotensin II increased T cell markers of activation and tissue homing in wild-type, but not NADPH oxidase–deficient, mice. Angiotensin II markedly increased T cells in the perivascular adipose tissue (periadventitial fat) and, to a lesser extent the adventitia. These cells expressed high levels of CC chemokine receptor 5 and were commonly double negative (CD3+CD4−CD8−). This infiltration was associated with an increase in intercellular adhesion molecule-1 and RANTES in the aorta. Hypertension also increased T lymphocyte production of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) α, and treatment with the TNFα antagonist etanercept prevented the hypertension and increase in vascular superoxide caused by angiotensin II. These studies identify a previously undefined role for T cells in the genesis of hypertension and support a role of inflammation in the basis of this prevalent disease. T cells might represent a novel therapeutic target for the treatment of high blood pressure.",

In addition, in the presence of the autoantigen, clonal deletion and receptor editing still takes place, demonstrating that these processes are independent of p110delta. These results demonstrate a role for p110delta in the regulation of RAG gene expression and thereby LC allelic/isotype exclusion.",

SLE patients had increased frequency of RAG‐positive B cells. B‐cell receptor (BCR) engagement induced a shift in the frequency of κ‐ and λ‐positive cells, associated with a persistence of RAG messenger RNA and the maintenance of RAG2 protein within the nucleus. While expression of the RAG2‐negative regulator CDK2 was normal, the positive regulator p27Kip1 was up‐regulated and enhanced by BCR engagement. This effect was the result of the aberrant production of IL‐6 by SLE B cells. Furthermore, IL‐6 receptor blockade led to a reduction in p27Kip1 expression, and allowed the translocation of RAG2 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. Our study indicates that aberrant production of IL‐6 contributes to the inability of SLE B cells to terminate RAG protein production. Therefore, we hypothesize that because of constitutive IL‐6 signalling in association with BCR engagement, SLE B cells would become prone to secondary immunoglobulin gene rearrangements and autoantibody production.",

    "abstract": "Recombinase-activating genes (RAG-1 and RAG-2) are expressed in immature T or B lymphocytes and possess activity to induce V(D)J rearrangement in TCR and Ig genes. We examined their expression in human decidual and non-pregnant endometrial samples using a highly sensitive RT-PCR technique. Expression of RAG-1 and 2 was noted in all (13/13) pregnant decidual tissues obtained at different gestational stages. After anti-human Ig treatment to rule out the possibility of RAG-1,2 expression from decidual B-cells, strong expression of RAGs was still noted in B cell depleted decidual cells in contrast to lymph nodes and PBMC that lost RAG mRNA expression after this treatment. After FACS mediated cell sorting, strong expression of RAG-1,2 was noted in CD16-CD56bright cells and weak expression in CD3+ cells. Although CD16-CD56bright cells lack surface CD3, they express CD3 epsilon mRNA only detectable by RT-PCR. Our results suggest the nature of decidual CD16-CD56bright cells as a progenitor of extrathymic T cells that possess RAG-1 and 2 mRNA as markers of their immaturity, and possibly differentiate into CD3+ extrathymic T-cells in the decidua under the influence of trophoblastic cells. We propose the human decidua as a new site of extrathymic T-cells differentiation and propose possible roles of trophoblastic cells to attract progenitor lymphocytes of bone marrow origin and trigger their TCR rearrangement as thymic epithelial cells.",

    "abstract": "The expression of recombination activating gene (RAG) products, responsible for T cell receptor (TcR) gene rearrangement, is shut off during positive selection of thymocytes. The precise stage at which this down‐regulation occurs remains somewhat controversial. We have analyzed RAG‐1 expression in thymocytes of TcR transgenic mice carried on selecting versus non‐selecting genetic backgrounds, both by in situ hybridization on thymus sections and by polymerase chain reaction amplification of RNA from sorted cells. The data from several transgenic lines indicate that RAG expression is already reduced in immature, cortical, CD4+CD8+ cells in the presence of positively selecting major histocompatibility complex molecules, although complete shut‐off is not achieved until the mature, medullary, single‐positive stage. This finding has practical and theoretical significance for studies on the mechanism of positive selection.",

    "title": "Overlapping Signals for Protein Degradation and Nuclear Localization Define a Role for Intrinsic RAG-2 Nuclear Uptake in Dividing Cells",
    "abstract": "ABSTRACT Expression of the recombinase proteins RAG-1 and RAG-2 is discordant: while RAG-1 is relatively long lived, RAG-2 is degraded periodically at the G1-S transition. Destruction of RAG-2 is mediated by a conserved interval in the recombination-dispensable region. The need for RAG-2 to reaccumulate in the nucleus at each cell division suggested the existence of an intrinsic RAG-2 nuclear localization signal (NLS). RAG-1 or RAG-2, expressed individually, is a nuclear protein. A screen for proteins that bind the recombination-dispensable region of RAG-2 identified the nuclear transport protein Importin 5. Mutation of residues 499 to 508 in RAG-2 abolished Importin 5 binding, nuclear accumulation, and periodic degradation of RAG-2. The Importin 5 binding site overlaps an NLS, defined by mutagenesis. RAG-1 rescued the localization of degradation-defective, RAG-2 NLS mutants; this required an intact RAG-1 NLS. Mutations in RAG-2 that abolish intrinsic nuclear accumulation but spare periodic degradation impaired recombination in cycling cells; induction of quiescence restored recombination to wild-type levels. Recombination defects were correlated with a cell cycle-dependent defect in the ability of RAG-1 to rescue localization of the RAG-2 mutants. These results suggest that the intrinsic RAG-2 NLS functions in the nuclear uptake of RAG-2 following its reexpression in cycling cells.",

This property and the expression pattern in tissues and cell lines indicate that RAG-1 eitheractivatesorcata- lyres the V(D)J recombination reaction of immuno- globulin and T cell receptor genes. We here describe the introduction of a mutation in RAG-1 into the germ- line of mice via gene targeting in embryonic stem cells. RAG-l-deficient mice have small lymphoid organs that do not contain mature Band T lymphocytes. The arrest of B and T cell differentiation occurs at an early stage and correlates with the inability to perform V(D)J re- combination. The immune system of the RAG-1 mutant mice can be described as that of nonleaky scid mice. Although RAG-1 expression has been reported in the central nervous system of the mouse, no obvious neu- roanatomical or behavioral abnormalities have been found in the RAG-l-deficient mice. Introduction The generation of antibody and Tcell receptor (TCR) diver- sity is mediated to a large extent by the somatic DNA rearrangement known as V(D)J recombination, which joins variable (V), diversity (D), and joining (J) gene seg- ments (Tonegawa, 1983). The genes for the antigen recep- tors are assembled through this process exclusively in lymphocytes. V(D)J recombination occurs at seven differ- ent loci: the immunoglobulin (lg) heavy chain,",

RAG-RSS complex assembly and activity in vitro is promoted by high mobility group proteins of the “HMG-box” family, exemplified by HMGB1. How HMGB1 stimulates the DNA binding and cleavage activity of the RAG complex remains unclear. HMGB1 contains two homologous HMG-box DNA binding domains, termed A and B, linked by a stretch of basic residues to a highly acidic C-terminal tail. To identify determinants of HMGB1 required for stimulation of RAG-mediated RSS binding and cleavage, we prepared an extensive panel of mutant HMGB1 proteins and tested their ability to augment RAG-mediated RSS binding and cleavage activity. Using a combination of mobility shift and in-gel cleavage assays, we find that HMGB1 promotes RAG-mediated cleavage largely through the activity of box B, but optimal stimulation requires a functional A box tethered in the correct orientation. Box A or B mutants fail to promote RAG synaptic complex formation, but this defect is alleviated when the acidic tail is removed from these mutants.",

    "title": "Identification and Characterization of a Gain-of-Function RAG-1 Mutant",
    "abstract": "ABSTRACT RAG-1 and RAG-2 initiate V(D)J recombination by cleaving DNA at recombination signal sequences through sequential nicking and transesterification reactions to yield blunt signal ends and coding ends terminating in a DNA hairpin structure. Ubiquitous DNA repair factors then mediate the rejoining of broken DNA. V(D)J recombination adheres to the 12/23 rule, which limits rearrangement to signal sequences bearing different lengths of DNA (12 or 23 base pairs) between the conserved heptamer and nonamer sequences to which the RAG proteins bind. Both RAG proteins have been subjected to extensive mutagenesis, revealing residues required for one or both cleavage steps or involved in the DNA end-joining process. Gain-of-function RAG mutants remain unidentified. Here, we report a novel RAG-1 mutation, E649A, that supports elevated cleavage activity in vitro by preferentially enhancing hairpin formation. DNA binding activity and the catalysis of other DNA strand transfer reactions, such as transposition, are not substantially affected by the RAG-1 mutation. However, 12/23-regulated synapsis does not strongly stimulate the cleavage activity of a RAG complex containing E649A RAG-1, unlike its wild-type counterpart. Interestingly, wild-type and E649A RAG-1 support similar levels of cleavage and recombination of plasmid substrates containing a 12/23 pair of signal sequences in cell culture; however, E649A RAG-1 supports about threefold more cleavage and recombination than wild-type RAG-1 on 12/12 plasmid substrates. These data suggest that the E649A RAG-1 mutation may interfere with the RAG proteins' ability to sense 12/23-regulated synapsis.",

Despite their success, they also have inherent limitations such as a lack of up-to-date knowledge and hallucination. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a state-of-the-art technique to mitigate those limitations. In particular, given a question, RAG retrieves relevant knowledge from a knowledge database to augment the input of the LLM. For instance, the retrieved knowledge could be a set of top-k texts that are most semantically similar to the given question when the knowledge database contains millions of texts collected from Wikipedia. As a result, the LLM could utilize the retrieved knowledge as the context to generate an answer for the given question. Existing studies mainly focus on improving the accuracy or efficiency of RAG, leaving its security largely unexplored. We aim to bridge the gap in this work. Particularly, we propose PoisonedRAG, a set of knowledge poisoning attacks to RAG, where an attacker could inject a few poisoned texts into the knowledge database such that the LLM generates an attacker-chosen target answer for an attacker-chosen target question. We formulate knowledge poisoning attacks as an optimization problem, whose solution is a set of poisoned texts. Depending on the background knowledge (e.g., black-box and white-box settings) of an attacker on the RAG, we propose two solutions to solve the optimization problem, respectively. Our results on multiple benchmark datasets and LLMs show our attacks could achieve 90% attack success rates when injecting 5 poisoned texts for each target question into a database with millions of texts. We also evaluate recent defenses and our results show they are insufficient to defend against our attacks, highlighting the need for new defenses. 1",

    "title": "Conditional RAG-1 Mutants Block the Hairpin Formation Step of V(D)J Recombination",
    "abstract": "ABSTRACT Hairpin formation serves an important regulatory role in V(D)J recombination because it requires synapsis of an appropriate pair of recombination sites. How hairpin formation is regulated and which regions of the RAG proteins perform this step remain unknown. We analyzed two conditional RAG-1 mutants that affect residues quite close in the primary sequence to an active site amino acid (D600), and we found that they exhibit severely impaired recombination in the presence of certain cleavage site sequences. These mutants are specifically defective for the formation of hairpins, providing the first identification of a region of the V(D)J recombinase necessary for this reaction. Substrates containing mismatched bases at the cleavage site rescued hairpin formation by both mutants, which suggests that the mutations affect the generation of a distorted or unwound DNA intermediate that has been implicated in hairpin formation. Our results also indicate that this region of RAG-1 may be important for coupling hairpin formation to synapsis.",

    "title": "Benchmarking Large Language Models in Retrieval-Augmented Generation",
    "abstract": "Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a promising approach for mitigating the hallucination of large language models (LLMs). However, existing research lacks rigorous evaluation of the impact of retrieval-augmented generation on different large language models, which make it challenging to identify the potential bottlenecks in the capabilities of RAG for different LLMs. In this paper, we systematically investigate the impact of Retrieval-Augmented Generation on large language models. We analyze the performance of different large language models in 4 fundamental abilities required for RAG, including noise robustness, negative rejection, information integration, and counterfactual robustness. To this end, we establish Retrieval-Augmented Generation Benchmark (RGB), a new corpus for RAG evaluation in both English and Chinese. RGB divides the instances within the benchmark into 4 separate testbeds based on the aforementioned fundamental abilities required to resolve the case. Then we evaluate 6 representative LLMs on RGB to diagnose the challenges of current LLMs when applying RAG. Evaluation reveals that while LLMs exhibit a certain degree of noise robustness, they still struggle significantly in terms of negative rejection, information integration, and dealing with false information. The aforementioned assessment outcomes indicate that there is still a considerable journey ahead to effectively apply RAG to LLMs.",

    "abstract": "SCID and RAG‐2 deficient mice were transplanted intraperitoneally with human peripheral blood lymphocytes (hu‐PBL‐SCID and hu‐PBL‐RAG mice). Seven days after transplantation tbe mice were immunized with a pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine. Flow cytometry analysis of cells from the peritoneal cavity and the spleen after 8–10 weeks revealed that human cells had more limited engraftment in RAG than in SCID recipient mice, and that more human cells were found in the spleen than in the peritoneal cavity. Functionality of the human cells recovered from these two locations was explored by the counting of human immunoglobulin secreting cells (hu‐ISC). A total of 83% of the hu‐PBL‐SCID mice and 29% of the hu‐PBL‐RAG mice had detectable hu‐ISC in the peritoneal cavity and/or the spleen. The kinetic profiles of human immunoglobulins in the mouse sera during the experiment showed donor dependency. More than 90% of the hu‐PBL‐SCID mice had detectable levels of human IgG, IgM and IgA, while 78% had detectable levels of IgE, whereas detectable levels of IgG, IgM, IgA and IgE were measured in 37%, 64%, 68% and 23% of the hu‐PBL‐RAG mice, respectively. Forty‐seven per cent of immunized hu‐PBL‐SCID mice showed a human antipneumococcal IgG level that was significantly above the background level in non‐immunized mice, while none of the hu‐PBL‐RAG mice produced any detectable levels of human antipneumococcal IgG. In short, human PBL showed a better engraftment and a better antibody response when transplanted into SCID mice than into RAG mice.",

    "abstract": "V(D)J recombination is initiated by a specialized transposase consisting of RAG-1 and RAG-2. Because full-length RAG proteins are insoluble under physiologic conditions, most previous analyses of RAG activity in vitro have used truncated core RAG-1 and RAG-2 fragments. These studies identified an intermediate in V(D)J recombination, the signal end complex (SEC), in which core RAG proteins remain associated with recombination signal sequences at the cleaved signal ends. From transfected cells expressing affinity-tagged RAG proteins, we have isolated in vivo assembled SECs containing full-length RAG proteins and cleaved recombination substrates. SEC formation in vivo did not require the repair proteins DNA-dependent protein kinase, Ku80, or XRCC4. In the presence of full-length RAG-2, SEC formation in vivo was cell cycle-regulated and restricted to the G0/G1 phases. In contrast, complexes accumulated throughout cell cycle in cells expressing a RAG-2 CDK2 phosphorylation site mutant. Both core and full-length SECs supported transposition in vitro with similar efficiencies. Intracellular SECs, which are likely to persist in the absence of coding ends, represent potential donors whose transposition is not suppressed by the non-core regions of the RAG proteins.",

    "abstract": "Accumulating evidence indicates that peripheral lymphocyte variants with altered antigen receptor expression may be capable of expressing recombination‐activating genes (RAG). We and others recently observed functional RAG gene products in mature T cells with defective TCR expression (MacMahan and Fink, Immunity 1998. 9: 637 – 647; Lantelme et al., J. Immunol., 2000. 164: 3455 – 3459). Here, the association between TCR expression and RAG activity was assessed further in lymphocytes from patients with defective responses to DNA damage. We show that T cells with altered TCR surface expression are present in increased numbers in these patients and that they express RAG genes. The finding of RAG gene expression by TCR variants suggests the possibility that secondary V(D)J rearrangements could be induced in these cells to rescue their defective phenotype and cellular function. Moreover, as V(D)J recombination has been implicated in chromosome translocations involving antigen receptor genes, we discuss a possible relationship between altered TCR expression, RAG activity and the frequent lymphoma‐specific translocations observed in these patients.",

Objective: To investigate RAG expression in the CD5+ or CD5− IgD+ B cell compartment in childhood systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Methods: Using a combination of flow cytometric cell sorting and reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction analysis of cDNA libraries generated from individual cells, the expression of RAG, VpreB, and CD154 mRNA by individual peripheral blood B cells of three paediatric SLE patients was examined in detail. Results: While only one patient had a significantly increased frequency of RAG+ B cells in the CD5− B cell population, all patients showed higher frequencies of RAG+ B cells in the CD5+IgD+ B cell population. The frequency of RAG+ IgD+CD5+/− B cells was reduced during intravenous cyclophosphamide treatment. In healthy age matched children, RAG expressing IgD+ B cells were hardly detectable. Coexpression of RAG and VpreB or CD154 mRNA could only be found in SLE B cells. Conclusions: RAG expression in peripheral blood B cells of SLE patients is particularly increased in the IgD+CD5+ B cell population. CD5+ and CD5− B cells in SLE have the potential to undergo receptor revision leading to the generation of high affinity pathogenic autoantibodies.",

    "title": "Corrective Retrieval Augmented Generation",
    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) inevitably exhibit hallucinations since the accuracy of generated texts cannot be secured solely by the parametric knowledge they encapsulate. Although retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is a practicable complement to LLMs, it relies heavily on the relevance of retrieved documents, raising concerns about how the model behaves if retrieval goes wrong. To this end, we propose the Corrective Retrieval Augmented Generation (CRAG) to improve the robustness of generation. Specifically, a lightweight retrieval evaluator is designed to assess the overall quality of retrieved documents for a query, returning a confidence degree based on which different knowledge retrieval actions can be triggered. Since retrieval from static and limited corpora can only return sub-optimal documents, large-scale web searches are utilized as an extension for augmenting the retrieval results. Besides, a decompose-then-recompose algorithm is designed for retrieved documents to selectively focus on key information and filter out irrelevant information in them. CRAG is plug-and-play and can be seamlessly coupled with various RAG-based approaches. Experiments on four datasets covering short- and long-form generation tasks show that CRAG can significantly improve the performance of RAG-based approaches.",

    "abstract": "The activation and expression of recombination activation genes (RAGs) in lymphoid progenitors are regulated by signals from surface molecules of stromal cells and/or cytokines. Using a mRNA differential display method, we isolated a novel stromal cell-derived cDNA clone, C2.3, whose transcripts were intensively expressed in RAG-1-inducible stromal cell line, but rarely expressed in RAG-1-non inducible mutant cell line (PA6). The cDNA sequence had no homology to the known genes. The sequence revealed an open reading frame that encodes a 221 amino acid protein with 4 potential transmembrane domains, suggesting a possible role of C2.3 product as a membrane receptor. Introduction of C2.3 cDNA into PA6 mutant line restored the ability to activate RAG-1 gene in lymphoid progenitors, indicating that a C2.3 product may be involved in the induction of RAG-1 gene activation.",

    "abstract": "Emulsan, the polyanionic heteropolysaccharide bioemulsifier produced by Acinetobacter calcoaceticus RAG-1, was found to enhance the tolerance of RAG-1 cells to the toxic effects of the cationic detergent cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB). Emulsan-mediated tolerance was obtained with the purified deproteinated apoemulsan; ca. 9 micrograms of apoemulsan neutralized 1 microgram of CTAB. Deesterified apoemulsan was only half as effective in protecting the cells from CTAB toxicity. Tolerance was also mediated by the cell-associated emulsan minicapsule. Mutants lacking this capsule were more sensitive to CTAB than the corresponding parent. The growth of mutants and parent cells in mixed-culture experiments demonstrated that the cell-associated polymer mediates CTAB tolerance in the early stages of growth. Once sufficient cell-free polymer has been released into the aqueous medium (ca. 0.5 micrograms/ml), this extracellular emulsan also plays a role in CTAB tolerance.",

    "abstract": "Products of arachidonic acid metabolism are important for mucosal homeostasis, because blockade of this pathway with an NSAID triggers rapid onset of severe colitis in the IL-10 knockout (IL-10(-/-)) model of IBD. Rag mice do not make T or B cells. This study determined whether reconstitution of Rag mice with T cells from IL-10(-/-) mice transferred NSAID colitis susceptibility. Rag mice were reconstituted by intraperitoneal injection with splenocytes from wild-type (WT) or IL-10(-/-) animals. Colitis was induced by using piroxicam and was graded histologically. Isolated lamina propria mononuclear cells (LPMC), lamina propria T cells, and LPMC depleted of T cells from reconstituted Rag mice were studied for cytokine production. Only animals reconstituted with IL-10(-/-) CD4(+) T cells and administered piroxicam developed severe colitis. LPMC from these colitic animals made IFN-gamma, whose production was dependent on T cells. Some IL-10 was produced but only from non-T cells. LPMC from the healthy Rag mice that were reconstituted with WT T cells and were piroxicam resistant made much more IL-10. This was mostly T cell dependent. In conclusion, only CD4(+) T cells from IL-10(-/-) animals leave Rag mice susceptible to NSAID-induced, Th1 colitis. Lamina propria T cells normally make large quantities of IL-10, suggesting that IL-10 from T cells may be protective.",

    "title": "Mutational analysis of RAG 1 and RAG 2 identifies three catalytic amino acids in RAG 1 critical for both cleavage steps of V ( D ) J recombination",
    "abstract": "RAG1 and RAG2 initiate V(D)J recombination, the process of rearranging the antigen-binding domain of immunoglobulins and T-cell receptors, by introducing site-specific double-strand breaks (DSB) in chromosomal DNA during lymphocyte development. These breaks are generated in two steps, nicking of one strand (hydrolysis), followed by hairpin formation (transesterification). The nature and location of the RAG active site(s) have remained unknown. Because acidic amino acids have a critical role in catalyzing DNA cleavage by nucleases and recombinases that require divalent metal ions as cofactors, we hypothesized that acidic active site residues are likewise essential for RAG-mediated DNA cleavage. We altered each conserved acidic amino acid in RAG1 and RAG2 by site-directed mutagenesis, and examined >100 mutants using a combination of in vivo and in vitro analyses. No conserved acidic amino acids in RAG2 were critical for catalysis; three RAG1 mutants retained normal DNA binding, but were catalytically inactive for both nicking and hairpin formation. These data argue that one active site in RAG1 performs both steps of the cleavage reaction. Amino acid substitution experiments that changed the metal ion specificity suggest that at least one of these three residues contacts the metal ion(s) directly. These data suggest that RAG-mediated DNA cleavage involves coordination of divalent metal ion(s) by RAG1.",

    "abstract": "The establishment of a functional immune system with diverse antigen receptors is dependent on the V(D)J recombination activating gene products Rag-1 and Rag-2. These two proteins constitute the key lymphoid components required for the activation of antigen receptor rearrangement. Both Rag-1 and Rag-2 are required for the catalysis of the initial stages of V(D)J recombination. Thus, functional disruption of either the Rag-1 or Rag-2 genes by homologous recombination, leads to immunodeficiency due to lymphoid arrest at a stage prior to the recombination of the antigen receptor loci. In Rag-deficient mice, both B- and T-cell differentiation is eliminated due to the absence of antigen receptors. Lymphoid development can be restored by the introduction of rearranged antigen receptor transgenes that give rise to monoclonal populations of fully mature B- or T-cells. The absence of the major conventional populations of B- and T-cells from the Rag-deficient mice provided an excellent background for studying the molecular and cellular mechanisms of lymphoid differentiation. The Rag-deficient background has been used as a system for: the functional analysis of Rag-1 and Rag-2; studying the developmental functions of antigen receptors and other molecules of the immune system; the molecular analysis of the early stages of the B- and T-cell lineages; the co-development of lymphocytes with stroma cells; the identification of minor subpopulations of the developing immune system; the involvement of lymphoid populations in the onset of pathogenesis. In addition, the development of the \"blastocyst complementation assay\" methodology, based on the phenotype of the Rag-/- mice, allowed the functional analysis of numerous lymphoid specific components.",

    "abstract": "The recombination activating genes (RAGs) play a critical role in V(D)J recombination machinery and lymphocyte development. Their expression is strictly regulated during lymphocyte ontogeny, with expression being rapidly lost as the lymphoid precursors differentiate into their progeny. To elucidate molecular mechanisms of regulation of human RAG-1 gene expression, we examined a chromatin structure of a approximately 24-kb DNA segment adjacent to a human RAG-1 promoter region in various cell lines by analyzing DNase I hypersensitive (DNase I HS) sites. In a RAG-1-expressing human pre-B-cell line, at least four DNase I HS sites (HS1, HS2, HS3, and HS4) were identified. Among these HS sites, one HS site (HS1) was ubiquitously detected in all cell lines examined, but the other three HS sites (HS2, HS3, and HS4) were associated only with RAG-1-expressing lymphoid cell lines. Using transient expression assays, we showed that the 5' upstream region of the major transcription start site showed low but significant promoter activity and that a DNA segment within HS3 located in the promoter region was indispensable to its basal promoter activity. Importantly, this promoter region was shown to be active in both RAG-1-expressing and RAG-1-nonexpressing cell lines. These results suggest that alteration of chromatin structure in the promoter region, in addition to other control elements outside of the promoter region, is one of the mechanisms regulating tissue- and stage-specific expression of human RAG-1 gene.",

    "title": "RAG-1 and RAG-2-dependent assembly of functional complexes with V(D)J recombination substrates in solution",
    "abstract": "V(D)J recombination is initiated by RAG-1 and RAG-2, which introduce double-strand DNA breaks at recombination signal sequences (RSSs) of antigen receptor gene segments to produce signal ends, terminating in blunt, double-strand breaks, and coding ends, terminating in DNA hairpins. While the formation of RAG-RSS complexes has been documented, observations regarding the individual contributions of RAG-1 and RAG-2 to RSS recognition are in conflict. Here we describe an assay for formation and maintenance of functional RAG-RSS complexes in the course of the DNA cleavage reaction. Under conditions of in vitro cleavage, the RAG proteins sequester intact substrate DNA in a stable complex which is formed prior to strand scission. The cleavage reaction subsequently proceeds through nicking and hairpin formation without dissociation of substrate. Notably, the presence of both RAG-1 and RAG-2 is essential for formation of stable, functional complexes with substrate DNA under conditions of the sequestration assay. Two classes of substrate mutation are distinguished by their effects on RAG-mediated DNA cleavage in vitro. A mutation of the first class, residing within the RSS nonamer and associated with coordinate impairment of nicking and hairpin formation, greatly reduces the stability of RAG association with intact substrate DNA. In contrast, a mutation of the second class, lying within the RSS heptamer and associated with selective abolition of hairpin formation, has little or no effect on the half-life of the RAG-substrate complex.",

The mechanisms regulating RAG expression and repression are not clear.

We also show that in all other cells NWC is controlled by the RAG2 intragenic promoter, which in immature and mature T and B lymphocytes is silent. The possible implications of these findings for understanding the activation and inactivation of RAG genes in lymphocytes and their repression in other cells are discussed.",

    "abstract": "The garment industry is one of the world's largest industries, yet there are few sustained examinations of its importance to the global economy and the very vital role that immigrant entrepreneurship has played. Focusing on the garment industry in seven world cities -Paris, London, Birmingham, Amsterdam, New York, Miami and Los Angeles- this book tackles the complex relationship between the development of immigrant entrepreneurship and the shift to global, post-industrial urban economies. The interconnections among immigrant entrepreneurs, social networks, market conditions and regulatory matters are thoroughly explored in a comparative way. Starting from the idea that general social, economic and political processes manifest themselves in ever changing, historically specific shapes, the contributors offer intriguing insights into the dynamics of entrepreneurial management against the backdrop of such processes as: the differential spatial impact of economic restructuring; the significance of governance at various levels; and the conditional use of social capital. With contributions from leading experts in the field, this is a must for those wishing to supplement their knowledge in globalization, labour, economics, immigration and the garment industry broadly speaking.",

The mechanism requires precise cutting of the DNA at segment boundaries followed by rejoining of particular pairs of the resulting termini. The imprecision of aspects of the joining reaction contributes significantly to increasing the variability of the resulting functional genes. Signal sequences target DNA recombination and must participate in a highly ordered protein-DNA complex in order to limit recombination to appropriate partners. Two proteins, RAG1 and RAG2, together form the nuclease that cleaves the DNA at the border of the signal sequences. Additional roles of these proteins in organizing the reaction complex for subsequent steps are explored.",

    "abstract": "RAG1 and RAG2 play a central role in V(D)J recombination, a process for antigen receptor gene assembly. The truncated 'core' regions of RAGs are sufficient to catalyze the recombination reaction, although with lower joining efficiency than full-length proteins. To investigate the role of the non-core regions of RAGs in the end-joining phase of antigen receptor rearrangement, we analyzed recombination products isolated from core RAG1 and core RAG2 knock-in mice. Here, we report that the truncation of RAGs increases the frequency of aberrant recombination in vivo. Signal joints (SJs) associated with V-to-D recombination of core RAG1 knock-in mice were normal, whereas those of core RAG2 knock-in mice were highly imprecise, containing large deletions and additions, and in some cases coding sequences. In contrast, we found an elevated level of imprecise D-to-J associated SJs for both core RAG1- and RAG2-expressing mice. Likewise, sequences of coding joints (CJs) were also affected by the expression of core RAGs. Finally, sequences found at the junctions of rearranged T-cell receptor loci were highly influenced by differences in rearranging recombination signal sequence pairs. We provide the first evidence that the non-core regions of RAGs have critical functions in the proper assembly and resolution of recombination intermediates in endogenous antigen receptor loci.",

    "title": "Recombination activating genes (RAG) induce secondary Ig gene rearrangement in and subsequent apoptosis of human peripheral blood circulating B lymphocytes",
    "abstract": "Recombination activating gene (RAG) re‐expression and secondary Ig gene rearrangement in mature B lymphocytes have been reported. Here, we have studied RAG expression of peripheral blood B lymphocytes in humans. Normal B cells did not express RAG1 and RAG2 spontaneously. More than a half of circulating B cells expressed RAG proteins, when activated with Staphylococcus aureus Cowan I (SAC) + IL‐2. DNA binding activity of the RAG complex has been verified by a gel shift assay employing the recombination signal sequence (RSS). Secondary Ig light chain rearrangement in the RAG‐expressing B cells was confirmed by linker‐mediated (LM)‐PCR. Highly purified surface κ+ B cells activated by SAC + IL‐2 became RAG+, and thereafter they started to express λ chain mRNA. 2 colour immunofluorescence analysis disclosed that a part of the RAG+ cells derived from the purified κ+ B cells activated by SAC + IL‐2 turned to λ+ phenotype in vitro. Similarly, apoptosis induction was observed in a part of the RAG+ B cells. Our study suggests that a majority of peripheral blood B cells re‐expresses RAG and the RAG+ B lymphocytes could be eliminated from the B cell repertoire either by changing Ag receptor specificity due to secondary rearrangement or by apoptosis induction. Thus, RAG expression of mature B cells in peripheral blood would contribute to not only receptor revision for further diversification of B cell repertoire but in some cases (or in some B cell subsets) to prevention or induction of autoAb responses at this differentiation stage in humans.",

    "abstract": "We introduce RAGAs (Retrieval Augmented Generation Assessment), a framework for reference-free evaluation of Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines. RAGAs is available at [https://github.com/explodinggradients/ragas]. RAG systems are composed of a retrieval and an LLM based generation module. They provide LLMs with knowledge from a reference textual database, enabling them to act as a natural language layer between a user and textual databases, thus reducing the risk of hallucinations. Evaluating RAG architectures is challenging due to several dimensions to consider: the ability of the retrieval system to identify relevant and focused context passages, the ability of the LLM to exploit such passages faithfully, and the quality of the generation itself. With RAGAs, we introduce a suite of metrics that can evaluate these different dimensions without relying on ground truth human annotations. We posit that such a framework can contribute crucially to faster evaluation cycles of RAG architectures, which is especially important given the fast adoption of LLMs.",

    "abstract": "Dilated cardiomyopathy is a severe pathology of the heart with poorly understood etiology. Disruption of the gene encoding the negative immunoregulatory receptor PD-1 in BALB/c mice, but not in BALB/c RAG-2-/- mice, caused dilated cardiomyopathy with severely impaired contraction and sudden death by congestive heart failure. Affected hearts showed diffuse deposition of immunoglobulin G (IgG) on the surface of cardiomyocytes. All of the affected PD-1-/- mice exhibited high-titer circulating IgG autoantibodies reactive to a 33-kilodalton protein expressed specifically on the surface of cardiomyocytes. These results indicate that PD-1 may be an important factor contributing to the prevention of autoimmune diseases.",

    "abstract": "Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has recently gained traction in natural language processing. Numerous studies and real-world applications are leveraging its ability to enhance generative models through external information retrieval. Evaluating these RAG systems, however, poses unique challenges due to their hybrid structure and reliance on dynamic knowledge sources. To better understand these challenges, we conduct A Unified Evaluation Process of RAG (Auepora) and aim to provide a comprehensive overview of the evaluation and benchmarks of RAG systems. Specifically, we examine and compare several quantifiable metrics of the Retrieval and Generation components, such as relevance, accuracy, and faithfulness, within the current RAG benchmarks, encompassing the possible output and ground truth pairs. We then analyze the various datasets and metrics, discuss the limitations of current benchmarks, and suggest potential directions to advance the field of RAG benchmarks.",

    "abstract": "The differentiation status of Sternberg-Reed (SR) cells is still not well defined, primarily because of their scarcity in tumor biopsies of Hodgkin's disease (HD). In this study we have determined the genomic differentiation status of SR cells by quantitation of recombinase activating gene (RAG) expression. RAG genes are selectively transcribed in immature lymphoid cells. In B cells they are silent after genomic rearrangement has occurred, whereas in T cells they are downregulated during positive selection of double-positive thymocytes into single-positive cells. RNA from tumor biopsies either with numerous (11 cases) or a with few SR cells (16 cases) was assessed by a sensitive reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and the results compared with established positive and negative controls. In all except two cases levels of RAG expression were within the range of those determined in negative controls. In both positive cases and in the positive control RAG mRNA was further quantitated by competitive PCR. In cases with abundant SR cells RAG expression was still below that observed in 10(-2) dilutions of positive controls. These results suggest that SR cells are derived from lymphoid cells, more differentiated than the pre-B or common thymocyte stage, which have already undergone genomic rearrangement. They show the value of assessing RAG expression by RT-PCR in the characterization of lymphoid malignancies.",

    "title": "Differential regulation of mTORC1 by leucine and glutamine",
    "abstract": "Getting specific about amino acid sensing The protein kinase complex mTORC1 regulates growth and metabolism, and its activity is controlled in response to the abundance of cellular amino acids. Jewell et al. report that control of mTORC1 in response to glutamine does not require the Rag guanosine triphosphatase (GTPase) implicated in the sensing of other amino acids such as leucine (see the Perspective by Abraham). For sensing of glutamine, another GTPase, Arf1, was required. Distinct mechanisms thus appear to couple various amino acids to signaling by the mTORC1 complex. Science, this issue p. 194; see also p. 128 Distinct mechanisms sense amino acids leucine and glutamine at the lysosome. [Also see Perspective by Abraham] The mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) complex 1 (mTORC1) integrates environmental and intracellular signals to regulate cell growth. Amino acids stimulate mTORC1 activation at the lysosome in a manner thought to be dependent on the Rag small guanosine triphosphatases (GTPases), the Ragulator complex, and the vacuolar H+–adenosine triphosphatase (v-ATPase). We report that leucine and glutamine stimulate mTORC1 by Rag GTPase-dependent and -independent mechanisms, respectively. Glutamine promoted mTORC1 translocation to the lysosome in RagA and RagB knockout cells and required the v-ATPase but not the Ragulator. Furthermore, we identified the adenosine diphosphate ribosylation factor–1 GTPase to be required for mTORC1 activation and lysosomal localization by glutamine. Our results uncover a signaling cascade to mTORC1 activation independent of the Rag GTPases and suggest that mTORC1 is differentially regulated by specific amino acids.",

    "title": "Irradiation Promotes V(D)J Joining and RAG-Dependent Neoplastic Transformation in SCID T-Cell Precursors",
    "abstract": "ABSTRACT Defects in the nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ) pathway of double-stranded DNA break repair severely impair V(D)J joining and selectively predispose mice to the development of lymphoid neoplasia. This connection was first noted in mice with the severe combined immune deficient (SCID) mutation in the DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK). SCID mice spontaneously develop thymic lymphoma with low incidence and long latency. However, we and others showed that low-dose irradiation of SCID mice dramatically increases the frequency and decreases the latency of thymic lymphomagenesis, but irradiation does not promote the development of other tumors. We have used this model to explore the mechanistic basis by which defects in NHEJ confer selective and profound susceptibility to lymphoid oncogenesis. Here, we show that radiation quantitatively and qualitatively improves V(D)J joining in SCID cells, in the absence of T-cell receptor-mediated cellular selection. Furthermore, we show that the lymphocyte-specific endonuclease encoded by the recombinase-activating genes (RAG-1 and RAG-2) is required for radiation-induced thymic lymphomagenesis in SCID mice. Collectively, these data suggest that irradiation induces a DNA-PK-independent NHEJ pathway that facilitates V(D)J joining, but also promotes oncogenic misjoining of RAG-1/2-induced breaks in SCID T-cell precursors.",

In particular, the history of one domestic craft, rag rug making, is explored in its relation to the development of the textile industries and paper manufacture, from the end of the 18th century onwards. The strange absence of the rag rug from Elizabeth Gaskell's indus trial novel Mary Barton (1848) is scrutinized, in order to further explore the representation of working-class life, in literature and history: by social investigators and novelists in the past, and by modern historians. Questions are then raised about the uses to which these representations and accounts have been put, in a modern class society.",

Expression of RAG-1 and RAG-2 by thymocytes is normally limited to cells that have not completed selection. We have previously documented that persistent expression of the recombinase activating genes (RAG) in transgenic mice results in aberrant thymic development, altered lymphatic microanatomy, and a profound immunodeficiency. Here we further document the pathologic changes found in TG.RAG-1,2 mice and examine the role of TCR recombination and positive and negative thymic selection, as well as allelic exclusion, in the etiology of the phenotype. We find that neither selection nor TCR allelic exclusion can be overcome by transgenic expression RAG-1 and RAG-2 under the control of an lck promoter.",

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) encapsulate a vast amount of factual information within their pre-trained weights, as evidenced by their ability to answer diverse questions across different domains. However, this knowledge is inherently limited, relying heavily on the characteristics of the training data. Consequently, using external datasets to incorporate new information or refine the capabilities of LLMs on previously seen information poses a significant challenge. In this study, we compare two common approaches: unsupervised fine-tuning and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). We evaluate both approaches on a variety of knowledge-intensive tasks across different topics. Our findings reveal that while unsupervised fine-tuning offers some improvement, RAG consistently outperforms it, both for existing knowledge encountered during training and entirely new knowledge. Moreover, we find that LLMs struggle to learn new factual information through unsupervised fine-tuning, and that exposing them to numerous variations of the same fact during training could alleviate this problem.",

    "title": "Immunoglobulin gene hypermutation in germinal centers is independent of the RAG‐1 V(D)J recombinase",
    "abstract": "Summary: Antigen‐driven somatic hypermutation in immunoglobulin genes coupled with stringent selection leads to affinity maturation in the B‐lymphocyte populations present in germinal centers. To date, no gene(s) has been identified that drives the hypermutation process. The site‐specific recombination of antigen‐receptor gene segments in T and B lymphocytes is dependent on the expression of two recombination activating genes, RAG‐1 and RAG‐2, The RAG‐1 and RAG‐2 proteins are essential for the cleavage of DNA at highly conserved recombination signals to make double‐strand breaks and their expression is sufficient to confer V(D)J recombination activity to non‐lymphoid cells. Until very recently, expression of the V(D)J recombinase in adults was believed to be restricted to sites of primary lymphogenesis. However, several laboratories have now demonstrated expression of RAG‐1 and RAG‐2 and active V‐to‐(D)J recombination in germinal center B cells. This observation of active recombinase in germinal centers raises the issue of RAG‐mediated nuclease activity as a component of V(D)J hypermutation. Here, we show that a tratisgenic K‐light chain gene in a RAG‐1‐/‐ genetic background can acquire high frequencies of mutations. Thus, the RAG‐1 protein is not essential for the machinery of immunoglobulin hypermutation. The genetic approaches to identifying the genes necessary for sotnatic hypermutation will require further studies on DNA‐repair and immunodeficient models.",

    "title": "Evaluating Retrieval Quality in Retrieval-Augmented Generation",
    "abstract": "Evaluating retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) presents challenges, particularly for retrieval models within these systems. Traditional end-to-end evaluation methods are computationally expensive. Furthermore, evaluation of the retrieval model's performance based on query-document relevance labels shows a small correlation with the RAG system's downstream performance. We propose a novel evaluation approach, eRAG, where each document in the retrieval list is individually utilized by the large language model within the RAG system. The output generated for each document is then evaluated based on the downstream task ground truth labels. In this manner, the downstream performance for each document serves as its relevance label. We employ various downstream task metrics to obtain document-level annotations and aggregate them using set-based or ranking metrics. Extensive experiments on a wide range of datasets demonstrate that eRAG achieves a higher correlation with downstream RAG performance compared to baseline methods, with improvements in Kendall's $\\tau$ correlation ranging from 0.168 to 0.494. Additionally, eRAG offers significant computational advantages, improving runtime and consuming up to 50 times less GPU memory than end-to-end evaluation.",

All the three probands had RAG 1 mutations in both alleles, at least one of which was a missense substitution. Of the three fetuses tested, one had a wild type sequence on both alleles, while the other two had one mutated allele. None of the three patients were predicted to be affected and this was confirmed at birth. Detection of RAG genes mutations on fetal samples by direct sequencing is an easy and effective way to investigate fetuses from families affected with RAG‐dependent SCID and OS families affected by RAG‐dependent SCID and OS.

    "title": "RankRAG: Unifying Context Ranking with Retrieval-Augmented Generation in LLMs",
    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) typically utilize the top-k contexts from a retriever in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). In this work, we propose a novel instruction fine-tuning framework RankRAG, which instruction-tunes a single LLM for the dual purpose of context ranking and answer generation in RAG. In particular, the instruction-tuned LLMs work surprisingly well by adding a small fraction of ranking data into the training blend, and outperform existing expert ranking models, including the same LLM exclusively fine-tuned on a large amount of ranking data. For generation, we compare our model with many strong baselines, including GPT-4-0613, GPT-4-turbo-2024-0409, and ChatQA-1.5, an open-sourced model with the state-of-the-art performance on RAG benchmarks. Specifically, our Llama3-RankRAG significantly outperforms Llama3-ChatQA-1.5 and GPT-4 models on nine knowledge-intensive benchmarks. In addition, it also performs comparably to GPT-4 on five RAG benchmarks in the biomedical domain without instruction fine-tuning on biomedical data, demonstrating its superb capability for generalization to new domains.",

    "title": "A simple technique for generating probes for RNA in situ hybridization: an adjunct to genome mapping exemplified by the RAG-1/RAG-2 gene cluster.",
    "abstract": "Two major problems have to be solved in studies of genes near breakpoints of chromosome abnormalities and in large-scale genomic mapping projects: (i) the identification of genes within the large amount on nontranscribed DNA and (ii) the determination of the tissues in which the identified genes are transcribed. In situ hybridization to mRNA is ideally suited to assess gene expression in all tissues but probe preparation presents major difficulties for adapting the technique for rapid screening. Here, we present a procedure to easily generate strand-specific DNA probes for in situ hybridization. In this method, a DNA fragment to be tested in uniformly labeled, denatured, and prehybridized to an excess of competitor single-stranded DNA corresponding to either positive or negative strands of the test fragment. No sequence information is needed. The prehybridized mixture is used directly for hybridization to whole embryo or tissue sections. We demonstrate the utility of this approach for any nonrepetitive fragment by using cDNA probes, intronless genomic probes, or genomic probes comprising transcribed and nontranscribed DNA. As an example, we show that mRNA for the recombination-activating genes (RAG) RAG-1 and RAG-2 is found in thymus of dE16 mouse embryos. Within the thymus, high levels of expression of RAG-1 and RAG-2 are detectable in the cortex but not in the medullary region. This supports the view that RAG-1 and RAG-2 expression is associated with cells known to actively rearrange antigen receptor loci.",

We introduce ARES, an Automated RAG Evaluation System, for evaluating RAG systems along the dimensions of context relevance, answer faithfulness, and answer relevance. By creating its own synthetic training data, ARES finetunes lightweight LM judges to assess the quality of individual RAG components. To mitigate potential prediction errors, ARES utilizes a small set of human-annotated datapoints for prediction-powered inference (PPI). Across eight different knowledge-intensive tasks in KILT, SuperGLUE, and AIS, ARES accurately evaluates RAG systems while using only a few hundred human annotations during evaluation. Furthermore, ARES judges remain effective across domain shifts, proving accurate even after changing the type of queries and/or documents used in the evaluated RAG systems. We make our code and datasets publicly available on Github.",

    "title": "Recombination activating gene-1 (RAG-1) expression in all differentiation stages of B-lineage precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia.",
    "abstract": "The recombination activating gene-1 (RAG-1), which is required for immunoglobulin (Ig) gene rearrangement, is expressed in murine B-lymphoid precursors but not in mature B lymphocytes. In order to characterize the temporal relationship of RAG-1 expression to other markers of human B-lymphoid differentiation [cell surface antigens, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT), Ig gene rearrangements], RAG-1 expression was studied in a group of B lineage childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). ALL cells from 21 patients were grouped into three developmentally related phenotypes based on the expression of the differentiation antigens CD19, CD10, and CD20. All 21 leukemias were surface Ig (slg) negative. There were leukemias representing each developmental stage of Ig gene rearrangement. RAG-1 was expressed in 20 of 21 B-lineage ALL, including leukemic cells from each stage of differentiation, as defined by immunophenotype and IgH and IgL gene rearrangement status. RAG-1 was expressed in slg- ALL, regardless of the Ig heavy chain (IgH) or Ig light chain (IgL) gene configuration. RAG-1 was not expressed in two Burkitt lymphomas and Burkitt lymphoma cell lines with slg+ mature B-lymphocyte phenotype. In two cases, RAG-1 was expressed in TdT-negative ALL; conversely TdT was expressed in the one RAG-1 negative ALL. These results suggest that RAG-1 in B-lineage ALL is expressed at all phenotypic and genotypic developmental stages preceding surface immunoglobulin expression, and that TdT and RAG-1 may be regulated by different mechanisms.",

    "title": "Regulation of RAG-2 protein expression in avian thymocytes",
    "abstract": "The recombinase-activating genes, RAG-1 and RAG-2, have been shown to be necessary to initiate the process of V(D)J recombination during the ontogeny of lymphocytes. While much is known about the end products of this rearrangement process, little is known about the function or regulation of the components of the recombinase system. To this end, we have generated a monoclonal antibody to the chicken RAG-2 protein. Chicken thymocytes were found to express high levels of RAG-2, part of which is phosphorylated. Within thymocytes, RAG-2 is expressed primarily within the nucleus. RAG-2 protein levels are high in the CD4- CD8- and CD4+ CD8+ immature thymocytes but absent at the single-positive CD4+ CD8- or CD4- CD8+ stage of thymocyte development. Mitogenic stimulation of thymocytes with phorbol myristate acetate and ionomycin results in down-regulation of RAG-2 expression. Consistent with these data, in vivo levels of RAG-2 are markedly lower in proliferating thymocytes than in smaller, G0/G1 cells. Down-regulation of RAG-2 expression appears to occur before cells enter S phase, suggesting that RAG-2 function may be limited to noncycling cells.",

    "abstract": "Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has shown significant improvements in various natural language processing tasks by integrating the strengths of large language models (LLMs) and external knowledge databases. However, RAG introduces long sequence generation and leads to high computation and memory costs. We propose RAGCache, a novel multilevel dynamic caching system tailored for RAG. Our analysis benchmarks current RAG systems, pinpointing the performance bottleneck (i.e., long sequence due to knowledge injection) and optimization opportunities (i.e., caching knowledge's intermediate states). Based on these insights, we design RAGCache, which organizes the intermediate states of retrieved knowledge in a knowledge tree and caches them in the GPU and host memory hierarchy. RAGCache proposes a replacement policy that is aware of LLM inference characteristics and RAG retrieval patterns. It also dynamically overlaps the retrieval and inference steps to minimize the end-to-end latency. We implement RAGCache and evaluate it on vLLM, a state-of-the-art LLM inference system and Faiss, a state-of-the-art vector database. The experimental results show that RAGCache reduces the time to first token (TTFT) by up to 4x and improves the throughput by up to 2.1x compared to vLLM integrated with Faiss.",

This methodology, focusing primarily on the text domain, provides a cost-effective solution to the generation of plausible but possibly incorrect responses by LLMs, thereby enhancing the accuracy and reliability of their outputs through the use of real-world data. As RAG grows in complexity and incorporates multiple concepts that can influence its performance, this paper organizes the RAG paradigm into four categories: pre-retrieval, retrieval, post-retrieval, and generation, offering a detailed perspective from the retrieval viewpoint. It outlines RAG's evolution and discusses the field's progression through the analysis of significant studies. Additionally, the paper introduces evaluation methods for RAG, addressing the challenges faced and proposing future research directions. By offering an organized framework and categorization, the study aims to consolidate existing research on RAG, clarify its technological underpinnings, and highlight its potential to broaden the adaptability and applications of LLMs.",

    "title": "Restricted expression of recombination activating gene (RAG‐1) in mouse lymphoid tissues",
    "abstract": "In an attempt to determine the distribution of recombinase activity in the mouse thymus, spleen and lymph nodes, we used the in situ hybridization method to examine the expression of the recombination activating genes RAG‐1 and RAG‐2. Expression of RAG‐1 was found in most cortical thymocytes but not in the majority of medullary thymocytes. Although hybridization signals of RAG‐2 were not as intense as those of RAG‐1, the localization of RAG‐2 transcripts was similar to that of RAG‐1. In the spleen, expression of RAG‐1 was found only in limited cells near the sinus, and the majority of the cells within the follicle were negative for RAG‐1 transcript. In nude mice, RAG‐1‐expressing cells were detected in the same regions, which suggests that in situ hybridization signals of RAG‐1 in the spleen are due to the cells of B cell origin. In the lymph nodes, expression of RAG‐1 was found only in the medullary region. Expression of RAG‐2 transcript in the spleen and the lymph nodes, if any, was too faint to determine the specific localization. These results suggest that most of the cortical thymocytes and some cells in the spleen are capable of rearranging T cell receptor genes and immunoglobulin genes, respectively, but the possibility of some other explanation could not be ruled out in RAG‐1 expressing cells of the spleen and the lymph nodes.",

    "title": "FlashRAG: A Modular Toolkit for Efficient Retrieval-Augmented Generation Research",
    "abstract": "With the advent of Large Language Models (LLMs), the potential of Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques have garnered considerable research attention. Numerous novel algorithms and models have been introduced to enhance various aspects of RAG systems. However, the absence of a standardized framework for implementation, coupled with the inherently intricate RAG process, makes it challenging and time-consuming for researchers to compare and evaluate these approaches in a consistent environment. Existing RAG toolkits like LangChain and LlamaIndex, while available, are often heavy and unwieldy, failing to meet the personalized needs of researchers. In response to this challenge, we propose FlashRAG, an efficient and modular open-source toolkit designed to assist researchers in reproducing existing RAG methods and in developing their own RAG algorithms within a unified framework. Our toolkit implements 12 advanced RAG methods and has gathered and organized 32 benchmark datasets. Our toolkit has various features, including customizable modular framework, rich collection of pre-implemented RAG works, comprehensive datasets, efficient auxiliary pre-processing scripts, and extensive and standard evaluation metrics. Our toolkit and resources are available at https://github.com/RUC-NLPIR/FlashRAG.",

    "title": "RAGTruth: A Hallucination Corpus for Developing Trustworthy Retrieval-Augmented Language Models",
    "abstract": "Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has become a main technique for alleviating hallucinations in large language models (LLMs). Despite the integration of RAG, LLMs may still present unsupported or contradictory claims to the retrieved contents. In order to develop effective hallucination prevention strategies under RAG, it is important to create benchmark datasets that can measure the extent of hallucination. This paper presents RAGTruth, a corpus tailored for analyzing word-level hallucinations in various domains and tasks within the standard RAG frameworks for LLM applications. RAGTruth comprises nearly 18,000 naturally generated responses from diverse LLMs using RAG. These responses have undergone meticulous manual annotations at both the individual cases and word levels, incorporating evaluations of hallucination intensity. We not only benchmark hallucination frequencies across different LLMs, but also critically assess the effectiveness of several existing hallucination detection methodologies. Furthermore, we show that using a high-quality dataset such as RAGTruth, it is possible to finetune a relatively small LLM and achieve a competitive level of performance in hallucination detection when compared to the existing prompt-based approaches using state-of-the-art large language models such as GPT-4.",

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) generalize well across language tasks, but suffer from hallucinations and uninterpretability, making it difficult to assess their accuracy without ground-truth. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) models have been proposed to reduce hallucinations and provide provenance for how an answer was generated. Applying such models to the scientific literature may enable large-scale, systematic processing of scientific knowledge. We present PaperQA, a RAG agent for answering questions over the scientific literature. PaperQA is an agent that performs information retrieval across full-text scientific articles, assesses the relevance of sources and passages, and uses RAG to provide answers. Viewing this agent as a question answering model, we find it exceeds performance of existing LLMs and LLM agents on current science QA benchmarks. To push the field closer to how humans perform research on scientific literature, we also introduce LitQA, a more complex benchmark that requires retrieval and synthesis of information from full-text scientific papers across the literature. Finally, we demonstrate PaperQA's matches expert human researchers on LitQA.",

Urbanization contributes enhanced municipal solid waste (MSW) generation and unscientific handling of MSW degrades the urban environment and causes health hazards. In this paper, an attempt is made to evaluate the major parameters of MSWM, in addition to a comprehensive review of MSW generation, its characterization, collection, and treatment options as practiced in India. The current status of MSWM in Indian states and important cities of India is also reported. The essential conditions for harnessing optimal benefits from the possibilities for public private partnership and challenges thereof and unnoticeable role of rag-pickers are also discussed. The study concludes that installation of decentralized solid waste processing units in metropolitan cities/towns and development of formal recycling industry sector is the need of the hour in developing countries like India.",

    "abstract": "alpha-Galactosylceramide (alpha-GalCer) is a glycolipid with potent antitumor properties that binds to CD1d molecules and activates mouse Valpha14 and human Valpha24 NKT cells. Surprisingly, we found that, as early as 90 min after alpha-GalCer injection in vivo, NK cells also displayed considerable signs of activation, including IFN-gamma production and CD69 induction. NK activation was not observed in RAG- or CD1-deficient mice, and it was decreased by pretreatment with anti-IFN-gamma Abs, suggesting that, despite its rapid induction, it was a secondary event that depended on IFN-gamma release by NKT cells. At later time points, B cells and CD8 T cells also began to express CD69. These findings identify a high-speed communication network between the innate and adaptive immune systems in vivo that is initiated upon NKT cell activation. They also suggest that the antitumor effects of alpha-GalCer result from the sequential recruitment of distinct innate and adaptive effector lymphocytes.",

    "title": "Retrieval-augmented Generation to Improve Math Question-Answering: Trade-offs Between Groundedness and Human Preference",
    "abstract": "For middle-school math students, interactive question-answering (QA) with tutors is an effective way to learn. The flexibility and emergent capabilities of generative large language models (LLMs) has led to a surge of interest in automating portions of the tutoring process - including interactive QA to support conceptual discussion of mathematical concepts. However, LLM responses to math questions can be incorrect or mismatched to the educational context - such as being misaligned with a school's curriculum. One potential solution is retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), which involves incorporating a vetted external knowledge source in the LLM prompt to increase response quality. In this paper, we designed prompts that retrieve and use content from a high-quality open-source math textbook to generate responses to real student questions. We evaluate the efficacy of this RAG system for middle-school algebra and geometry QA by administering a multi-condition survey, finding that humans prefer responses generated using RAG, but not when responses are too grounded in the textbook content. We argue that while RAG is able to improve response quality, designers of math QA systems must consider trade-offs between generating responses preferred by students and responses closely matched to specific educational resources.",

    "abstract": "A cellular compartment allows simultaneous protein synthesis and degradation. Protein synthesis and autophagic degradation are regulated in an opposite manner by mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), whereas under certain conditions it would be beneficial if they occurred in unison to handle rapid protein turnover. We observed a distinct cellular compartment at the trans side of the Golgi apparatus, the TOR-autophagy spatial coupling compartment (TASCC), where (auto)lysosomes and mTOR accumulated during Ras-induced senescence. mTOR recruitment to the TASCC was amino acid– and Rag guanosine triphosphatase–dependent, and disruption of mTOR localization to the TASCC suppressed interleukin-6/8 synthesis. TASCC formation was observed during macrophage differentiation and in glomerular podocytes; both displayed increased protein secretion. The spatial coupling of cells’ catabolic and anabolic machinery could augment their respective functions and facilitate the mass synthesis of secretory proteins.",

    "abstract": "Detection of differentially regulated genes has been severely hampered by technical limitations. In an effort to overcome these problems, the PCR-coupled subtractive process of representational difference analysis (RDA) [Lisitsyn, N. et al. (1993) Science 259, 946-951] has been adapted for use with cDNA. In a model system, RAG-1 and RAG-2, the genes responsible for activating V(D)J recombination, were identified in a genomic transfectant by cDNA RDA in a small fraction of the time taken by conventional means. The system was also modified to eliminate expected difference products to facilitate the identification of novel genes. Additional alterations to the conditions allowed isolation of differentially expressed fragments. Several caffeine up-regulated clones were obtained from the pre-B cell line 1-8, including IGF-1B, and a predicted homologue of the natural killer cell antigen, NKR-P1. The approach was found to be fast, extremely sensitive, reproducible, and predominantly lacked false positives. cDNA RDA has the capacity and adaptability to be applied to a wide range of biological problems, including the study of single gene disorders, characterization of mutant and complemented cell types, developmental or post-event expression time courses, and examination of pathogen-host interactions.",

    "abstract": "CD4+CD25+ regulatory T (TR) cells can inhibit a variety of autoimmune and inflammatory diseases, but the precise mechanisms by which they suppress immune responses in vivo remain unresolved. Here, we have used Helicobacter hepaticus infection of T cell–reconstituted recombination-activating gene (RAG)−/− mice as a model to study the ability of CD4+CD25+ TR cells to inhibit bacterially triggered intestinal inflammation. H. hepaticus infection elicited both T cell-mediated and T cell–independent intestinal inflammation, both of which were inhibited by adoptively transferred CD4+CD25+ TR cells. T cell–independent pathology was accompanied by activation of the innate immune system that was also inhibited by CD4+CD25+ TR cells. Suppression of innate immune pathology was dependent on T cell–derived interleukin 10 and also on the production of transforming growth factor β. Thus, CD4+CD25+ TR cells do not only suppress adaptive T cell responses, but are also able to control pathology mediated by innate immune mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "Citrobacter rodentium is a gastrointestinal infection that requires early IL-22 from group 3 innate lymphoid cells (ILC3) for resistance. The role of vitamin D in the clearance of C. rodentium infection was tested in vitamin D sufficient (D+) and vitamin D deficient (D-) wildtype (WT) and Cyp27B1 (Cyp) KO mice (unable to produce the high affinity vitamin D ligand 1,25(OH)2D, 1,25D). Feeding Cyp KO mice D- diets reduced vitamin D levels and prevented synthesis of 1,25D. D- (WT and Cyp KO) mice had fewer ILC3 cells and less IL-22 than D+ mice. D- Cyp KO mice developed a severe infection that resulted in the lethality of the mice by d14 post-infection. T and B cell deficient D- Rag KO mice also developed a severe and lethal infection with C. rodentium compared to D+ Rag KO mice. D- WT mice survived the infection but took significantly longer to clear the C. rodentium infection than D+ WT or D+ Cyp KO mice. Treating infected D- Cyp KO mice with IL-22 protected the mice from lethality. Treating the D- WT mice with 1,25D reconstituted the ILC3 cells in the colon and protected the mice from C. rodentium. IL-22 treatment of D- WT mice eliminated the need for vitamin D to clear the C. rodentium infection. Vitamin D is required for early IL-22 production from ILC3 cells and protection from enteric infection with C. rodentium.",

    "abstract": "The dominant lymphocytes in human and murine implantation sites are transient, pregnancy-associated uterine natural killer (uNK) cells. These cells are a major source of interferon (IFN)-γ. Implantation sites in mice lacking uNK cells (alymphoid recombinase activating gene [RAG]-2−/− common cytokine receptor chain γ [γc]−/−) or IFN-γ signaling (IFN-γ−/− or IFN-γRα−/−) fail to initiate normal pregnancy-induced modification of decidual arteries and display hypocellularity or necrosis of decidua. To investigate the functions of uNK cell–derived IFN-γ during pregnancy, RAG-2−/−γc −/− females were engrafted with bone marrow from IFN-γ−/− mice, IFN-γ signal-disrupted mice (IFN-γRα−/− or signal transducer and activator of transcription [Stat]-1−/−), or from mice able to establish normal uNK cells (severe combined immunodeficient [SCID] or C57BL/6). Mated recipients were analyzed at midgestation. All grafts established uNK cells. Grafts from IFN-γ−/− mice did not reverse host vascular or decidual pathology. Grafts from all other donors promoted modification of decidual arteries and decidual cellularity. Grafts from IFN-γRα−/− or Stat-1−/− mice overproduced uNK cells, all of which were immature. Grafts from IFN-γ−/−, SCID, or C57BL/6 mice produced normal, mature uNK cells. Administration of murine recombinant IFN-γ to pregnant RAG-2−/−γc −/− mice initiated decidual vessel modification and promoted decidual cellularity in the absence of uNK cells. These in vivo findings strongly suggest that uNK cell–derived IFN-γ modifies the expression of genes in the uterine vasculature and stroma, which initiates vessel instability and facilitates pregnancy-induced remodeling of decidual arteries.",

    "title": "CD4+CD25−Foxp3− Th1 cells are the source of IL-10–mediated immune suppression in chronic cutaneous leishmaniasis",
    "abstract": "Nonhealing forms of leishmaniasis in humans are commonly associated with elevated levels of the deactivating cytokine IL-10, and in the mouse, normally chronic infections can be cleared in the absence of IL-10. Using a Leishmania major strain that produces nonhealing dermal lesions in a T helper type 1 (Th1) cell–polarized setting, we have analyzed the cellular sources of IL-10 and their relative contribution to immune suppression. IL-10 was produced by innate cells, as well as CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ and CD4+CD25−Foxp3− T cells in the chronic lesion. Nonetheless, only IL-10 production by antigen-specific CD4+CD25−Foxp3− T cells, the majority of which also produced IFN-γ, was necessary for suppression of acquired immunity in Rag−/− reconstituted mice. Surprisingly, Rag−/− mice reconstituted with naive CD4+ T cells depleted of natural T regulatory cells developed more severe infections, associated with elevated levels of IL-10 and, especially, Th2 cytokines in the site. The data demonstrate that IL-10–producing Th1 cells, activated early in a strong inflammatory setting as a mechanism of feedback control, are the principal mediators of T cell–derived IL-10–dependent immune suppression in a chronic intracellular infection.",

    "title": "Hybrid image segmentation using watersheds and fast region merging",
    "abstract": "A hybrid multidimensional image segmentation algorithm is proposed, which combines edge and region-based techniques through the morphological algorithm of watersheds. An edge-preserving statistical noise reduction approach is used as a preprocessing stage in order to compute an accurate estimate of the image gradient. Then, an initial partitioning of the image into primitive regions is produced by applying the watershed transform on the image gradient magnitude. This initial segmentation is the input to a computationally efficient hierarchical (bottom-up) region merging process that produces the final segmentation. The latter process uses the region adjacency graph (RAG) representation of the image regions. At each step, the most similar pair of regions is determined (minimum cost RAG edge), the regions are merged and the RAG is updated. Traditionally, the above is implemented by storing all RAG edges in a priority queue. We propose a significantly faster algorithm, which additionally maintains the so-called nearest neighbor graph, due to which the priority queue size and processing time are drastically reduced. The final segmentation provides, due to the RAG, one-pixel wide, closed, and accurately localized contours/surfaces. Experimental results obtained with two-dimensional/three-dimensional (2-D/3-D) magnetic resonance images are presented.",

In this review, we discuss recent advances in our understanding of the function and domain organization of the RAG proteins, the composition and structure of RAG-DNA complexes, and the pathways that lead to the formation of these complexes. We also consider the functional significance of RAG-mediated histone recognition and ubiquitin ligase activities, and the role played by RAG in ensuring proper repair of DNA breaks made during V(D)J recombination. Finally, we propose a model for the formation of RAG-DNA complexes that involves anchoring of RAG1 at the recombination signal nonamer and RAG2-dependent surveillance of adjoining DNA for suitable spacer and heptamer sequences.",

    "abstract": "Obesity is associated with the development of asthma and considerable asthma-related healthcare utilization. To understand the immunological pathways that lead to obesity-associated asthma, we fed mice a high fat diet for 12 weeks, which resulted in obesity and the development of airway hyperreactivity (AHR), a cardinal feature of asthma. This AHR depended on innate immunity, since it occurred in obese Rag −/− mice, and on IL-17A and the NLRP3 inflammasome, since it did not develop in obese Il17 −/− or Nlrp3 −/− mice. The AHR was also associated with the presence in the lungs of CCR6 + innate lymphoid cells producing IL-17A (ILC3 cells), which could by themselves mediate AHR when adoptively transferred into Rag2 −/− Il2r γ −/− mice. IL-1 β played an important role by expanding the ILC3 cells, and treatment to block the function of IL-1 β abolished obesity-induced AHR. Since we found ILC3-like cells in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of human patients with asthma, we suggest that obesity-associated asthma is facilitated inflammation",

    "title": "Structural basis for the docking of mTORC1 on the lysosomal surface",
    "abstract": "Complex regulation The protein kinase mTORC1 controls cellular growth in response to external signals. In the presence of nutrients, it localizes on the surface of the lysosome, where it is activated. The Raptor domain of mTORC1 binds to a complex comprising the protein Ragulator and a heterodimer of the Rag guanosine triphosphatase, which can adopt four different nucleotide conformations depending on nutrient availability. Rogala et al. determined the structure of the Raptor-Rag-Ragulator complex at 3.2-angstrom resolution by cryo–electron microscopy. The structure shows why Raptor binds only to a specific nucleotide conformation of the Rag heterodimer and suggests a model for how mTORC1 would dock onto the lysosomal surface, which is a key step in its activation. Science, this issue p. 468 mTORC1 senses nutrient sufficiency by recognizing conformational changes in its lysosomal anchor, heterodimeric Rag GTPase. The mTORC1 (mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1) protein kinase regulates growth in response to nutrients and growth factors. Nutrients promote its translocation to the lysosomal surface, where its Raptor subunit interacts with the Rag guanosine triphosphatase (GTPase)–Ragulator complex. Nutrients switch the heterodimeric Rag GTPases among four different nucleotide-binding states, only one of which (RagA/B•GTP–RagC/D•GDP) permits mTORC1 association. We used cryo–electron microscopy to determine the structure of the supercomplex of Raptor with Rag-Ragulator at a resolution of 3.2 angstroms. Our findings indicate that the Raptor α-solenoid directly detects the nucleotide state of RagA while the Raptor “claw” threads between the GTPase domains to detect that of RagC. Mutations that disrupted Rag-Raptor binding inhibited mTORC1 lysosomal localization and signaling. By comparison with a structure of mTORC1 bound to its activator Rheb, we developed a model of active mTORC1 docked on the lysosome.",

    "title": "IL-23 plays a key role in Helicobacter hepaticus–induced T cell–dependent colitis",
    "abstract": "Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the gastrointestinal tract that is caused in part by a dysregulated immune response to the intestinal flora. The common interleukin (IL)-12/IL-23p40 subunit is thought to be critical for the pathogenesis of IBD. We have analyzed the role of IL-12 versus IL-23 in two models of Helicobacter hepaticus–triggered T cell–dependent colitis, one involving anti–IL-10R monoclonal antibody treatment of infected T cell–sufficient hosts, and the other involving CD4+ T cell transfer into infected Rag−/− recipients. Our data demonstrate that IL-23 and not IL-12 is essential for the development of maximal intestinal disease. Although IL-23 has been implicated in the differentiation of IL-17–producing CD4+ T cells that alone are sufficient to induce autoimmune tissue reactivity, our results instead support a model in which IL-23 drives both interferon γ and IL-17 responses that together synergize to trigger severe intestinal inflammation.",

    "title": "Rapidly available glucose in foods: an in vitro measurement that reflects the glycemic response.",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nA chemically based classification of dietary carbohydrates that takes into account the likely site, rate, and extent of digestion is presented. The classification divides dietary carbohydrates into sugars, starch fractions, and nonstarch polysaccharides, and groups them into rapidly available glucose (RAG) and slowly available glucose (SAG) as to the amounts of glucose (from sugar and starch, including maltodextrins) likely to be available for rapid and slow absorption, respectively, in the human small intestine.\n\n\nOBJECTIVE\nWe hypothesize that RAG is an important food-related determinant of the glycemic response.\n\n\nDESIGN\nThe measurement of RAG, SAG, and starch fractions by an in vitro technique is described, based on the measurement by HPLC of the glucose released from a test food during timed incubation with digestive enzymes under standardized conditions. Eight healthy adult subjects consumed 8 separate test meals ranging in RAG content from 11 to 49 g.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe correlation between glycemic response and RAG was highly significant (P < 0.0001) and a given percentage increase in RAG was associated with the same percentage increase in glycemic response. After subject variation was accounted for, RAG explained 70% of the remaining variance in glycemic response.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nWe show the significance of in vitro measurements of RAG in relation to glycemic response in human studies. The simple in vitro measurement of RAG and SAG is of physiologic relevance and could serve as a tool for investigating the importance of the amount, type, and form of dietary carbohydrates for health.",

    "title": "Amino Acid-Dependent mTORC1 Regulation by the Lysosomal Membrane Protein SLC38A9",
    "abstract": "ABSTRACT The serine/threonine kinase mTORC1 regulates cellular homeostasis in response to many cues, such as nutrient status and energy level. Amino acids induce mTORC1 activation on lysosomes via the small Rag GTPases and the Ragulator complex, thereby controlling protein translation and cell growth. Here, we identify the human 11-pass transmembrane protein SLC38A9 as a novel component of the Rag-Ragulator complex. SLC38A9 localizes with Rag-Ragulator complex components on lysosomes and associates with Rag GTPases in an amino acid-sensitive and nucleotide binding state-dependent manner. Depletion of SLC38A9 inhibits mTORC1 activity in the presence of amino acids and in response to amino acid replenishment following starvation. Conversely, SLC38A9 overexpression causes RHEB (Ras homolog enriched in brain) GTPase-dependent hyperactivation of mTORC1 and partly sustains mTORC1 activity upon amino acid deprivation. Intriguingly, during amino acid starvation mTOR is retained at the lysosome upon SLC38A9 depletion but fails to be activated. Together, the findings of our study reveal SLC38A9 as a Rag-Ragulator complex member transducing amino acid availability to mTORC1 activity.",

    "abstract": "Acute lung injury (ALI) is characterized by rapid alveolar injury, inflammation, cytokine induction, and neutrophil accumulation. Although early events in the pathogenesis of ALI have been defined, the mechanisms underlying resolution are unknown. As a model of ALI, we administered intratracheal (i.t.) LPS to mice and observed peak lung injury 4 days after the challenge, with resolution by day 10. Numbers of alveolar lymphocytes increased as injury resolved. To examine the role of lymphocytes in this response, lymphocyte-deficient Rag-1-/- and C57BL/6 WT mice were exposed to i.t. LPS. The extent of injury was similar between the groups of mice through day 4, but recovery was markedly impaired in the Rag-1-/- mice. Adoptive transfer studies revealed that infusion of CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ Tregs as late as 24 hours after i.t. LPS normalized resolution in Rag-1-/- mice. Similarly, Treg depletion in WT mice delayed recovery. Treg transfer into i.t. LPS-exposed Rag-1-/- mice also corrected the elevated levels of alveolar proinflammatory cytokines and increased the diminished levels of alveolar TGF-beta and neutrophil apoptosis. Mechanistically, Treg-mediated resolution of lung injury was abrogated by TGF-beta inhibition. Moreover, BAL of patients with ALI revealed dynamic changes in CD3+CD4+CD25hiCD127loFoxp3+ cells. These results indicate that Tregs modify innate immune responses during resolution of lung injury and suggest potential targets for treating ALI, for which there are no specific therapies currently available.",

    "abstract": "Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) methods have been receiving increasing attention from the NLP community and achieved state-of-the-art performance on many NLP downstream tasks. Compared with conventional pre-trained generation models, RAG methods have remarkable advantages such as easy knowledge acquisition, strong scalability, and low training cost. Although existing RAG models have been applied to various knowledge-intensive NLP tasks, such as open-domain QA and dialogue systems, most of the work has focused on retrieving unstructured text documents from Wikipedia. In this paper, I first elaborate on the current obstacles to retrieving knowledge from a single-source homogeneous corpus. Then, I demonstrate evidence from both existing literature and my experiments, and provide multiple solutions on retrieval-augmented generation methods across heterogeneous knowledge.",

    "title": "Critical role for the chemokine receptor CXCR 6 in NK cell – mediated antigen-specific memory of haptens and viruses",
    "abstract": "The textbook view of adaptive immunity is that it is mediated exclusively by T cells and B cells, which rely on nonhomologous recombination of variable, diversity and joining gene segments mediated by the RAG-1–RAG-2 recombinase to generate a diverse repertoire of T cell and B cell antigen receptors1. The activation of such receptors by cognate antigen triggers clonal selection and differentiation into short-lived effector cells and long-lived memory cells that, after antigen rechallenge, mount accelerated and enhanced recall responses. Classic examples of such antigen-specific memory, the hallmark of adaptive immunity, include delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH)2,3 and hapten-induced contact hypersensitivity (CHS)4,5. Like T cells and B cells, natural killer (NK) cells mediate resistance to tumors and infections by a variety of mechanisms that are still incompletely understood6. However, NK cells cannot express RAG-dependent receptors and instead use germline-encoded receptors that integrate activating and dampening signals7. Notable examples of mouse NK cell receptors that detect specific pathogen–associated structures include NKp46 and Ly49H, which recognize influenza A–encoded hemagglutinin (HA)8,9 and the murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV)-encoded m157 protein10, respectively. Mouse NK cells can express just one Ly49 receptor or random combinations of several Ly49 receptors, some of which recognize host major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I (refs.11,12). Ly49H is a member of this family and confers NK cell– mediated resistance to MCMV infection in C57BL/6 mice. Notably, Ly49H+ NK cells develop features of adaptive immunity after infection with this virus13. However, as Ly49H is found only in the C57BL/6 strain14, it has been unclear whether NK cells can develop virus-specific memory in other genetic backgrounds or in response to viruses other than MCMV. This question may also be clinically relevant, as certain NK cell subsets have been linked to the ability of rare people infected with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) to exert long-term control over HIV-1 replication15,16. The idea that NK cells can mediate adaptive immunity was initially suggested by observations that mouse strains that lack T cells and B cells develop vigorous CHS responses to various distinct haptens17,18. These responses have the hallmarks of adaptive immunity: they are sensitization dependent, persist for at least 4 weeks and are elicited only by haptens to which mice have previously been sensitized17. Several lines of evidence have established that NK cells are necessary and sufficient for this activity: CHS responses in mice deficient in recombination-activating gene 2 (Rag2−/− mice) are abolished after depletion of NK cells and are absent from Rag2−/− mice also deficient in the gene encoding the γ-chain of the interleukin 2 (IL-2) receptor (Il2rg−/− mice), which lack all lymphocytes, including NK cells19. Moreover, after sensitization of donor mice with 2,4dinitro-1-fluorobenzene (DNFB), adoptive transfer of NK cells from donor livers confers vigorous CHS to naive Rag2−/−Il2rg−/− recipient mice but adoptive transfer of NK cells from spleens does not. Among hepatic NK cells, DNFB-specific memory is concentrated in a subset expressing Thy-1 and Ly49C/I17. However, those and all other NK",

    "title": "The regulated expression of B lineage associated genes during B cell differentiation in bone marrow and fetal liver",
    "abstract": "The expression of B lineage associated genes during early B cell differentiation stages is not firmly established. Using cell surface markers and multiparameter flow cytometry, bone marrow (BM) cells can be resolved into six fractions, representing sequential stages of development; i.e., pre-Pro-B, early Pro-B, late Pro-B/large Pre-B, small Pre-B, immature B, and mature B cells. Here we quantitate the levels of several B lineage associated genes in each of these fractions by RT-PCR, demonstrating different patterns of expression. We find that expression of terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT), lambda 5, and VpreB is predominantly restricted to the Pro-B stages. Rag-1 and Rag-2 expression is also tightly regulated, and is found largely in the Pro-B through small Pre-B stages. Mb-1 is present from Pro-B throughout the pathway at high levels. Finally, Bcl-2 is expressed at high levels only at the pre-Pro-B and mature B stages, whereas it is low during all the intermediate stages. We also correlate this expression data with an analysis of the onset of Ig gene rearrangement as assessed by amplifying D-JH, VH-DJH, and VK-JK. Finally, we report differences in gene expression during B lymphopoiesis at two distinct ontogenic timings, in fetal liver and adult BM: both TdT and the precursor lymphocyte regulated myosin-like light chain are expressed at high levels in the Pro-B cell stage in bone marrow, but are absent from the corresponding fraction in fetal liver. In contrast, lambda 5, VpreB, Rag-1, and Rag-2 are expressed at comparable levels.",

    "title": "SCID genotype and 6-month posttransplant CD4 count predict survival and immune recovery.",
    "abstract": "The Primary Immune Deficiency Treatment Consortium (PIDTC) performed a retrospective analysis of 662 patients with severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) who received a hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) as first-line treatment between 1982 and 2012 in 33 North American institutions. Overall survival was higher after HCT from matched-sibling donors (MSDs). Among recipients of non-MSD HCT, multivariate analysis showed that the SCID genotype strongly influenced survival and immune reconstitution. Overall survival was similar for patients with RAG, IL2RG, or JAK3 defects and was significantly better compared with patients with ADA or DCLRE1C mutations. Patients with RAG or DCLRE1C mutations had poorer immune reconstitution than other genotypes. Although survival did not correlate with the type of conditioning regimen, recipients of reduced-intensity or myeloablative conditioning had a lower incidence of treatment failure and better T- and B-cell reconstitution, but a higher risk for graft-versus-host disease, compared with those receiving no conditioning or immunosuppression only. Infection-free status and younger age at HCT were associated with improved survival. Typical SCID, leaky SCID, and Omenn syndrome had similar outcomes. Landmark analysis identified CD4+ and CD4+CD45RA+ cell counts at 6 and 12 months post-HCT as biomarkers predictive of overall survival and long-term T-cell reconstitution. Our data emphasize the need for patient-tailored treatment strategies depending upon the underlying SCID genotype. The prognostic significance of CD4+ cell counts as early as 6 months after HCT emphasizes the importance of close follow-up of immune reconstitution to identify patients who may need additional intervention to prevent poor long-term outcome.",

    "title": "Moralizing gods, impartiality and religious parochialism across 15 societies",
    "abstract": "The emergence of large-scale cooperation during the Holocene remains a central problem in the evolutionary literature. One hypothesis points to culturally evolved beliefs in punishing, interventionist gods that facilitate the extension of cooperative behaviour toward geographically distant co-religionists. Furthermore, another hypothesis points to such mechanisms being constrained to the religious ingroup, possibly at the expense of religious outgroups. To test these hypotheses, we administered two behavioural experiments and a set of interviews to a sample of 2228 participants from 15 diverse populations. These populations included foragers, pastoralists, horticulturalists, and wage labourers, practicing Buddhism, Christianity, and Hinduism, but also forms of animism and ancestor worship. Using the Random Allocation Game (RAG) and the Dictator Game (DG) in which individuals allocated money between themselves, local and geographically distant co-religionists, and religious outgroups, we found that higher ratings of gods as monitoring and punishing predicted decreased local favouritism (RAGs) and increased resource-sharing with distant co-religionists (DGs). The effects of punishing and monitoring gods on outgroup allocations revealed between-site variability, suggesting that in the absence of intergroup hostility, moralizing gods may be implicated in cooperative behaviour toward outgroups. These results provide support for the hypothesis that beliefs in monitoring and punitive gods help expand the circle of sustainable social interaction, and open questions about the treatment of religious outgroups.",

    "title": "The Portuguese Severe Asthma Registry: Development, Features, and Data Sharing Policies",
    "abstract": "The Portuguese Severe Asthma Registry (Registo de Asma Grave Portugal, RAG) was developed by an open collaborative network of asthma specialists. RAG collects data from adults and pediatric severe asthma patients that despite treatment optimization and adequate management of comorbidities require step 4/5 treatment according to GINA recommendations. In this paper, we describe the development and implementation of RAG, its features, and data sharing policies. The contents and structure of RAG were defined in a multistep consensus process. A pilot version was pretested and iteratively improved. The selection of data elements for RAG considered other severe asthma registries, aiming at characterizing the patient's clinical status whilst avoiding overloading the standard workflow of the clinical appointment. Features of RAG include automatic assessment of eligibility, easy data input, and exportable data in natural language that can be pasted directly in patients' electronic health record and security features to enable data sharing (among researchers and with other international databases) without compromising patients' confidentiality. RAG is a national web-based disease registry of severe asthma patients, available at asmagrave.pt. It allows prospective clinical data collection, promotes standardized care and collaborative clinical research, and may contribute to inform evidence-based healthcare policies for severe asthma.",

    "title": "Abstract B122: Molecular mechanism of V(D)J recombination from synaptic RAG1-RAG2 complex structures",
    "abstract": "A hallmark of vertebrate immunity is the diverse repertoire of antigen-receptor genes that results from combinatorial splicing of gene coding segments by V(D)J recombination. The dimeric (RAG1-RAG2)2 recombinase (RAG) recognizes specific recombination signal sequences (RSSs), each containing a heptamer, a spacer of 12 or 23 base pairs, and a nonamer (12-RSS or 23-RSS). RAG only combines one 12-RSS and one 23-RSS, a dogma known as the 12/23 rule that governs the fidelity of V(D)J recombination. RAG introduces precise breaks at RSS-coding segment junctions to generate cleaved RSSs and hairpin coding segments. Here we report cryo-electron microscopy structures of multiple RAG complexes reconstituted with 12-RSS and 23-RSS intermediates and HMGB1 at up to 3.4 angstrom resolution. These structures reveal a closed conformation of RAG upon RSS synapsis, with base flipping and base-specific recognition of RSSs. Distortion at the RSS-coding segment junction and base flipping in the coding segment uncovers the geometry for a two-metal-ion catalytic mechanism. Both 12-RSS and 23-RSS are exceedingly bent by the bound HMGB1. The nonamer-binding domain dimer of RAG1 is flexibly attached to the active site dimer of RAG and is tilted towards the bent 12-RSS but away from the bent 23-RSS in the synaptic complexes, which provides an induced fit mechanism for the 12/23 rule. Collectively, our structures illustrate the elegant mechanisms of RAG-catalyzed V(D)J recombination at the molecular level. Citation Format: Heng Ru, Melissa G. Chambers, Tian-Min Fu, Alexander B.

    "abstract": "Structure of human mTORC1 components The mTORC1 (mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1) complex garners much attention as a signaling hub that coordinates input from growth-factor receptors and nutrient availability with metabolism and cell growth and proliferation. de Araujo et al. report the crystal structure of the LAMTOR (or “Ragulator”) complex that helps assemble mTORC1 at the lysosomal membrane for activation. The structure and functional studies reveal how LAMTOR1 wraps around the other subunits to hold them in place and interacts with the Rag guanosine triphosphatases in the complex. Science, this issue p. 377 Structural insights into nutrient and growth factor signaling at the lysosome. The LAMTOR [late endosomal and lysosomal adaptor and MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase) and mTOR (mechanistic target of rapamycin) activator] complex, also known as “Ragulator,” controls the activity of mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) on the lysosome. The crystal structure of LAMTOR consists of two roadblock/LC7 domain–folded heterodimers wrapped and apparently held together by LAMTOR1, which assembles the complex on lysosomes. In addition, the Rag guanosine triphosphatases (GTPases) associated with the pentamer through their carboxyl-terminal domains, predefining the orientation for interaction with mTORC1. In vitro reconstitution and experiments with site-directed mutagenesis defined the physiological importance of LAMTOR1 in assembling the remaining components to ensure fidelity of mTORC1 signaling. Functional data validated the effect of two short LAMTOR1 amino acid regions in recruitment and stabilization of the Rag GTPases.",

    "title": "Identification of Multiple Isolated Lymphoid Follicles on the Antimesenteric Wall of the Mouse Small Intestine1",
    "abstract": "We have revealed that 100–200 clusters, filled with closely packed lymphocytes, can be found throughout the length of the antimesenteric wall of the mouse small intestine. They are composed of a large B cell area, including a germinal center, and epithelia overlying the clusters contain M cells. A large fraction of B cells displays B220+CD19+CD23+IgMlowIgDhighCD5−Mac-1− phenotype, and the composition of IgA+ B cells is smaller but substantial. To our knowledge, these clusters are the first identification of isolated lymphoid follicles (ILF) in mouse small intestine. ILF can be first detected at 7 (BALB/c mice) and 25 (C57BL/6 mice) days after birth, and lymphoid clusters equivalent in terms of cellular mass to ILF are present in germfree, athymic nude, RAG-2−/−, TCR-β−/−, and Ig μ-chain mutant (μm−/−) mice, although c-kit+ cells outnumber B220+ cells in germfree and athymic nude mice, and most lymphoid residents are c-kit+B220− in RAG-2−/−, TCR-β−/−, and μm−/− mice. ILF develop normally in the progeny of transplacentally manipulated Peyer’s patch (PP)-deficient mice, and decreased numbers of conspicuously atrophied ILF are present in IL-7Rα−/− PPnull mice. Neither ILF nor PP are detectable in lymphotoxin α−/− and aly/aly mice that retain well-developed cryptopatches (CP) and thymus-independent subsets of intraepithelial T cells, whereas ILF, PP, CP, and thymus-independent subsets of intraepithelial T cells disappear from common cytokine receptor γ-chain mutant mice. These findings indicate that ILF, PP, and CP constitute three distinct organized gut-associated lymphoid tissues that reside in the lamina propria of the mouse small intestine.",

    "title": "Regulatory T cells suppress innate immunity in kidney ischemia-reperfusion injury.",
    "abstract": "Both innate and adaptive mechanisms participate in the pathogenesis of kidney ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI), but the role of regulatory immune mechanisms is unknown. We hypothesized that the anti-inflammatory effects of CD4(+)CD25(+)FoxP3(+) regulatory T cells (Tregs) protect against renal IRI. Partial depletion of Tregs with an anti-CD25 mAb potentiated kidney damage induced by IRI. Reducing the number of Tregs resulted in more neutrophils, macrophages, and innate cytokine transcription in the kidney after IRI but did not affect CD4(+) T cells or B cells. We performed adoptive transfer of lymph node cells from wild-type mice or FoxP3-deficient Scurfy mice into T cell- and B cell-deficient RAG-1 knockout mice to generate mice with and without FoxP3(+) Tregs, respectively. FoxP3(+) Treg-deficient mice accumulated a greater number of inflammatory leukocytes after renal IRI than mice containing Tregs. To confirm that a lack of Tregs potentiated renal injury, we co-transferred isolated Tregs and Scurfy lymph node cells; Treg repletion significantly attenuated IRI-induced renal injury and leukocyte accumulation. Furthermore, although adoptive transfer of wild-type Tregs into RAG-1 knockout mice was sufficient to prevent kidney IRI, transfer of IL-10-deficient Tregs was not. Taken together, these results demonstrate that Tregs modulate injury after kidney IRI through IL-10-mediated suppression of the innate immune system.",

    "abstract": "Encephalitogenic T cells that mediate experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) are commonly assumed to be exclusively CD4+, but formal proof is still lacking. In this study, we report that synthetic peptides 35–55 from myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (pMOG35–55) consistently activate a high proportion of CD8+ αβTCR+ T cells that are encephalitogenic in C57BL/6 (B6) mice. The encephalitogenic potential of CD8+ MOG-specific T cells was established by adoptive transfer of CD8-enriched MOG-specific T cells. These cells induced a much more severe and permanent disease than disease actively induced by immunization with pMOG35–55. CNS lesions in pMOG35–55 CD8+ T cell-induced EAE were progressive and more destructive. The CD8+ T cells were strongly pathogenic in syngeneic B6 and RAG-1−/− mice, but not in isogeneic β2-microglobulin-deficient mice. MOG-specific CD8+ T cells could be repeatedly reisolated for up to 287 days from recipient B6 or RAG-1−/− mice in which disease was induced adoptively with <1 × 106 T cells sensitized to pMOG35–55. It is postulated that MOG induces a relapsing and/or progressive pattern of EAE by eliciting a T cell response dominated by CD8+ autoreactive T cells. Such cells appear to have an enhanced tissue-damaging effect and persist in the animal for long periods.",

Notch1 receptor is a known modulator of lineage-specific events in hematopoiesis that we assessed in the context of in vivo stem cell kinetics. Using RAG-1(-/-) mouse stems cells, we documented increased stem cell numbers due to decreased differentiation and enhanced stem cell self-renewal induced by Notch1. Unexpectedly, preferential lymphoid over myeloid lineage commitment was noted when differentiation occurred. Therefore, Notch1 affects 2 decision points in stem cell regulation, favoring self-renewal over differentiation and lymphoid over myeloid lineage outcome. Notch1 offers an attractive target for stem cell manipulation strategies, particularly in the context of immunodeficiency and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome.",

    "title": "Evolutionary Conservation of the Components in the TOR Signaling Pathways",
    "abstract": "Target of rapamycin (TOR) is an evolutionarily conserved protein kinase that controls multiple cellular processes upon various intracellular and extracellular stimuli. Since its first discovery, extensive studies have been conducted both in yeast and animal species including humans. Those studies have revealed that TOR forms two structurally and physiologically distinct protein complexes; TOR complex 1 (TORC1) is ubiquitous among eukaryotes including animals, yeast, protozoa, and plants, while TOR complex 2 (TORC2) is conserved in diverse eukaryotic species other than plants. The studies have also identified two crucial regulators of mammalian TORC1 (mTORC1), Ras homolog enriched in brain (RHEB) and RAG GTPases. Of these, RAG regulates TORC1 in yeast as well and is conserved among eukaryotes with the green algae and land plants as apparent exceptions. RHEB is present in various eukaryotes but sporadically missing in multiple taxa. RHEB, in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, appears to be extremely divergent with concomitant loss of its function as a TORC1 regulator. In this review, we summarize the evolutionarily conserved functions of the key regulatory subunits of TORC1 and TORC2, namely RAPTOR, RICTOR, and SIN1. We also delve into the evolutionary conservation of RHEB and RAG and discuss the conserved roles of these GTPases in regulating TORC1.",

In this study, we show that double-negative T cells from MRL/lpr mice express high amounts of IL-17 and that as disease progressively worsens, the expression of IL-17 and of IL-23 receptor in lymphocytes from these mice increases. Lymph node cells from lupus-prone mice, but not control mice, treated in vitro with IL-23 induce nephritis when transferred to non-autoimmune, lymphocyte-deficient Rag-1−/− mice. Kidney specimens from these recipient mice show significant Ig and complement deposition. The data indicate that an aberrantly active IL-23/IL-17 axis contributes to the development of nephritis in lupus-prone mice.",

    "title": "Prediction of the elastic modulus of recycled aggregate concrete applying hybrid artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms",
    "abstract": "Recycled aggregates (RAGs) usage in concrete is surging, inspired by environmental and economic concerns. Regarding predicting various models designed the values of modulus of elasticity (MOE) of concrete with natural aggregates and, in conclusion, they would probably be unreliable when used to concrete with RAG. In the present study, two new gray wolf multi‐layer perceptron neural networks (GWMLP) and gray wolf support vector regression (GWSVR) algorithms were proposed to predict RAG concrete's elastic modulus. About 400 records were gathered from published articles to develop these models. The results show that among the GWMLP models with different hidden layers, GWM3L with three hidden layers could get the highest score (TRS) at 39. Simultaneously, in the testing phase, the GWSVR was the first‐rank model because of the lower RMSE (0.6381), MAE (0.1541), and a larger R2 (0.9707) compared with GWMLP models. Therefore, it can result that the GWSVR model could predict the elastic modulus of RAG concrete precisely even better than GWM3L, which is well over the accuracy of the developed models.",

    "title": "CTCF orchestrates long-range cohesin-driven V(D)J recombinational scanning",
    "abstract": "The RAG endonuclease initiates Igh locus V(D)J recombination in progenitor (pro)-B cells 1 . Upon binding a recombination centre-based J H , RAG scans upstream chromatin via loop extrusion, potentially mediated by cohesin, to locate Ds and assemble a DJ H -based recombination centre 2 . CTCF looping factor-bound elements (CBEs) within IGCR1 upstream of Ds impede RAG scanning 3 – 5 ; however, their inactivation allows scanning to proximal V H s, where additional CBEs activate rearrangement and impede scanning any further upstream 5 . Distal V H utilization is thought to involve diffusional access to the recombination centre following large-scale Igh locus contraction 6 – 8 . Here we test the potential of linear RAG scanning to mediate distal V H usage in G1-arrested v-Abl pro-B cell lines 9 , which undergo robust D-to-J H but little V H -to-DJ H rearrangements, presumably owing to lack of locus contraction 2 , 5 . Through an auxin-inducible approach 10 , we degraded the cohesin component RAD21 10 – 12 or CTCF 12 , 13 in these G1-arrested lines. Degradation of RAD21 eliminated all V(D)J recombination and interactions associated with RAG scanning, except for reecombination centre-located DQ52-to-J H joining, in which synapsis occurs by diffusion 2 . Remarkably, while degradation of CTCF suppressed most CBE-based chromatin interactions, it promoted robust recombination centre interactions with, and robust V H -to-DJ H joining of, distal V H s, with patterns similar to those of ‘locus-contracted’ primary pro-B cells. Thus, downmodulation of CTCF-bound scanning-impediment activity promotes cohesin-driven RAG scanning across the 2.7-Mb Igh locus. Using an auxin-inducible approach, the authors show that downmodulation of CTCF activity promotes cohesin-driven RAG endonuclease scanning, and thus V(D)J recombination, across the Igh locus.",

    "title": "Horting hatches an egg: a new graph-theoretic approach to collaborative filtering",
    "abstract": "This paper introduces a new and novel approach to ratingbased collaborative filtering. The new technique is most appropriate for e-commerce merchants offering one or more groups of relatively homogeneous items such as compact disks, videos, books, software and the like. In contrast with other known collaborative filtering techniques, the new algorithm is graph-theoretic, based on the twin new concepts of ho&rag and predictability. As is demonstrated in this paper, the technique is fast, scalable, accurate, and requires only a modest learning curve. It makes use of a hierarchical classification scheme in order to introduce context into the rating process, and uses so-called creative links in order to find surprising and atypical items to recommend, perhaps even items which cross the group boundaries. The new technique is one of the key engines of the Intelligent Recommendation Algorithm (IRA) project, now being developed at IBM Research. In addition to several other recommendation engines, IRA contains a situation analyzer to determine the most appropriate mix of engines for a particular e-commerce merchant, as well as an engine for optimizing the placement of advertisements.",

    "abstract": "The aims of this paper were to investigate the effectiveness of a newly developed wearable hip assist robot, that uses an active assist algorithm to improve gait function, muscle effort, and cardiopulmonary metabolic efficiency in elderly adults. Thirty elderly adults (15 males/ 15 females) participated in thispaper. The experimental protocol consisted of overground gait at comfortable speed under three different conditions: free gait without robot assistance, robot-assisted gait with zero torque (RAG-Z), and full RAG. Under all conditions, muscle effort was analyzed using a 12-channel surface electromyography system. Spatio-temporal data were collected at 120 Hz using a 3-D motion capture system with six infrared cameras. Metabolic cost parameters were collected as oxygen consumption per unit (ml/min/kg) and aerobic energy expenditure (Kcal/min). In the RAG condition, participants demonstrated improved gait function, decreased muscle effort, and reduced metabolic cost. Although the hip assist robot only provides assistance at the hip joint, our results demonstrated a clear reduction in knee and ankle muscle activity in addition to decreased hip flexor and extensor activity. Our findings suggest that this robot has the potential to improve stabilization of the trunk during walking in elderly adults.",

We transform the input images into region adjacency graphs (RAGs), in which regions are superpixels and edges connect neighboring superpixels. Our experiments suggest that Graph Attention Networks (GATs), which combine graph convolutions with self-attention mechanisms, outperforms other GNN models. Although raw image classifiers perform better than GATs due to in-formation loss during the RAG generation, our methodology opens an interesting avenue of research on deep learning beyond rectangular-gridded images, such as 360-degree field of view panoramas. Traditional convolutional kernels of current state-of-the-art methods cannot handle panoramas, whereas the adapted superpixel algorithms and the resulting region adjacency graphs can naturally feed a GNN, without topology issues.",

In particular, in this study we show that Treg directly inhibit NKG2D-mediated NK cell cytotoxicity in vitro and in vivo, effectively suppressing NK cell-mediated tumor rejection. In vitro, Treg were shown to inhibit NKG2D-mediated cytolysis largely by a TGF-β-dependent mechanism and independently of IL-10. Adoptively transferred Treg suppressed NK cell antimetastatic function in RAG-1-deficient mice. Depletion of Treg before NK cell activation via NKG2D and the activating IL-12 cytokine, dramatically enhanced NK cell-mediated suppression of tumor growth and metastases. Our data illustrate at least one mechanism by which Treg can suppress NK cell antitumor activity and highlight the effectiveness of combining Treg inhibition with subsequent NK cell activation to promote strong innate antitumor immunity.",

    "abstract": "Fetal survival during gestation implies that tolerance mechanisms suppress the maternal immune response to paternally inherited alloantigens. Here we show that the inhibitory T cell costimulatory molecule, programmed death ligand 1 (PDL1), has an important role in conferring fetomaternal tolerance in an allogeneic pregnancy model. Blockade of PDL1 signaling during murine pregnancy resulted in increased rejection rates of allogeneic concepti but not syngeneic concepti. Fetal rejection was T cell– but not B cell–dependent because PDL1-specific antibody treatment caused fetal rejection in B cell–deficient but not in RAG-1–deficient females. Blockade of PDL1 also resulted in a significant increase in the frequency of IFN-γ–producing lymphocytes in response to alloantigen in an ELISPOT assay and higher IFN-γ levels in placental homogenates by ELISA. Finally, PDL1-deficient females exhibited decreased allogeneic fetal survival rates as compared with littermate and heterozygote controls and showed evidence of expansion of T helper type 1 immune responses in vivo. These results provide the first evidence that PDL1 is involved in fetomaternal tolerance.",

    "title": "Inhibition of glioma growth in vivo by selective activation of the CB(2) cannabinoid receptor.",
    "abstract": "The development of new therapeutic strategies is essential for the management of gliomas, one of the most malignant forms of cancer. We have shown previously that the growth of the rat glioma C6 cell line is inhibited by psychoactive cannabinoids (I. Galve-Roperh et al., Nat. Med., 6: 313-319, 2000). These compounds act on the brain and some other organs through the widely expressed CB(1) receptor. By contrast, the other cannabinoid receptor subtype, the CB(2) receptor, shows a much more restricted distribution and is absent from normal brain. Here we show that local administration of the selective CB(2) agonist JWH-133 at 50 microg/day to Rag-2(-/-) mice induced a considerable regression of malignant tumors generated by inoculation of C6 glioma cells. The selective involvement of the CB(2) receptor in this action was evidenced by: (a) the prevention by the CB(2) antagonist SR144528 but not the CB(1) antagonist SR141716; (b) the down-regulation of the CB(2) receptor but not the CB(1) receptor in the tumors; and (c) the absence of typical CB(1)-mediated psychotropic side effects. Cannabinoid receptor expression was subsequently examined in biopsies from human astrocytomas. A full 70% (26 of 37) of the human astrocytomas analyzed expressed significant levels of cannabinoid receptors. Of interest, the extent of CB(2) receptor expression was directly related with tumor malignancy. In addition, the growth of grade IV human astrocytoma cells in Rag-2(-/-) mice was completely blocked by JWH-133 administration at 50 microg/day. Experiments carried out with C6 glioma cells in culture evidenced the internalization of the CB(2) but not the CB(1) receptor upon JWH-133 challenge and showed that selective activation of the CB(2) receptor signaled apoptosis via enhanced ceramide synthesis de novo. These results support a therapeutic approach for the treatment of malignant gliomas devoid of psychotropic side effects.",

    "title": "Discovering Discriminative Graphlets for Aerial Image Categories Recognition",
    "abstract": "Recognizing aerial image categories is useful for scene annotation and surveillance. Local features have been demonstrated to be robust to image transformations, including occlusions and clutters. However, the geometric property of an aerial image (i.e., the topology and relative displacement of local features), which is key to discriminating aerial image categories, cannot be effectively represented by state-of-the-art generic visual descriptors. To solve this problem, we propose a recognition model that mines graphlets from aerial images, where graphlets are small connected subgraphs reflecting both the geometric property and color/texture distribution of an aerial image. More specifically, each aerial image is decomposed into a set of basic components (e.g., road and playground) and a region adjacency graph (RAG) is accordingly constructed to model their spatial interactions. Aerial image categories recognition can subsequently be casted as RAG-to-RAG matching. Based on graph theory, RAG-to-RAG matching is conducted by comparing all their respective graphlets. Because the number of graphlets is huge, we derive a manifold embedding algorithm to measure different-sized graphlets, after which we select graphlets that have highly discriminative and low redundancy topologies. Through quantizing the selected graphlets from each aerial image into a feature vector, we use support vector machine to discriminate aerial image categories. Experimental results indicate that our method outperforms several state-of-the-art object/scene recognition models, and the visualized graphlets indicate that the discriminative patterns are discovered by our proposed approach.",

    "title": "Atf3 mutant mice show reduced axon regeneration and impaired regeneration-associated gene induction after peripheral nerve injury",
    "abstract": "Axon injury in the peripheral nervous system (PNS) induces a regeneration-associated gene (RAG) response. Atf3 (activating transcription factor 3) is such a RAG and ATF3's transcriptional activity might induce ‘effector’ RAGs (e.g. small proline rich protein 1a (Sprr1a), Galanin (Gal), growth-associated protein 43 (Gap43)) facilitating peripheral axon regeneration. We provide a first analysis of Atf3 mouse mutants in peripheral nerve regeneration. In Atf3 mutant mice, facial nerve regeneration and neurite outgrowth of adult ATF3-deficient primary dorsal root ganglia neurons was decreased. Using genome-wide transcriptomics, we identified a neuropeptide-encoding RAG cluster (vasoactive intestinal peptide (Vip), Ngf, Grp, Gal, Pacap) regulated by ATF3. Exogenous administration of neuropeptides enhanced neurite growth of Atf3 mutant mice suggesting that these molecules might be effector RAGs of ATF3's pro-regenerative function. In addition to the induction of growth-promoting molecules, we present data that ATF3 suppresses growth-inhibiting molecules such as chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 2. In summary, we show a pro-regenerative ATF3 function during PNS nerve regeneration involving transcriptional activation of a neuropeptide-encoding RAG cluster. ATF3 is a general injury-inducible factor, therefore ATF3-mediated mechanisms identified herein might apply to other cell and injury types.",

    "abstract": "Le revenu annuel garanti (RAG), en tant que stratégie de réduction de la pauvreté, a régulièrement fait l’objet de débats au Canada, et l’idée retient aujourd’hui de plus en plus l’attention. Dans cet article, nous évaluons l’efficacité d’une telle stratégie, en utilisant l’insécurité alimentaire comme indicateur de la pauvreté chez les adultes célibataires de 55 à 74 ans à deux moments : avant l’âge de l’admissibilité aux pensions publiques, c’est-à-dire 65 ans, puis après. Les données de l’Enquête sur la santé dans les collectivités canadiennes (2007–2013) montrent que la prévalence de l’insécurité alimentaire est 50 % moins élevée chez les Canadiens de plus de 65 ans que chez les Canadiens à faible revenu de moins de 65 ans. Les pensions publiques versées aux personnes âgées, considérées comme un exemple de RAG, sont donc une stratégie efficace de réduction de la pauvreté.",

    "title": "Probabilistic Graphlet Transfer for Photo Cropping",
    "abstract": "As one of the most basic photo manipulation processes, photo cropping is widely used in the printing, graphic design, and photography industries. In this paper, we introduce graphlets (i.e., small connected subgraphs) to represent a photo's aesthetic features, and propose a probabilistic model to transfer aesthetic features from the training photo onto the cropped photo. In particular, by segmenting each photo into a set of regions, we construct a region adjacency graph (RAG) to represent the global aesthetic feature of each photo. Graphlets are then extracted from the RAGs, and these graphlets capture the local aesthetic features of the photos. Finally, we cast photo cropping as a candidate-searching procedure on the basis of a probabilistic model, and infer the parameters of the cropped photos using Gibbs sampling. The proposed method is fully automatic. Subjective evaluations have shown that it is preferred over a number of existing approaches.",

    "abstract": "Chronic inflammatory autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis, diabetes, and rheumatoid arthritis are caused by CD4+ Th1 cells. Because Th2 cells antagonize Th1 cell functions in several ways, it is believed that immune deviation towards Th2 can prevent or cure autoimmune diseases. Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) is a demyelinating disease used as a model for multiple sclerosis. Using an adoptive transfer system we assessed the role of Th1 and Th2 cells in EAE. In vitro generated Th1 and Th2 cells from myelin basic protein (MBP)-specific TCR transgenic mice were transferred into normal and immunodeficient mice. Th1 cells caused EAE in all recipients after a brief preclinical phase. Surprisingly, Th2 cells also caused EAE in RAG-1 KO mice and in αβ T cell–deficient mice, albeit after a longer preclinical phase. Normal or γδ T cell–deficient mice were resistant to EAE induced by Th2 cells. The histopathological features of this disease resembled those of an allergic process. In addition, disease induction by Th1 cells was not altered by coadmininstration of Th2 cells in any of the recipients. These findings indicate that MBP-specific Th2 cells have the potential to induce EAE and that the disease induced by previously activated Th1 cells cannot be prevented by normal lymphocytes nor by previously activated Th2 cells.",

    "title": "A Mouse Model for Human Norovirus",
    "abstract": "ABSTRACT Human noroviruses (HuNoVs) cause significant morbidity and mortality worldwide. However, despite substantial efforts, a small-animal model for HuNoV has not been described to date. Since “humanized” mice have been successfully used to study human-tropic pathogens in the past, we challenged BALB/c mice deficient in recombination activation gene (Rag) 1 or 2 and common gamma chain (γc) (Rag-γc) engrafted with human CD34+ hematopoietic stem cells, nonengrafted siblings, and immunocompetent wild-type controls with pooled stool isolates from patients positive for HuNoV. Surprisingly, both humanized and nonhumanized BALB/c Rag-γc-deficient mice supported replication of a GII.4 strain of HuNoV, as indicated by increased viral loads over input. In contrast, immunocompetent wild-type BALB/c mice were not infected. An intraperitoneal route of infection and the BALB/c genetic background were important for facilitating a subclinical HuNoV infection of Rag-γc-deficient mice. Expression of structural and nonstructural proteins was detected in cells with macrophage-like morphology in the spleens and livers of BALB/c Rag-γc-deficient mice, confirming the ability of HuNoV to replicate in a mouse model. In summary, HuNoV replication in BALB/c Rag-γc-deficient mice is dependent on the immune-deficient status of the host but not on the presence of human immune cells and provides the first genetically manipulable small-animal model for studying HuNoV infection. IMPORTANCE Human noroviruses are a significant cause of viral gastroenteritis worldwide, resulting in significant morbidity and mortality. Antivirals and vaccines are currently not available, in part due to the inability to study these viruses in a genetically manipulable, small-animal model. Herein, we report the first mouse model for human noroviruses. This model will accelerate our understanding of human norovirus biology and provide a useful resource for evaluating antiviral therapies.

    "title": "New insights into the evolutionary origins of the recombination‐activating gene proteins and V(D)J recombination",
    "abstract": "The adaptive immune system of jawed vertebrates relies on V(D)J recombination as one of the main processes to generate the diverse array of receptors necessary for the recognition of a wide range of pathogens. The DNA cleavage reaction necessary for the assembly of the antigen receptor genes from an array of potential gene segments is mediated by the recombination‐activating gene proteins RAG1 and RAG2. The RAG proteins have been proposed to originate from a transposable element (TE) as they share mechanistic and structural similarities with several families of transposases and are themselves capable of mediating transposition. A number of RAG‐like proteins and TEs with sequence similarity to RAG1 and RAG2 have been identified, but only recently has their function begun to be characterized, revealing mechanistic links to the vertebrate RAGs. Of particular significance is the discovery of ProtoRAG, a transposon superfamily found in the genome of the basal chordate amphioxus. ProtoRAG has many of the sequence and mechanistic features predicted for the ancestral RAG transposon and is likely to be an evolutionary relative of RAG1 and RAG2. In addition, early observations suggesting that RAG1 is able to mediate V(D)J recombination in the absence of RAG2 have been confirmed, implying independent evolutionary origins for the two RAG genes. Here, recent progress in identifying and characterizing RAG‐like proteins and the TEs that encode them is summarized and a refined model for the evolution of V(D)J recombination and the RAG proteins is presented.",

Deregulation of mTORC1 can lead to diseases such as diabetes, obesity, and cancer. A series of small GTPases, including Rag, Ras homolog enriched in brain (Rheb), adenosine diphosphate ribosylation factor 1 (Arf1), Ras-related protein Ral-A, Ras homolog (Rho), and Rab, are involved in regulating mTORC1 in response to nutrients, and mTORC1 is differentially regulated via these small GTPases according to specific conditions. Leucine and arginine sensing are considered to be well-confirmed amino acid-sensing signals, activating mTORC1 via a Rag GTPase-dependent mechanism as well as the Ragulator complex and vacuolar H+-adenosine triphosphatase (v-ATPase). Glutamine promotes mTORC1 activation via Arf1 independently of the Rag GTPase. In this review, we summarize current knowledge regarding the regulation of mTORC1 activity by small GTPases in response to nutrients, focusing on the function of small GTPases in mTORC1 activation and how small GTPases are regulated by nutrients.",

    "title": "A phylogenetic hypothesis for passerine birds: taxonomic and biogeographic implications of an analysis of nuclear DNA sequence data",
    "abstract": "Passerine birds comprise over half of avian diversity, but have proved difficult to classify. Despite a long history of work on this group, no comprehensive hypothesis of passerine family–level relationships was available until recent analyses of DNA–DNA hybridization data. Unfortunately, given the value of such a hypothesis in comparative studies of passerine ecology and behaviour, the DNA–hybridization results have not been well tested using independent data and analytical approaches. Therefore, we analysed nucleotide sequence variation at the nuclear RAG–1 and c–mos genes from 69 passerine taxa, including representatives of most currently recognized families. In contradiction to previous DNA–hybridization studies, our analyses suggest paraphyly of suboscine passerines because the suboscine New Zealand wren Acanthisitta was found to be sister to all other passerines. Additionally, we reconstructed the parvorder Corvida as a basal paraphyletic grade within the oscine passerines. Finally, we found strong evidence that several family–level taxa are misplaced in the hybridization results, including the Alaudidae, Irenidae, and Melanocharitidae. The hypothesis of relationships we present here suggests that the oscine passerines arose on the Australian continental plate while it was isolated by oceanic barriers and that a major northern radiation of oscines (i.e. the parvorder Passerida) originated subsequent to dispersal from the south.",

    "title": "Novel Role of T Cells and IL-6 (Interleukin-6) in Angiotensin II–Induced Microvascular Dysfunction",
    "abstract": "Hypertension is an established risk factor for subsequent cardiovascular diseases, with Ang II (angiotensin II) playing a major role in mediating thrombotic and inflammatory abnormalities. Although T cells and IL-6 (interleukin-6) play an important role in adaptive immune responses, little is known about their role(s) in the thromboinflammatory responses associated with Ang II. Here we show using intravital microscopy coupled with the light/dye injury model that Rag-1 deficient (Rag-1−/−) and IL-6 deficient (IL-6−/−) mice are afforded protection against Ang II–induced thrombosis. Blocking IL-6 receptors (using CD126 and gp130 antibodies) significantly diminished Ang II–mediated thrombosis and inflammatory cell recruitment in mice. Furthermore, the adoptive transfer of IL-6−/−-derived T cells into Rag-1−/− mice failed to accelerate Ang II–induced thrombosis compared with Rag-1−/− mice reconstituted with wild-type–derived T cells, suggesting T cell IL-6 mediates the thrombotic abnormalities associated Ang II hypertension. Interestingly, adoptive transfer of WT T cells into Rag-1−/−/Ang II mice resulted in increased numbers of immature platelets, which constitutes a more active platelet population, that is, prothrombotic and proinflammatory. To translate our in vivo findings, we used clinical samples to demonstrate that IL-6 also predisposes platelets to an interaction with collagen receptors, thereby increasing the propensity for platelets to aggregate and cause thrombosis. In summary, we provide compelling evidence for the involvement of IL-6, IL-6R, and T-cell–dependent IL-6 signaling in Ang II–induced thromboinflammation, which may provide new therapeutic possibilities for drug discovery programs for the management of hypertension.",

    "title": "Suppression of Lysosome Function Induces Autophagy via a Feedback Down-regulation of MTOR Complex 1 (MTORC1) Activity*",
    "abstract": "Background: Lysosomes are required for autophagic degradation, which can be suppressed by lysosome inhibitors. Results: Inhibition of lysosome function resulted in autophagy activation via down-regulation of MTORC1. Conclusion: Lysosomes can affect autophagy initiation in addition to its role in autophagy degradation. Significance: The finding expands lysosome function to include regulation of autophagy activation and indicates a dual effect of lysosome inhibitors in autophagy. Autophagy can be activated via MTORC1 down-regulation by amino acid deprivation and by certain chemicals such as rapamycin, torin, and niclosamide. Lysosome is the degrading machine for autophagy but has also been linked to MTORC1 activation through the Rag/RRAG GTPase pathway. This association raises the question of whether lysosome can be involved in the initiation of autophagy. Toward this end, we found that niclosamide, an MTORC1 inhibitor, was able to inhibit lysosome degradation and increase lysosomal permeability. Niclosamide was ineffective in inhibiting MTORC1 in cells expressing constitutively activated Rag proteins, suggesting that its inhibitory effects were targeted to the Rag-MTORC1 signaling system. This places niclosamide in the same category of bafilomycin A1 and concanamycin A, inhibitors of the vacuolar H+-ATPase, for its dependence on Rag GTPase in suppression of MTORC1. Surprisingly, classical lysosome inhibitors such as chloroquine, E64D, and pepstatin A were also able to inhibit MTORC1 in a Rag-dependent manner. These lysosome inhibitors were able to activate early autophagy events represented by ATG16L1 and ATG12 puncta formation. Our work established a link between the functional status of the lysosome in general to the Rag-MTORC1 signaling axis and autophagy activation. Thus, the lysosome is not only required for autophagic degradation but also affects autophagy activation. Lysosome inhibitors can have a dual effect in suppressing autophagy degradation and in initiating autophagy.",

    "title": "Robot-Assisted Gastrectomy With Lymph Node Dissection for Gastric Cancer: Lessons Learned From an Initial 100 Consecutive Procedures",
    "abstract": "Objective:To evaluate the technical feasibility, effectiveness, and safety of robot-assisted gastrectomy (RAG) with lymphadenectomy, using the da Vinci system through analyses of our initial series of 100 consecutive patients. Summary Background Data:The application of robotic surgery was proven to be one of the best cutting-edge technologies for successful minimally invasive surgery by providing solutions to the many drawbacks of laparoscopic surgery, yet few reports have studied robotic surgery in gastric cancer. Methods:A review of a prospectively designed database at our institute from July 2005 to October 2007 revealed a series of 100 consecutive RAG patients with a preoperative diagnosis of early gastric cancer. Clinicopathologic characteristics and surgical outcomes were analyzed. Results:All operations were performed successfully without open or laparoscopic conversion. There were 33 total gastrectomies and 67 subtotal gastrectomies with D1+&bgr; or extended lymphadenectomy (D2). The mean total operation time and console time were 231 and 150 minutes, respectively. There were 13 postoperative morbidities and 1 postoperative mortality. The first flatus was noted on postoperative day 2.9, soft diet was started on postoperative day 4.2, and the mean postoperative hospital stay was 7.8 days. Although all patients were diagnosed as early gastric cancer preoperatively, the final pathology report revealed that 19 patients exhibited a depth deeper than T2. The mean number of retrieved lymph nodes was 36.7 (range, 11–83). None of the specimens showed microscopic tumor involvement in the resection line. Conclusions:This study demonstrated that RAG with lymphadenectomy can be applied safely and effectively for patients with gastric cancer.",

    "abstract": "Zoogeographic, palaeontological and biochemical data support a Southern Hemisphere origin for passerine birds, while accumulating molecular data suggest that most extant avian orders originated in the mid–Late Cretaceous. We obtained DNA sequence data from the nuclear c–myc and RAG–1 genes of the major passerine groups and here we demonstrate that the endemic New Zealand wrens (Acanthisittidae) are the sister taxon to all other extant passerines, supporting a Gondwanan origin and early radiation of passerines. We propose that (i) the acanthisittids were isolated when New Zealand separated from Gondwana (ca. 82–85 Myr ago), (ii) suboscines, in turn, were derived from an ancestral lineage that inhabited western Gondwana, and (iii) the ancestors of the oscines (songbirds) were subsequently isolated by the separation of Australia from Antarctica. The later spread of passerines into the Northern Hemisphere reflects the northward migration of these former Gondwanan elements.",

    "title": "Regulatory T cells reduce acute lung injury fibroproliferation by decreasing fibrocyte recruitment.",
    "abstract": "Acute lung injury (ALI) causes significant morbidity and mortality. Fibroproliferation in ALI results in worse outcomes, but the mechanisms governing fibroproliferation remain poorly understood. Regulatory T cells (Tregs) are important in lung injury resolution. Their role in fibroproliferation is unknown. We sought to identify the role of Tregs in ALI fibroproliferation, using a murine model of lung injury. Wild-type (WT) and lymphocyte-deficient Rag-1(-/-) mice received intratracheal LPS. Fibroproliferation was characterized by histology and the measurement of lung collagen. Lung fibrocytes were measured by flow cytometry. To dissect the role of Tregs in fibroproliferation, Rag-1(-/-) mice received CD4(+)CD25(+) (Tregs) or CD4(+)CD25(-) Tcells (non-Tregs) at the time of LPS injury. To define the role of the chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 12 (CXCL12)-CXCR4 pathway in ALI fibroproliferation, Rag-1(-/-) mice were treated with the CXCR4 antagonist AMD3100 to block fibrocyte recruitment. WT and Rag-1(-/-) mice demonstrated significant collagen deposition on Day 3 after LPS. WT mice exhibited the clearance of collagen, but Rag-1(-/-) mice developed persistent fibrosis. This fibrosis was mediated by the sustained epithelial expression of CXCL12 (or stromal cell-derived factor 1 [SDF-1]) that led to increased fibrocyte recruitment. The adoptive transfer of Tregs resolved fibroproliferation by decreasing CXCL12 expression and subsequent fibrocyte recruitment. Blockade of the CXCL12-CXCR4 axis with AMD3100 also decreased lung fibrocytes and fibroproliferation. These results indicate a central role for Tregs in the resolution of ALI fibroproliferation by reducing fibrocyte recruitment along the CXCL12-CXCR4 axis. A dissection of the role of Tregs in ALI fibroproliferation may inform the design of new therapeutic tools for patients with ALI.",

    "abstract": "Introduction Obesity is a major cause of morbidity and mortality resulting in pathologic changes in virtually every organ system. Although the cardiovascular system has been a focus of intense study, the effects of obesity on the lymphatic system remain essentially unknown. The purpose of this study was to identify the pathologic consequences of diet induced obesity (DIO) on the lymphatic system. Methods Adult male wild-type or RAG C57B6-6J mice were fed a high fat (60%) or normal chow diet for 8–10 weeks followed by analysis of lymphatic transport capacity. In addition, we assessed migration of dendritic cells (DCs) to local lymph nodes, lymph node architecture, and lymph node cellular make up. Results High fat diet resulted in obesity in both wild-type and RAG mice and significantly impaired lymphatic fluid transport and lymph node uptake; interestingly, obese wild-type but not obese RAG mice had significantly impaired migration of DCs to the peripheral lymph nodes. Obesity also resulted in significant changes in the macro and microscopic anatomy of lymph nodes as reflected by a marked decrease in size of inguinal lymph nodes (3.4-fold), decreased number of lymph node lymphatics (1.6-fold), loss of follicular pattern of B cells, and dysregulation of CCL21 expression gradients. Finally, obesity resulted in a significant decrease in the number of lymph node T cells and increased number of B cells and macrophages. Conclusions Obesity has significant negative effects on lymphatic transport, DC cell migration, and lymph node architecture. Loss of T and B cell inflammatory reactions does not protect from impaired lymphatic fluid transport but preserves DC migration capacity. Future studies are needed to determine how the interplay between diet, obesity, and the lymphatic system modulate systemic complications of obesity.",

    "title": "Amino acid signaling in TOR activation.",
    "abstract": "The target of rapamycin (TOR) is a central cell growth regulator conserved from yeast to mammals. Uncontrolled TOR activation is commonly observed in human cancers. TOR forms two distinct structural and functional complexes, TORC1 and TORC2. TORC1 promotes cell growth and cell size by stimulating protein synthesis. A wide range of signals, including nutrients, energy levels, and growth factors, are known to control TORC1 activity. Among them, amino acids (AA) not only potently activate TORC1 but are also required for TORC1 activation by other stimuli, such as growth factors. The mechanisms of growth factors and cellular energy status in activating TORC1 have been well elucidated, whereas the molecular basis of AA signaling is just emerging. Recent advances in the role of AA signaling on TORC1 activation have revealed key components, including the Rag GTPases, protein kinases, nutrient transporters, and the intracellular trafficking machinery, in relaying AA signals to TORC1 activation.",

    "title": "Peripheral T Cell Survival Requires Continual Ligation of the T Cell Receptor to Major Histocompatibility Complex–Encoded Molecules",
    "abstract": "In the thymus, T cells are selected according to their T cell receptor (TCR) specificity. After positive selection, mature cells are exported from primary lymphoid organs to seed the secondary lymphoid tissue. An important question is whether survival of mature T cells is an intrinsic property or requires continuous survival signals, i.e., engagement of the TCR by major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules in the periphery, perhaps in a similar way as occurring during thymic positive selection. To address this issue we used recombination-activating gene (Rag)-deficient H-2b mice expressing a transgenic TCR restricted by I-Ed class II MHC molecules. After engraftment with Rag−/− H-2d fetal thymi, CD4+8− peripheral T cells emerged. These cells were isolated and transferred into immunodeficient hosts of H-2b or H-2d haplotype, some of the latter being common cytokine receptor γ chain deficient to exclude rejection of H-2b donor cells by host natural killer cells. Our results show that in the absence, but not in the presence, of selecting MHC molecules, peripheral mature T cells are short lived and disappear within 7 wk, indicating that continuous contact of the TCR with selecting MHC molecules is required for survival of T cells.",

    "title": "Stable gene transfer and expression of human blood coagulation factor IX after intramuscular injection of recombinant adeno-associated virus.",
    "abstract": "We sought to determine whether intramuscular injection of a recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV) vector expressing human factor IX (hF.IX) could direct expression of therapeutic levels of the transgene in experimental animals. High titer (10(12)-10(13) vector genomes/ml) rAAV expressing hF.IX was prepared, purified, and injected into hindlimb muscles of C57BL/6 mice and Rag 1 mice. In the immunocompetent C57BL/6 mice, immunofluorescence staining of muscle harvested 3 months after injection demonstrated the presence of hF.IX protein, and PCR analysis of muscle DNA was positive for AAV DNA, but no hF.IX was detected in mouse plasma. Further studies showed that these mice had developed circulating antibodies to hF.IX. In follow-up experiments in Rag 1 mice, which carry a mutation in the recombinase activating gene-1 and thus lack functional B and T cells, similar results were seen on DNA analysis of muscle, but these mice also demonstrated therapeutic levels (200-350 ng/ml) of F. IX in the plasma. The time course of F.IX expression demonstrates that levels gradually increase over a period of several weeks before reaching a plateau that is stable 6 months after injection. In other experiments we demonstrate colocalization of hF.IX and collagen IV in intersitial spaces between muscle fibers. Collagen IV has recently been identified as a F.IX-binding protein; this finding explains the unusual pattern of immunofluorescent staining for F.IX shown in these experiments. Thus rAAV can be used to direct stable expression of therapeutic levels of F.IX after intramuscular injection and is a feasible strategy for treatment of patients with hemophilia B.",

    "title": "Epigenetic Regulation of Sensory Axon Regeneration after Spinal Cord Injury",
    "abstract": "Axon regeneration is hindered by a decline of intrinsic axon growth capability in mature neurons. Reversing this decline is associated with the induction of a large repertoire of regeneration-associated genes (RAGs), but the underlying regulatory mechanisms of the transcriptional changes are largely unknown. Here, we establish a correlation between diminished axon growth potential and histone 4 (H4) hypoacetylation. When neurons are triggered into a growth state, as in the conditioning lesion paradigm, H4 acetylation is restored, and RAG transcription is initiated. We have identified a set of target genes of Smad1, a proregenerative transcription factor, in conditioned DRG neurons. We also show that, during the epigenetic reprogramming process, histone-modifying enzymes work together with Smad1 to facilitate transcriptional regulation of RAGs. Importantly, targeted pharmacological modulation of the activity of histone-modifying enzymes, such as histone deacetylases, leads to induction of multiple RAGs and promotion of sensory axon regeneration in a mouse model of spinal cord injury. Our findings suggest epigenetic modulation as a potential therapeutic strategy to enhance axon regeneration.",

    "title": "Overexpression of ATF3 or the combination of ATF3, c-Jun, STAT3 and Smad1 promotes regeneration of the central axon branch of sensory neurons but without synergistic effects.",
    "abstract": "Peripheral nerve injury results in the activation of a number of transcription factors (TFs) in injured neurons, some of which may be key regulators of the regeneration-associated gene (RAG) programme. Among known RAG TFs, ATF3, Smad1, STAT3 and c-Jun have all been linked to successful axonal regeneration and have known functional and physical interactions. We hypothesised that TF expression would promote regeneration of the central axon branch of DRG neurons in the absence of a peripheral nerve lesion and that simultaneous overexpression of multiple RAG TFs would lead to greater effects than delivery of a single TF. Using adeno-associated viral vectors, we overexpressed either the combination of ATF3, Smad1, STAT3 and c-Jun with farnesylated GFP (fGFP), ATF3 only with fGFP, or fGFP only, in DRG neurons and assessed axonal regeneration after dorsal root transection or dorsal column injury and functional improvement after dorsal root injury. ATF3 alone and the combination of TFs promoted faster regeneration in the injured dorsal root. Surprisingly, however, the combination did not perform better than ATF3 alone. Neither treatment was able to induce functional improvement on sensory tests after dorsal root injury or promote regeneration in a dorsal column injury model. The lack of synergistic effects among these factors indicates that while they do increase the speed of axon growth, there may be functional redundancy between these TFs. Because axon growth is considerably less than that seen after a conditioning lesion, it appears these TFs do not induce the full regeneration programme.",

    "title": "Glycaemic index of cereal products explained by their content of rapidly and slowly available glucose",
    "abstract": "Elucidating the role of carbohydrate quality in human nutrition requires a greater understanding of how the physico-chemical characteristics of foods relate to their physiological properties. It was hypothesised that rapidly available glucose (RAG) and slowly available glucose (SAG), in vitro measures describing the rate of glucose release from foods, are the main determinants of glycaemic index (GI) and insulinaemic index (II) for cereal products. Twenty-three products (five breakfast cereals, six bakery products and crackers, and twelve biscuits) had their GI and II values determined, and were characterised by their fat, protein, starch and sugar contents, with the carbohydrate fraction further divided into total fructose, RAG, SAG and resistant starch. Relationships between these characteristics and GI and II values were investigated by regression analysis. The cereal products had a range of GI (28–93) and II (61–115) values, which were positively correlated (r2 0·22, P<0·001). The biscuit group, which had the highest SAG content (8·6 (sd 3·7) g per portion) due to the presence of ungelatinised starch, was found to have the lowest GI value (51 (sd 14)). There was no significant association between GI and either starch or sugar, while RAG was positively (r2 0·54, P<0·001) and SAG was negatively (r2 0·63, P<0·001) correlated with GI. Fat was correlated with GI (r2 0·52, P<0·001), and combined SAG and fat accounted for 73·1 % of the variance in GI, with SAG as the dominant variable. RAG and protein together contributed equally in accounting for 45·0 % of the variance in II. In conclusion, the GI and II values of the cereal products investigated can be explained by the RAG and SAG contents. A high SAG content identifies low-GI foods that are rich in slowly released carbohydrates for which health benefits have been proposed.",

    "title": "Repopulation of mouse liver with human hepatocytes and in vivo infection with hepatitis B virus",
    "abstract": "Mice containing livers repopulated with human hepatocytes would provide excellent in vivo models for studies on human liver diseases and hepatotropic viruses, for which no permissive cell lines exist. Here, we report partial repopulation of the liver of immunodeficient urokinase‐type plasminogen activator (uPA)/recombinant activation gene‐2 (RAG‐2) mice with normal human hepatocytes isolated from the adult liver. In the transplanted mice, the production of human albumin was demonstrated, indicating that human hepatocytes remained functional in the mouse liver for at least 2 months after transplantation. Inoculation of transplanted mice with human hepatitis B virus (HBV) led to the establishment of productive HBV infection. According to human‐specific genomic DNA analysis and immunostaining of cryostat liver sections, human hepatocytes were estimated to constitute up to 15% of the uPA/RAG‐2 mouse liver. This is proof that normal human hepatocytes can integrate into the mouse hepatic parenchyma, undergo multiple cell divisions, and remain permissive for a human hepatotropic virus in a xenogenic liver. This system will provide new opportunities for studies on etiology and therapy of viral and nonviral human liver diseases, as well as on hepatocyte biology and hepatocellular transplantation.

    "title": "Identification of novel lymphoid tissues in murine intestinal mucosa where clusters of c-kit+ IL-7R+ Thy1+ lympho-hemopoietic progenitors develop",
    "abstract": "We have revealed that about one and a half thousand tiny clusters, filled with one thousand closely packed lymphocytes, can be found throughout the murine small and large intestinal mucosa. They are located in crypt lamina propria (cryptopatches; CP) and can be first detected at 14-17 d after birth. A large fraction of lymphocytes in CP expresses c-kit, IL-7R, Thy1 and a lymphocyte function-associated antigen, LFA-1, whereas most of them remain CD3-, TCR alpha beta-, TCR gamma delta-, sIgM-, and B220-. The population size of IL-2R alpha+, HSA+ and Pgp-1+ subsets is variable (20-50%) and the composition of CD8+, Ly-1+, and CD4+ subsets is smaller but also variable (3-20%). In the small intestine, CP do not contain cells undergoing apoptosis nor cells bearing RAG-1 molecules, but do contain dendritic stromal cells bearing CD11c/CD18 molecules. The frequency of DNA replicating cells in CP is higher than that in Peyer's patches (PP), is lower than that in the thymic cortex and is almost comparable with that in the thymic medulla. The numbers of CP remain the same in aged mice (> 114 wk) but double after estrogen treatment even though the thymi are attenuated sharply in both conditions. Thus, with respect to histogenesis, lymphocyte composition and tissue level of cellular behavior, neither PP, isolated lymphoid follicles, peripheral LNs, nor thymus are identical with CP. Finally, CP are virtually absent in lamina propria of IL-7R-deficient mice that display a profound reduction in thymic and peripheral lymphoid cellularity. By contrast, CP are present in germ- free mice and in athymic (nu/nu), SCID, TCR beta x delta-/-, RAG-2-/-, PP-deficient (aly/aly), stem cell factor (Sl/Sld) and c-kit (W/Wv) mutant mice. Taking all of these results together, CP are the first identification of gut-associated murine lymphoid tissues where the generation of IL-7-dependent lympho-hematopoietic progenitors for T and/or B cell descendants may start to take place at the age of commencement of weaning.",

    "title": "Fundamental signals that regulate eosinophil homing to the gastrointestinal tract.",
    "abstract": "The histological identification of increased eosinophils in the gastrointestinal tract occurs in numerous clinical disorders; however, there is a limited understanding of the mechanisms regulating eosinophil trafficking into this mucosal surface. The results presented in this study characterize the processes regulating eosinophil homing into the gastrointestinal tract at baseline. Eosinophils were found to be present in the lamina propria of 19-day-old embryos and germ-free adult mice at concentrations comparable to those present in non-germ-free adult mice. Furthermore, eosinophil gastrointestinal levels were not altered by increasing circulating eosinophils after pulmonary allergen challenge. Gastrointestinal eosinophil levels were partially reduced in mice deficient in recombinase activating gene-1 (RAG-1), IL-5, or the beta common chain (betac), but these reductions paralleled reductions in circulating eosinophils. In contrast, mice deficient in eotaxin had a marked reduction in gastrointestinal eosinophils but normal levels of eosinophils in the hematopoietic compartments. Furthermore, eotaxin was important for regulating eosinophil levels, even in the presence of high levels of IL-5. These investigations demonstrate eosinophil homing into the gastrointestinal tract during embryonic development occurring independently of viable intestinal flora. Furthermore, eotaxin is identified as the primary regulator of eosinophil gastrointestinal homing under homeostatic states, and may therefore have a fundamental role in innate immune responses.",

    "abstract": "53BP1 participates early in the DNA damage response and is involved in cell cycle checkpoint control. Moreover, the phenotype of mice and cells deficient in 53BP1 suggests a defect in DNA repair (Ward et al., 2003b). Therefore, we asked whether or not 53BP1 would be required for the efficient repair of DNA double strand breaks. Our data indicate that homologous recombination by gene conversion does not depend on 53BP1. Moreover, 53BP1-deficient mice support normal V(D)J recombination, indicating that 53BP1 is not required for “classic” nonhomologous end joining. However, class switch recombination is severely impaired in the absence of 53BP1, suggesting that 53BP1 facilitates DNA end joining in a way that is not required or redundant for the efficient closing of RAG-induced strand breaks. These findings are similar to those observed in mice or cells deficient in the tumor suppressors ATM and H2AX, further suggesting that the functions of ATM, H2AX, and 53BP1 are closely linked.",

    "title": "A modified tetracycline-regulated system provides autoregulatory, inducible gene expression in cultured cells and transgenic mice.",
    "abstract": "A system for tetracycline-regulated inducible gene expression was described recently which relies on constitutive expression of a tetracycline-controlled transactivator (tTA) fusion protein combining the tetracycline repressor and the transcriptional activation domain of VP16 [Gossen, M. & Bujard, H. (1992) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 89, 5547-5551]. This system yielded only low levels of transactivator protein, probably because tTA is toxic. To avoid this difficulty, we placed the tTA gene under the control of the inducible promoter to which tTA binds, making expression of tTA itself inducible and autoregulatory. When used to drive expression of the recombination activating genes 1 and 2 (RAG-1 and RAG-2), the autoregulatory system yielded both substantially higher levels of variable (diversity) joining [V(D)J] recombination activity (70-fold on average) and inducible expression in a much larger fraction of transfected cells (autoregulatory, 90%, vs. constitutive, 18%). In addition, this system allowed the creation of transgenic mice in which expression of a luciferase transgene was inducible tens to hundreds of times the basal levels in most tissues examined. Induced levels of expression were highest in thymus and lung and appear to be substantially higher than in previously reported inducible luciferase transgenic mice created with the constitutive system. With the modified system, inducible transactivator mRNA and protein were easily detected in cell lines by RNA and Western blotting, and transactivator mRNA was detected by RNA blotting in some tissues of transgenic mice. This autoregulatory system represents an improved strategy for tetracycline-regulated gene expression both in cultured cells and in transgenic animals.",

    "title": "Sex Differences in T-Lymphocyte Tissue Infiltration and Development of Angiotensin II Hypertension",
    "abstract": "There is extensive evidence that activation of the immune system is both necessary and required for the development of angiotensin II (Ang II)–induced hypertension in males. The purpose of this study was to determine whether sex differences exist in the ability of the adaptive immune system to induce Ang II–dependent hypertension and whether central and renal T-cell infiltration during Ang II–induced hypertension is sex dependent. Recombinant activating gene-1 (Rag-1)–/– mice, lacking both T and B cells, were used. Male and female Rag-1–/– mice received adoptive transfer of male CD3+ T cells 3 weeks before 14-day Ang II infusion (490 ng/kg per minute). Blood pressure was monitored via tail cuff. In the absence of T cells, systolic blood pressure responses to Ang II were similar between sexes (&Dgr;22.1 mm Hg males versus &Dgr;18 mm Hg females). After adoptive transfer of male T cells, Ang II significantly increased systolic blood pressure in males (&Dgr;37.7 mm Hg; P<0.05) when compared with females (&Dgr;13.7 mm Hg). Flow cytometric analysis of total T cells and CD4+, CD8+, and regulatory Foxp3+-CD4+ T-cell subsets identified that renal lymphocyte infiltration was significantly increased in males versus females in both control and Ang II–infused animals (P<0.05). Immunohistochemical staining for CD3+-positive T cells in the subfornical organ region of the brain was increased in males when compared with that in females. These results suggest that female Rag-1–/– mice are protected from male T-cell–mediated increases in Ang II–induced hypertension when compared with their male counterparts, and this protection may involve sex differences in the magnitude of T-cell infiltration of the kidney and brain.",

    "title": "Alternative Activation Is an Innate Response to Injury That Requires CD4+ T Cells to be Sustained during Chronic Infection1",
    "abstract": "Alternatively activated macrophages (AAMΦ) are found in abundance during chronic Th2 inflammatory responses to metazoan parasites. Important roles for these macrophages are being defined, particularly in the context of Th2-mediated pathology and fibrosis. However, a full understanding of the requirements for alternative activation, particularly at the innate level, is lacking. We present evidence that alternative activation by the Th2 cytokines IL-4 and IL-13 is an innate and rapid response to tissue injury that takes place even in the absence of an infectious agent. This early response does not require CD4+ Th2 cells because it occurred in RAG-deficient mice. However, class II-restricted CD4+ T cell help is essential to maintain AAMΦ in response to infection, because AAMΦ were absent in RAG-deficient and MHC class II-deficient, but not B cell-deficient mice after chronic exposure to the nematode parasite, Brugia malayi. The absence of AAMΦ was associated with increased neutrophilia and reduced eosinophilia, suggesting that AAMΦ are involved in the clearance of neutrophils as well as the recruitment of eosinophils. Consistent with this hypothesis, AAMΦ show enhanced phagocytosis of apoptotic neutrophils, but not latex beads. Our data demonstrate that alternative activation by type 2 cytokines is an innate response to injury that can occur in the absence of an adaptive response. However, analogous to classical activation by microbial pathogens, Th2 cells are required for maintenance and full activation during the ongoing response to metazoan parasites.",

    "title": "Importance of Agility Performance in Professional Futsal Players; Reliability and Applicability of Newly Developed Testing Protocols",
    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to determine the inter- and intra-testing reliability of newly developed tests of the change of direction speed (CODS) and reactive agility (RAG) in competitive futsal players. Additionally, the developed tests were evaluated for their validity with regard to the differentiation of two performance-levels. Thirty-two professional male futsal players (age = 26.22 ± 5.22 years; body height = 182.13 ± 5.99 cm, body mass = 77.43 ± 8.00 kg) participated in the study. The sample was divided into two groups based on their level of futsal performance: A top-level-group (n = 12) and a team-level-group (n = 20). The variables included body height, mass, body mass index, a sprint over a 10-m distance (S10M), and eight newly developed futsal specific CODS and RAG tests. The CODS and RAG tests were performed by dribbling the balls (CODS_D and RAG_D) and without dribbling (CODS_T and RAG_T), and the performances on the dominant and non-dominant sides were observed separately. All CODS, and RAG tests performed on dominant side and RAG_T tests performed on the non-dominant side had good inter-testing (CV = 5–8%; ICC = 0.76–0.89) and intra-testing (CV = 4–9%; ICC = 0.77–0.91) reliability. However, RAG_D performed on the non-dominant side was not reliable (ICC = 0.60, CV = 10%). The top-level-players outperformed the team-level-players in the CODS and RAG tests that involved dribbling (t-test: 4.28 and 2.40, p < 0.05; effect sizes (ES): 0.81 and 1.5, respectively), while the team-level players achieved better results in the CODS_T (t-test: 2.08, p < 0.05; ES: 0.60). The proposed CODS and RAG tests that involved dribbling over a 3.2-m distance, especially on the dominant side, appeared to be reliable, as well as valid for distinguishing the performance level in futsal players.",

    "title": "Gtr/Ego-independent TORC1 activation is achieved through a glutamine-sensitive interaction with Pib2 on the vacuolar membrane",
    "abstract": "TORC1 is a central regulator of cell growth in response to amino acids. The role of the evolutionarily conserved Gtr/Rag pathway in the regulation of TORC1 is well-established. Recent genetic studies suggest that an additional regulatory pathway, depending on the activity of Pib2, plays a role in TORC1 activation independently of the Gtr/Rag pathway. However, the interplay between the Pib2 pathway and the Gtr/Rag pathway remains unclear. In this study, we show that Pib2 and Gtr/Ego form distinct complexes with TORC1 in a mutually exclusive manner, implying dedicated functional relationships between TORC1 and Pib2 or Gtr/Rag in response to specific amino acids. Furthermore, simultaneous depletion of Pib2 and the Gtr/Ego system abolishes TORC1 activity and completely compromises the vacuolar localization of TORC1. Thus, the amino acid-dependent activation of TORC1 is achieved through the Pib2 and Gtr/Ego pathways alone. Finally, we show that glutamine induces a dose-dependent increase in Pib2-TORC1 complex formation, and that glutamine binds directly to the Pib2 complex. These data provide strong preliminary evidence for Pib2 functioning as a putative glutamine sensor in the regulation of TORC1.",

    "abstract": "CCR9 mediates chemotaxis in response to CCL25/thymus-expressed chemokine and is selectively expressed on T cells in the thymus and small intestine. To investigate the role of CCR9 in T cell development, the CCR9 gene was disrupted by homologous recombination. B cell development, thymic αβ-T cell development, and thymocyte selection appeared unimpaired in adult CCR9-deficient (CCR9−/−) mice. However, competitive transplantation experiments revealed that bone marrow from CCR9−/− mice was less efficient at repopulating the thymus of lethally irradiated Rag-1−/− mice than bone marrow from littermate CCR9+/+ mice. CCR9−/− mice had increased numbers of peripheral γδ-T cells but reduced numbers of γδTCR+ and CD8αβ+αβTCR+ intraepithelial lymphocytes in the small intestine. Thus, CCR9 plays an important, although not indispensable, role in regulating the development and/or migration of both αβ− and γδ− T lymphocytes.",

    "title": "Regulation of Experimental Autoimmune Encephalomyelitis by Natural Killer (NK) Cells",
    "abstract": "In this report, we establish a regulatory role of natural killer (NK) cells in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a prototype T helper cell type 1 (Th1)-mediated disease. Active sensitization of C57BL/6 (B6) mice with the myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG)35-55 peptide induces a mild form of monophasic EAE. When mice were deprived of NK cells by antibody treatment before immunization, they developed a more serious form of EAE associated with relapse. Aggravation of EAE by NK cell deletion was also seen in β2-microglobulin−/− (β2m−/−) mice, indicating that NK cells can play a regulatory role in a manner independent of CD8+ T cells or NK1.1+ T cells (NK–T cells). The disease enhancement was associated with augmentation of T cell proliferation and production of Th1 cytokines in response to MOG35-55. EAE passively induced by the MOG35-55-specific T cell line was also enhanced by NK cell deletion in B6, β2m−/−, and recombination activation gene 2 (RAG-2)−/− mice, indicating that the regulation by NK cells can be independent of T, B, or NK–T cells. We further showed that NK cells inhibit T cell proliferation triggered by antigen or cytokine stimulation. Taken together, we conclude that NK cells are an important regulator for EAE in both induction and effector phases.",

    "title": "Neuroinflammation after Traumatic Brain Injury Is Enhanced in Activating Transcription Factor 3 Mutant Mice.",
    "abstract": "Traumatic brain injury (TBI) induces a neuroinflammatory response resulting in astrocyte and microglia activation at the lesion site. This involves upregulation of neuroinflammatory genes, including chemokines and interleukins. However, so far, there is lack of knowledge on transcription factors (TFs) modulating this TBI-associated gene expression response. Herein, we analyzed activating transcription factor 3 (ATF3), a TF encoding a regeneration-associated gene (RAG) predominantly studied in peripheral nervous system (PNS) injury. ATF3 contributes to PNS axon regeneration and was shown before to regulate inflammatory processes in other injury models. In contrast to PNS injury, data on ATF3 in central nervous system (CNS) injury are sparse. We used Atf3 mouse mutants and a closed-head weight-drop-based TBI model in adult mice to target the rostrolateral cortex resulting in moderate injury severity. Post-TBI, ATF3 was upregulated already at early time points (i.e,. 1-4 h) post-injury in the brain. Mortality and weight loss upon TBI were slightly elevated in Atf3 mutants. ATF3 deficiency enhanced TBI-induced paresis and hematoma formation, suggesting that ATF3 limits these injury outcomes in wild-type mice. Next, we analyzed TBI-associated RAG and inflammatory gene expression in the cortical impact area. In contrast to the PNS, only some RAGs (Atf3, Timp1, and Sprr1a) were induced by TBI, and, surprisingly, some RAG encoding neuropeptides were downregulated. Notably, we identified ATF3 as TF-regulating proneuroinflammatory gene expression, including CCL and CXCL chemokines (Ccl2, Ccl3, Ccl4, and Cxcl1) and lipocalin. In Atf3 mutant mice, mRNA abundance was further enhanced upon TBI compared to wild-type mice, suggesting immune gene repression by wild-type ATF3. In accord, more immune cells were present in the lesion area of ATF3-deficient mice. Overall, we identified ATF3 as a new TF-mediating TBI-associated CNS inflammatory responses.",

    "abstract": "To study homeostasis of peripheral B lymphocytes in the absence of B cell influx from the bone marrow, we generated a mouse mutant in which the recombination-activating gene (RAG)-2 can be inducibly deleted. When RAG-2 was deleted at the age of 8–10 wk, splenic naive follicular B cells were gradually lost over a year of observation, with a half-life of ∼4.5 mo. By contrast, the pool of marginal zone B cells in the spleen and of B-1 cells in the peritoneal cavity were kept at normal level. In lymph nodes, ∼90% of the B cells were lost within 4 mo, and B cell numbers remained constant thereafter. Mice in which RAG-2 was deleted at birth maintained a small population of activated B cells with an increased proportion of marginal zone B cells. Additionally, an increase of the pool of IgM secreting cells and B-1a cells was observed.",

    "abstract": "Mice rendered deficient in the production of interleukin 10 (IL-10-/-) develop a chronic inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) that predominates in the colon and shares histopathological features with human IBD. Our aim was to identify which cell type(s) can mediate colitis in IL-10-/- mice. We detected an influx of immunoglobulin-positive cells into the colon and the presence of colon-reactive antibodies in the serum of IL- 10-/- mice. To assess a pathogenic role for B cells, we generated a B cell-deficient (B-/-) strain of IL-10-/- mice. B-/-IL-10-/- mice acquired a severe colitis analogous to that IL-10-/- mice, implying that B cells were not the primary mediator of IBD in this model. A series of cell transfer experiments was performed to assess a pathogenic role for T cells. When IL-10-/- T cell-enriched lamina propria lymphocytes (LPL) or intraepithelial lymphocytes (IEL) were transferred into immunodeficient recombinase-activating gene (RAG)-2-/- recipients, a mild to severe colitis developed, depending on the cell number transferred. Lymphocytes recovered from the colon of transplanted RAG-2-/- mice with colitis were predominantly alpha beta TCR+CD4+, including a large proportion of CD4+CD8 alpha + cells. These cells were also CD45RB-/low and CD44+, indicative of an activated/memory population. Individual populations of CD4+CD8 alpha-, CD4+CD8 alpha + and CD4-CD8 alpha + T cells were then isolated from the lamina propria compartment of IL-10-/- mice and transferred into RAG-2- /- recipients. Only IL-10-/- CD4-expressing LPL, including both the CD4+CD8 alpha- and CD4+CD8 alpha + populations, induced colitis in recipient mice. Interferon-gamma, but little to no IL-4, was produced by CD4+CD8 alpha- and CD4+CD8 alpha + LPL recovered from the inflamed colons of RAG-2-/- recipients implicating alpha T helper cell 1 (TH1)- mediated response. We thus conclude that colitis in IL-10-/- mice is predominantly mediated by TH1-type alpha beta TCR+ T cells expressing CD4 alone, or in combination with the CD8 alpha molecule.",

    "title": "Spontaneous Autoimmune Diabetes in Monoclonal T Cell Nonobese Diabetic Mice",
    "abstract": "It has been established that insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) in nonobese diabetic (NOD) mice results from a CD4+ and CD8+ T cell–dependent autoimmune process directed against the pancreatic beta cells. The precise roles that beta cell–reactive CD8+ and CD4+ T cells play in the disease process, however, remain ill defined. Here we have investigated whether naive beta cell–specific CD8+ and CD4+ T cells can spontaneously accumulate in pancreatic islets, differentiate into effector cells, and destroy beta cells in the absence of other T cell specificities. This was done by introducing Kd– or I-Ag7–restricted beta cell–specific T cell receptor (TCR) transgenes that are highly diabetogenic in NOD mice (8.3- and 4.1-TCR, respectively), into recombination-activating gene (RAG)-2–deficient NOD mice, which cannot rearrange endogenous TCR genes and thus bear monoclonal TCR repertoires. We show that while RAG-2−/− 4.1-NOD mice, which only bear beta cell–specific CD4+ T cells, develop diabetes as early and as frequently as RAG-2+ 4.1-NOD mice, RAG-2−/− 8.3-NOD mice, which only bear beta cell–specific CD8+ T cells, develop diabetes less frequently and significantly later than RAG-2+ 8.3-NOD mice. The monoclonal CD8+ T cells of RAG-2−/− 8.3-NOD mice mature properly, proliferate vigorously in response to antigenic stimulation in vitro, and can differentiate into beta cell–cytotoxic T cells in vivo, but do not efficiently accumulate in islets in the absence of a CD4+ T cell–derived signal, which can be provided by splenic CD4+ T cells from nontransgenic NOD mice. These results demonstrate that naive beta cell– specific CD8+ and CD4+ T cells can trigger diabetes in the absence of other T or B cell specificities, but suggest that efficient recruitment of naive diabetogenic beta cell–reactive CD8+ T cells to islets requires the assistance of beta cell–reactive CD4+ T cells.",

    "abstract": "To determine which CD3 components are required for early T cell development, we generated mice with a targeted mutation of the CD3‐epsilon gene and characterized their T cell populations relative to those found in CD3‐zeta/eta‐and recombinase activating gene (RAG)‐deficient mice. In the absence of intact CD3‐epsilon subunit, thymocytes do not progress beyond the CD44‐/lowCD25+ triple‐negative stage and appear to be arrested at the very same developmental control point as RAG‐deficient thymocytes. In contrast, the disruption of the CD3‐epsilon/eta gene does not totally abrogate the progression through this control point. CD3‐epsilon‐deficient thymocytes do rearrange their T cell receptor (TCR) beta gene segments and produce low levels of full‐length TCR beta transcripts. Taken together, these results establish an essential role for the CD3‐epsilon gene products during T cell development and further suggest that the CD3‐epsilon polypeptides start to exert their function as part of a pre‐TCR through which CD44‐/lowCD25+ triple‐negative cells monitor the occurrence of productive TCR beta gene rearrangements. Finally, the absence of intact CD3‐epsilon polypeptides had no discernible effect on the completion of TCR gamma and TCR delta gene rearrangements, emphasizing that they are probably not subjected to the same epigenetic controls as those operating on the expression of TCR alpha and beta genes.",

    "title": "Comprehensive mapping of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine epigenetic dynamics in axon regeneration",
    "abstract": "ABSTRACT In contrast to central nervous system neurons, dorsal root ganglia (DRG) neurons can switch to a regenerative state after peripheral axotomy. In a screen for chromatin regulators of the regenerative responses in this conditioning lesion paradigm, we identified Tet methylcytosine dioxygenase 3 (Tet3) as upregulated in DRG neurons, along with increased 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC). We generated genome-wide 5hmC maps in adult DRG, which revealed that peripheral and central axotomy (leading to no regenerative effect) triggered differential 5hmC changes that are associated with distinct signaling pathways. 5hmC was altered in a large set of regeneration-associated genes (RAGs), including well-known RAGs, such as Atf3, Bdnf, and Smad1, that regulate axon growth potential of DRG neurons, thus supporting its role for RAG regulation. Our analyses also predicted HIF-1, STAT, and IRF as potential transcription factors that may collaborate with Tet3 for 5hmC modifications. Intriguingly, central axotomy resulted in widespread 5hmC modifications that had little overlap with those of peripheral axotomy, thus potentially constituting a roadblock for regeneration. Our study revealed 5hmC dynamics as a previously unrecognized epigenetic mechanism underlying the divergent responses after axonal injury.",

    "title": "Interdependence of cortical thymic epithelial cell differentiation and T-lineage commitment.",
    "abstract": "Thymocyte and thymic epithelial cell (TEC) development are interdependent processes. Although lineage relationships among progressively maturing thymocyte subsets have been characterized, the developmental relationships among TEC subsets are obscure. Because epithelial cells express distinct keratin (K) species as a function of differentiation stage and proliferative status, we used K expression patterns to identify mouse TEC subsets and determine their lineage relationships. As expected, cortical and medullary TEC subsets express distinct K expression patterns in the normal thymus. However, we detected two distinct cortical TEC subsets, a major K8(+)K5(-) subset and a minor K8(+)K5(+) subset, which is highly represented at the cortico-medullary junction. Both cortical TEC subsets are also present in recombination activating gene 1 (RAG-1(-/-)) and TCRbetaxdelta-/- thymi in which T-cell development is blocked at the CD4(-)CD8(-)CD25(+)CD44(-) pre-T cell stage. In contrast, K8(+)K5(+) TECs predominate in the thymi of human CD3epsilon transgenic mice in which thymocyte development is blocked at an earlier CD4(-)CD8(-)CD25(-)CD44(+) stage. Transplantation of newborn human CD3epsilon transgenic thymi under the kidney capsule of RAG-1(-/-) mice results in the emergence of K8(+)K5(-) TECs concomitant with the appearance of CD25(+) thymocytes. Together, the data suggest that cortical TEC development proceeds from a K8(+)K5(+) precursor subset to a K8(+)K5(-) stage in a differentiation process concomitant with T-cell lineage commitment.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVES\nTo determine if apoptosis (programmed cell death) occurs systemically in lymphoid and parenchymal cells during sepsis. To examine the potential role of T and B cells in the apoptotic process using knockout mice deficient in mature T and B lymphocytes.\n\n\nDESIGN\nProspective, randomized, controlled trial.\n\n\nSETTING\nAnimal laboratory in a university medical setting.\n\n\nINTERVENTIONS\nCecal ligation and puncture (CLP) (n = 34) or sham surgery (n = 13) was performed in female ND4 mice and, 15 to 22 hrs postoperatively, thymus, lung, heart, spleen, ileum, colon, liver, kidney, brain, and muscle were obtained and examined for apoptosis. A second group of mice (Rag-1) which are totally deficient in mature T and B cells also underwent CLP (n = 14) or sham surgery (n = 14) and had examination of tissues for apoptosis.\n\n\nMEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS\nFour methods with varying sensitivities and specificities were used to detect apoptosis, including: a) DNA agarose gel electrophoresis; b) terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL); c) electron microscopy; and d) light microscopy. In CLP mice, multiple methods demonstrated apoptosis in lymphocytes in thymus, spleen, ileum, colon, lung, and skeletal muscle. In addition to lymphocytes, parenchymal cells in ileum, colon, lung, and to a lesser extent, in skeletal muscle and kidney were apoptotic in CLP mice. There was no evidence of apoptosis by any method of detection in liver, brain, or heart. Results in Rag-1 mice which are deficient in T and B cells demonstrated extensive apoptosis in thymus, spleen, and ileum with less degrees of apoptosis in colon and lung. Both lymphoid cells and parenchymal cells were apoptotic. Rag-1 mice which underwent CLP did not die prematurely and there were no apparent observable differences in the physical response (tachypnea, piloerection, lethargy, etc), or intra-abdominal bowel inflammation/adhesions compared with CLP mice with normal T and B cells.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nApoptosis is an important mechanism of cell death in lymphocytes and parenchymal cells in sepsis and occurs systemically in many organs. Apoptosis may be an important cause of immunologic suppression in sepsis by inducing widespread lymphocyte depletion. Alternately, apoptosis may be beneficial to host survival by down-regulating the inflammatory response which accompanies sepsis. The degree to which parenchymal cell apoptosis is contributing to multiple organ failure cannot be determined from the present study. Findings in Rag-1 mice demonstrate that mature T and B cells and their secretory products are not necessary for apoptosis to occur during sepsis and that apoptotic cell death is not restricted to T or B cells. Apoptosis may be a key regulator of the balance between the pro- and anti-inflammatory process.",

    "abstract": "The role of antibodies (Abs) in the development of chronic colitis in T cell receptor (TCR)-α−/− mice was explored by creating double mutant mice (TCR-α−/− × immunoglobulin (Ig)μ−/−), which lack B cells. TCR-α−/− × Igμ−/− mice spontaneously developed colitis at an earlier age, and the colitis was more severe than in TCR-α−/− mice. Colitis was induced in recombination-activating gene-1 (RAG-1−/−) mice by the transfer of mesenteric lymph node (MLN) cells from TCR-α−/− × Igμ−/− mice. When purified B cells from TCR-α−/− mice were mixed with MLN cells before cell transfer, colitis did not develop in RAG-1−/− mice. Administration of the purified Ig from TCR-α−/− mice and a mixture of monoclonal autoAbs reactive with colonic epithelial cells led to attenuation of colitis in TCR-α−/− × Igμ−/− mice. Apoptotic cells were increased in the colon, MLN, and spleen of TCR-α−/− × Igμ−/− mice as compared to Igμ−/− mice and TCR-α−/− mice. Administration of the purified Ig from TCR-α−/− mice into TCR-α−/− × Igμ−/− mice led to decrease in the number of apoptotic cells. These findings suggest that although B cells are not required for the initiation of colitis, B cells and Igs (autoAbs) can suppress colitis, presumably by affecting the clearance of apoptotic cells.",

    "abstract": "Manual handling of municipal solid waste is of serious concern owing to emerging occupational risks. Considering this, health risks of municipal solid waste workers involved in street sweeping, waste collection, waste processing and rag picking were assessed in Chandigarh, India, using an interview schedule as a study tool. Result shows that the waste worker profession is mainly dominated by males, except in rag pickers, and with a lower literacy rate. Age distribution shows that 16% of waste collectors and 11% of rag pickers were below 18 years of age. Daily income of the waste workers ranges from ₹100 to ₹200. It was observed that 22.2% of waste collectors, 43.2% of street sweepers and 25.5% of rag pickers do not use any type of protective gears owing to their casual attitude, which results in various types of injuries. The major occupational health issues reported by various categories of waste workers were respiratory disorders, injuries and allergies having prevalence of 12.3%–17.6%, 4.9%–44.4% and 35.3%–48.9%, respectively. Waste workers are vulnerable to occupational health hazards and hence there is a need to safeguard them through formulation of new laws and policies.",

    "title": "The immediate effects of robot-assistance on energy consumption and cardiorespiratory load during walking compared to walking without robot-assistance: a systematic review",
    "abstract": "Abstract Purpose: The integration of sufficient cardiovascular stress into robot-assisted gait (RAG) training could combine the benefits of both RAG and aerobic training. The aim was to summarize literature data on the immediate effects of RAG compared to walking without robot-assistance on metabolic-, cardiorespiratory- and fatigue-related parameters. Methods: PubMed and Web of Science were searched for eligible articles till February 2016. Means, SDs and significance values were extracted. Effect sizes were calculated. Results: Fourteen studies were included, concerning 155 participants (85 healthy subjects, 39 stroke and 31 spinal cord injury patients), 9 robots (2 end-effectors, 1 treadmill-based and 6 wearable exoskeletons), and 7 outcome parameters (mostly oxygen consumption and heart rate). Overall, metabolic and cardiorespiratory parameters were lower during RAG compared to walking without robot-assistance (moderate to large effect sizes). In healthy subjects, when no body-weight support (BWS) was provided, RAG with an end-effector device was more energy demanding than walking overground (p > .05, large effect sizes). Conclusions: Generally, results suggest that RAG is less energy-consuming and cardiorespiratory stressful than walking without robot-assistance, but results depend on factors such as robot type, walking speed, BWS and effort. Additional research is needed to draw firm conclusions. Implications for Rehabilitation Awareness of the energy consumption and cardiorespiratory load of robot-assisted gait (RAG) training is important in the rehabilitation of (neurological) patients with impaired cardiorespiratory fitness and patients who are at risk of cardiovascular diseases. On the other hand, the integration of sufficient cardiometabolic stress in RAG training could combine the effects of both RAG and aerobic training. Energy consumption and cardiorespiratory load during walking with robot-assistance seems to depend on factors such as robot type, walking speed, body-weight support or amount of effort. These parameters could be adjusted in RAG rehabilitation to make RAG more or less energy-consuming and cardiorespiratory stressful. Overall, short duration exoskeleton walking seems less energy-consuming and cardiorespiratory stressful than walking without robot-assistance. This might implicate that the exercise intensity is safe for (neurological) patients at risk of cardiovascular diseases. How this changes in extended walking time is unclear.",

    "abstract": "The target of rapamycin complex 1 (TORC1) regulates eukaryotic cell growth in response to a variety of input signals. In S. cerevisiae, amino acids activate TORC1 through the Rag guanosine triphosphatase (GTPase) heterodimer composed of Gtr1 and Gtr2 found together with Ego1 and Ego3 in the EGO complex (EGOC). The GTPase activity of Gtr1 is regulated by the SEA complex (SEAC). Specifically, SEACIT, a SEAC subcomplex containing Iml1, Npr2, and Npr3 functions as a GTPase activator (GAP) for Gtr1 to decrease the activity of TORC1 and, consequently, growth, after amino acid deprivation. Here, we present genetic epistasis data, which show that SEACAT, the other SEAC subcomplex, containing Seh1, Sea2–4, and Sec13, antagonizes the GAP function of SEACIT. Orthologs of EGOC (Ragulator), SEACIT (GATOR1), and SEACAT (GATOR2) are present in higher eukaryotes, highlighting the remarkable conservation, from yeast to man, of Rag GTPase and TORC1 regulation.",

    "abstract": "CD25+4+ regulatory T cells (Treg) play an indispensable role in preventing autoimmunity. Little is known, however, about the antigen specificities required for their development and effector functions. Mice transgenic for an anti-myelin basic protein (MBP) T cell antigen receptor (TCR) spontaneously develop experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) when deficient for the RAG-1 gene (T/R−), whereas RAG-1-competent transgenic animals (T/R+) remain healthy, protected by CD4+ Treg-expressing endogenous TCRs. We have now investigated the role and specificity of CD25+4+ Treg in this system. The results show that T/R+ animals contain MBP-specific suppressive CD25+4+ cells, whereas T/R− do not. Adoptive transfer of CD25+4+ cells from nontransgenic or T/R+ donors into T/R− mice prevented the development of EAE. Surprisingly, transfer of nontransgenic CD25+4+ cells purified from T/R+ donors conferred only a limited protection, possibly because of their restricted repertoire diversity that we demonstrate here. Absence of transgenic CD25+4+ cells in animals deficient for endogenous TCRα chains and analyses of endogenous TCR gene expression in subsets of CD4+ cells from T/R+ mice demonstrate that development of transgenic MBP-specific CD25+4+ Treg depends on the coexpression of endogenous TCRα chains. Taken together, these results indicate that specificity to MBP is required for effector functions but is not sufficient for thymic selection/commitment of CD25+4+ Treg preventing EAE.",

    "title": "Microbiota innate stimulation is a prerequisite for T cell spontaneous proliferation and induction of experimental colitis",
    "abstract": "Little is known about how the microbiota regulates T cell proliferation and whether spontaneous T cell proliferation is involved in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease. In this study, we show that stimulation of innate pathways by microbiota-derived ligands and antigen-specific T cell stimulation are both required for intestinal inflammation. Microbiota-derived ligands promoted spontaneous T cell proliferation by activating dendritic cells (DCs) to produce IL-6 via Myd88, as shown by the spontaneous proliferation of T cells adoptively transferred into specific pathogen–free (SPF) RAG−/− mice, but not in germfree RAG−/− mice. Reconstitution of germfree RAG−/− mice with cecal bacterial lysate–pulsed DCs, but not with IL-6−/− or Myd88−/− DCs, restored spontaneous T cell proliferation. CBir1 TCR transgenic (CBir1 Tg) T cells, which are specific for an immunodominant microbiota antigen, induced colitis in SPF RAG−/− mice. Blocking the spontaneous proliferation of CBir1 Tg T cells by co-transferring bulk OT II CD4+ T cells abrogated colitis development. Although transferred OT II T cells underwent spontaneous proliferation in RAG−/− mice, the recipients failed to develop colitis because of the lack of cognate antigen in the intestinal lumen. Collectively, our data demonstrate that induction of colitis requires both spontaneous proliferation of T cells driven by microbiota-derived innate signals and antigen-specific T cell proliferation.",

    "title": "Ku70 Is Required for Late B Cell Development and Immunoglobulin Heavy Chain Class Switching",
    "abstract": "Immunoglobulin (Ig) heavy chain (HC) class switch recombination (CSR) is a late B cell process that involves intrachromosomal DNA rearrangement. Ku70 and Ku80 form a DNA end-binding complex required for DNA double strand break repair and V(D)J recombination. Ku70−/− (K70T) mice, like recombination activating gene (RAG)-1– or RAG-2–deficient (R1T or R2T) mice, have impaired B and T cell development at an early progenitor stage, which is thought to result at least in part from defective V(D)J recombination (Gu, Y., K.J. Seidl, G.A. Rathbun, C. Zhu, J.P. Manis, N. van der Stoep, L. Davidson, H.L. Cheng, J.M. Sekiguchi, K. Frank, et al. 1997. Immunity. 7:653–665; Ouyang, H., A. Nussenzweig, A. Kurimasa, V.C. Soares, X. Li, C. Cordon-Cardo, W. Li, N. Cheong, M. Nussenzweig, G. Iliakis, et al. 1997. J. Exp. Med. 186:921–929). Therefore, to examine the potential role of Ku70 in CSR, we generated K70T mice that carry a germline Ig HC locus in which the JH region was replaced with a functionally rearranged VH(D)JH and Ig λ light chain transgene (referred to as K70T/HL mice). Previously, we have shown that B cells from R1T or R2T mice carrying these rearranged Ig genes (R1T/HL or R2T/HL mice) can undergo CSR to IgG isotypes (Lansford, R., J. Manis, E. Sonoda, K. Rajewsky, and F. Alt. 1998. Int. Immunol. 10:325–332). K70T/HL mice had significant numbers of peripheral surface IgM+ B cells, which generated serum IgM levels similar to those of R2T/HL mice. However, in contrast to R2T/HL mice, K70T/HL mice had no detectable serum IgG isotypes. In vitro culture of K70T/HL B cells with agents that induce CSR in normal or R2T/HL B cells did lead to the induction of germline CH transcripts, indicating that initial signaling pathways for CSR were intact in K70T/HL cells. However, treatment with such agents did not lead to detectable CSR by K70T/HL B cells, and instead, led to cell death within 72 h. We conclude that Ku70 is required for the generation of B cells that have undergone Ig HC class switching. Potential roles for Ku70 in the CSR process are discussed.",

    "title": "Protective effects of Fc-fused PD-L1 on two different animal models of colitis",
    "abstract": "Objective Programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) has been shown to negatively regulate immune responses via its interaction with PD-1 receptor. In this study, we investigated the effects of PD-L1-Fc treatment on intestinal inflammation using two murine models of inflammatory colitis induced by dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) and T-cell transfer. Design The anti-colitis effect of adenovirus expressing Fc-conjugated PD-L1 (Ad/PD-L1-Fc) and recombinant PD-L1-Fc protein was evaluated in DSS-treated wild-type and Rag-1 knockout (KO) mice. We examined differentiation of T-helper cells, frequency of innate immune cells, and cytokine production by dendritic cells (DCs) in the colon from DSS-treated mice after PD-L1-Fc administration. In Rag-1 KO mice reconstituted with CD4 CD45RBhigh T cells, we assessed the treatment effect of PD-L1-Fc protein on the development of colitis. Results Administration of Ad/PD-L1-Fc significantly ameliorated DSS-induced colitis, which was accompanied by diminished frequency of interleukin (IL)-17A-producing CD4 T cells and increased interferon-γ-producing CD4 T cells in the colon of DSS-fed mice. The anti-colitic effect of PD-L1-Fc treatment was also observed in DSS-treated Rag-1 KO mice, indicating lymphoid cell independency. PD-L1-Fc modulated cytokine production by colonic DCs and the effect was dependent on PD-1 expression. Furthermore, PD-L1-Fc protein could significantly reduce the severity of colitis in CD4 CD45RBhigh T-cell-transferred Rag-1 KO mice. Conclusions Based on the protective effect of PD-L1-Fc against DSS-induced and T-cell-induced colitis, our results suggest that PD-1-mediated inhibitory signals have a crucial role in limiting the development of colonic inflammation. This implicates that PD-L1-Fc may provide a novel therapeutic approach to treat inflammatory bowel disease.",

    "abstract": "Cellular and humoral immunity have been implicated in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. To determine whether an intact immune system is necessary for the formation of atherosclerotic lesions, we have generated immunodeficient mice with hypercholesterolemia and atherosclerosis by crossbreeding the apolipoprotein E (apoE)-deficient mouse with the recombinase activating gene 1 (Rag-1) knockout mouse. Chow-fed immunodeficient mice with targeted disruption in both apoE and Rag-1 (E0/R0) had a 2-fold decrement in aortic root lesion size at 16 weeks of age, compared with immunocompetent littermates, which were heterozygotes at the Rag-1 locus (E0/R1). Nearly all atherosclerotic lesions from chow-fed animals were limited to raised foam cell fatty streaks. In contrast, when a second group of animals was fed a high-fat Western-type diet to accelerate lesion development, there were no differences in either aortic root lesion size or the percent of the total aorta occupied by lesions. Fibrous plaques with well-defined caps and necrotic cores were detected in both Western diet-fed E0/R0 and E0/R1 animals. We conclude that T and B lymphocytes play only a minor role in the rate of forming foam cell lesions, and they are not necessary for the formation of fibroproliferative plaques.",

    "title": "Cadmium-based quantum dot induced autophagy formation for cell survival via oxidative stress.",
    "abstract": "Quantum dots (QDs) are one of most utilized nanomaterials in nanocrystalline semiconductors. QDs emit near-infrared fluorescence and can be applied as probes for detecting vasculature and imaging in biological systems. Since QDs have potential in clinical application, the toxicity of QDs needs to be carefully evaluated. In our present study, we elucidate the cytotoxic mechanisms of QDs using a mouse renal adenocarcinoma (RAG) cell line. QDs in RAG cells increased intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels and induced autophagy at 6 h, leading to subsequent apoptosis at 24 h. QDs entered the cells and were located within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), endosome, and lysosome at 6 h and endosome, lysosome, and mitochondria at 24 h. However, QDs only affected mitochondrial function and did not induce ER stress. N-Acetylcysteine, an antioxidant agent, reduced intracellular ROS levels and decreased QD-induced autophagy but enhanced QD-induced cell death. Moreover, 3-methylamphetamine (an autophagy inhibitor) also reduced the cell viability in QD-treated cells. These findings suggest that ROS plays an essential role in the regulation of QD-induced autophagy, which subsequently enhances cell survival. Taken together, these results suggest that oxidative stress-induced autophagy is a defense/survival mechanism against the cytotoxicity of QD.",

The predicted primary structure of the 695‐amino acid‐long protein displays 97% identity to its human homologue shown previously to resemble an integral membrane protein. The protein was detected in rodent brain and muscle by Western blot analysis. Using in situ hybridization and immunocytochemistry on rat brain sections, we discovered that rat amyloidogenic glycoprotein (rAG) and its mRNA are ubiquitously and abundantly expressed in neurons indicating a neuronal original for the amyloid deposits observed in humans with Alzheimer's disease (AD). The protein appears in patches on or near the plasma membranes of neurons suggesting a role for this protein in cell contact. Highest expression was seen in rat brain regions where amyloid is deposited in AD but also in areas which do not contain deposits in AD. Since amyloid deposits are rarely observed in rat brain, we conclude that high expression of AG is not the sole cause of amyloidosis.",

    "title": "In Vivo Blockade of the PD-1 Receptor Suppresses HIV-1 Viral Loads and Improves CD4+ T Cell Levels in Humanized Mice",
    "abstract": "The programmed death-1 (PD-1) pathway limits the function of virus-specific T cells during chronic infection. We previously showed that blockade of the PD-1 pathway increases HIV-1–associated T cell function in vitro. However, the effect of PD-1 blockade on HIV-1 disease progression in vivo has not been examined. As in humans, HIV-1–infected humanized BALB/c-Rag2−/−γc−/− (Rag-hu) mice express elevated levels of PD-1 on T cells during chronic infection. To examine the effect of PD-1 blockade on disease progression, Rag-hu mice with chronic HIV-1 infection were treated with a blocking mAb directed against programmed cell death-1 ligand-1, the ligand for PD-1. Programmed cell death-1 ligand-1–treated Rag-hu mice exhibited a progressive decrease in the HIV-1 plasma viral load, with a 7-fold decrease by day 7, a 20-fold decrease by day 14, a 178-fold decrease by day 21, and a 269-fold decrease by day 28 postinitiation of treatment. By day 7, the percentage of CD4+ T cells was statistically higher in the treated compared with the untreated group, and this trend was sustained throughout the 28-d treatment period. Moreover, there was a strong inverse correlation between plasma viral load and the percentage of both CD4+ (r = −0.66; p < 0.0001) and CD8+ (r = −0.64; p < 0.0001) T cells in the treated mice but not the untreated mice. This study provides “proof of concept” that humanized mice can be used to examine the effects of immunotherapeutic interventions on HIV-1 infection. Furthermore, to our knowledge, these data demonstrate for the first time that blockade of the PD-1 pathway reduces HIV-1 viral loads.",

    "abstract": "Physics simulation offers the possibility of truly responsive and realistic animation. Despite wide adoption of physics simulation for the animation of passive phenomena, such as fluids, cloths and rag‐doll characters, commercial applications still resort to kinematics‐based approaches for the animation of actively controlled characters. However, following a renewed interest in the use of physics simulation for interactive character animation, many recent publications demonstrate tremendous improvements in robustness, visual quality and usability. We present a structured review of over two decades of research on physics‐based character animation, as well as point out various open research areas and possible future directions.",

    "title": "Regulation of B Cell Tolerance by the Lupus Susceptibility Gene Ly108",
    "abstract": "The susceptibility locus for the autoimmune disease lupus on murine chromosome 1, Sle1z/Sle1bz, and the orthologous human locus are associated with production of autoantibody to chromatin. We report that the presence of Sle1z/Sle1bz impairs B cell anergy, receptor revision, and deletion. Members of the SLAM costimulatory molecule family constitute prime candidates for Sle1bz, among which the Ly108.1 isoform of the Ly108 gene was most highly expressed in immature B cells from lupus-prone B6.Sle1z mice. The normal Ly108.2 allele, but not the lupus-associated Ly108.1 allele, was found to sensitize immature B cells to deletion and RAG reexpression. As a potential regulator of tolerance checkpoints, Ly108 may censor self-reactive B cells, hence safeguarding against autoimmunity.",

    "title": "Phospholipase D–dependent mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) activation by glutamine",
    "abstract": "Glutamine is a key nutrient required for sustaining cell proliferation, contributing to nucleotide, protein, and lipid synthesis. The mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) is a highly conserved protein complex that acts as a sensor of nutrients, relaying signals for the shift from catabolic to anabolic metabolism. Although glutamine plays an important role in mTORC1 activation, the mechanism is not clear. Here we describe a leucine- and Rag-independent mechanism of mTORC1 activation by glutamine that depends on phospholipase D and the production of phosphatidic acid, which is required for the stability and activity of mTORC1. The phospholipase D–dependent activation of mTORC1 by glutamine depended on the GTPases ADP ribosylation factor 1 (Arf1), RalA, and Rheb. Glutamine deprivation could be rescued by α-ketoglutarate, a downstream metabolite of glutamine. This mechanism represents a distinct nutrient input to mTORC1 that is independent of Rag GTPases and leucine.",

    "abstract": "We investigated the role of antigen-presenting cells in early interferon (IFN)-γ production in normal and recombinase activating gene 2–deficient (Rag-2−/−) mice in response to Listeria monocytogenes (LM) infection and interleukin (IL)-12 administration. Levels of serum IFN-γ in Rag-2−/− mice were comparable to those of normal mice upon either LM infection or IL-12 injection. Depletion of natural killer (NK) cells by administration of anti-asialoGM1 antibodies had little effect on IFN-γ levels in the sera of Rag-2−/− mice after LM infection or IL-12 injection. Incubation of splenocytes from NK cell–depleted Rag-2−/− mice with LM resulted in the production of IFN-γ that was completely blocked by addition of anti–IL-12 antibodies. Both dendritic cells (DCs) and monocytes purified from splenocytes were capable of producing IFN-γ when cultured in the presence of IL-12. Intracellular immunofluorescence analysis confirmed the IFN-γ production from DCs. It was further shown that IFN-γ was produced predominantly by CD8α+ lymphoid DCs rather than CD8α− myeloid DCs. Collectively, our data indicated that DCs are potent in producing IFN-γ in response to IL-12 produced by bacterial infection and play an important role in innate immunity and subsequent T helper cell type 1 development in vivo.",

    "abstract": "Mutations of the recombinase-activating genes 1 and 2 (RAG1 and RAG2) in humans are associated with a broad range of phenotypes. For patients with severe clinical presentation, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) represents the only curative treatment; however, high rates of graft failure and incomplete immune reconstitution have been observed, especially after unconditioned haploidentical transplantation. Studies in mice have shown that Rag−/− natural killer (NK) cells have a mature phenotype, reduced fitness, and increased cytotoxicity. We aimed to analyze NK cell phenotype and function in patients with mutations in RAG and in non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) genes. Here, we provide evidence that NK cells from these patients have an immature phenotype, with significant expansion of CD56bright CD16−/int CD57− cells, yet increased degranulation and high perforin content. Correlation was observed between in vitro recombinase activity of the mutant proteins, NK cell abnormalities, and in vivo clinical phenotype. Addition of serotherapy in the conditioning regimen, with the aim of depleting the autologous NK cell compartment, may be important to facilitate engraftment and immune reconstitution in patients with RAG and NHEJ defects treated by HSCT.",

    "title": "Biopolymer Extracted from Anadenanthera colubrina (Red Angico Gum) Exerts Therapeutic Potential in Mice: Antidiarrheal Activity and Safety Assessment",
    "abstract": "Anadenanthera colubrina var. cebil (Griseb.) Altschul (Fabaceae family), commonly known as the red angico tree, is a medicinal plant found throughout Brazil’s semi-arid area. In this study, a chemical analysis was performed to investigate the antidiarrheal activity and safety profile of red angico gum (RAG), a biopolymer extracted from the trunk exudate of A. colubrina. Upon FT-IR spectroscopy, RAG showed bands in the regions of 1608 cm−1, 1368 cm−1, and 1029 cm−1, which relate to the vibration of O–H water molecules, deformation vibration of C-O bands, and vibration of the polysaccharide C-O band, respectively, all of which are relevant to glycosidic bonds. The peak molar mass of RAG was 1.89 × 105 g/mol, with the zeta potential indicating electronegativity. RAG demonstrated high yield and solubility with a low degree of impurity. Pre-treatment with RAG reduced the total diarrheal stool and enteropooling. RAG also enhanced Na+/K+-ATPase activity and reduced gastrointestinal transit, and thereby inhibited intestinal smooth muscle contractions. Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) demonstrated that RAG can interact with GM1 receptors and can also reduce E. coli-induced diarrhea in vivo. Moreover, RAG did not induce any signs of toxicity in mice. These results suggest that RAG is a possible candidate for the treatment of diarrheal diseases.",

    "title": "Analysis of the V(D)J Recombination Efficiency at Lymphoid Chromosomal Translocation Breakpoints*",
    "abstract": "Chromosomal translocations and deletions are among the major events that initiate neoplasia. For lymphoid chromosomal translocations, misrecognition by the RAG (recombination activating gene) complex of V(D)J recombination is one contributing factor that has long been proposed. The chromosomal translocations involving LMO2 (t(11;14)(p13;q11)), Ttg-1 (t(11;14)(p15;q11)), and Hox11 (t(10;14)(q24;q11)) are among the clearest examples in which it appears that a D or J segment has synapsed with an adventitious heptamer/nonamer at a gene outside of one of the antigen receptor loci. The interstitial deletion at 1p32 involving SIL (SCL-interrupting locus)/SCL (stem cell leukemia) is a case involving two non-V(D)J sites that have been suggested to be V(D)J recombination mistakes. Here we have used our human extrachromosomal substrate assay to formally test the hypothesis that these regions are V(D)J recombination misrecognition sites and, more importantly, to quantify their efficiency as V(D)J recombination targets within the cell. We find that the LMO2 fragile site functions as a 12-signal at an efficiency that is only 27-fold lower than that of a consensus 12-signal. The Ttg-1 site functions as a 23-signal at an efficiency 530-fold lower than that of a consensus 23-signal. Hox11 failed to undergo recombination as a 12- or 23-signal and was at least 20,000-fold less efficient than consensus signals. SIL has been predicted to function as a 12-signal and SCL as a 23-signal. However, we find that SIL actually functions as a 23-signal. These results provide a formal demonstration that certain chromosomal fragile sites can serve as RAG complex targets, and they determine whether these sites function as 12- versus 23-signals. These results quantify one of the three major factors that determine the frequency of these translocations in T-cell acute lymphocytic leukemia.",

    "title": "Music Cognition and Perceptual Facilitation: A Connectionist Framework",
    "abstract": "The mind internalizes persistent structural regularities in music and recruits these internalized representations to facilitate subsequent perception. Facilitation underlies the generation of musical expectations and implications and the influence of a musical context on consonance and memory. Facilitation is demonstrated in experiments showing priming of chords: chords that are harmonically closely related to a preceding context are processed more quickly than chords that are harmonically distant from the context. A tonal context enhances intonational sensitivity for related chords and heightens their consonance. Facilitation occurs even when related chords don9t share component tones with the context, and even when overlapping harmonics are eliminated. These results point to the indirect activation of representational units at a cognitive level. In a parallel study conducted in India, tones considered to play an important role in a rag but absent from the experimental rendition of that rag were facilitated in the same way. In a connectionist framework, facilitation is a consequence of activation spreading through a network of representational units whose pattern of connectivity encodes musical relationships. In a proposed connectionist model of harmony, each event in a musical sequence activates tone units, and activation spreads via connecting links to parent chord units and then to parent key units. Activation reverberates bidirectionally until the network settles into a state of equilibrium. The initial stages of the activation process constitute the bottom-up influence of the sounded tones, while the later, reverberatory stages constitute the top-down influence of learned, schematic structures internalized at the cognitive level. Computer simulations of the model show the same pattern of data as human subjects in experiments on relatedness judgments of chords and memory for chord sequences.",

    "abstract": "The transcription factors encoded by the E2A and early B cell factor (EBF) genes are required for the proper development of B lymphocytes. However, the absence of B lineage cells in E2A- and EBF-deficient mice has made it difficult to determine the function or relationship between these proteins. We report the identification of a novel model system in which the role of E2A and EBF in the regulation of multiple B lineage traits can be studied. We found that the conversion of 70Z/3 pre-B lymphocytes to cells with a macrophage-like phenotype is associated with the loss of E2A and EBF. Moreover, we show that ectopic expression of the E2A protein E12 in this macrophage line results in the induction of many B lineage genes, including EBF, IL7Rα, λ5, and Rag-1, and the ability to induce κ light chain in response to mitogen. Activation of EBF may be one of the critical functions of E12 in regulating the B lineage phenotype since expression of EBF alone leads to the activation of a subset of E12-inducible traits. Our data demonstrate that, in the context of this macrophage line, E12 induces expression of EBF and together these transcription factors coordinately regulate numerous B lineage–associated genes.",

    "title": "Rheb and Rags come together at the lysosome to activate mTORC1.",
    "abstract": "mTORC1 (mammalian target of rampamycin complex 1) is a highly conserved protein complex regulating cell growth and metabolism via its kinase mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin). The activity of mTOR is under the control of various GTPases, of which Rheb and the Rags play a central role. The presence of amino acids is a strict requirement for mTORC1 activity. The heterodimeric Rag GTPases localize mTORC1 to lysosomes by their amino-acid-dependent interaction with the lysosomal Ragulator complex. Rheb is also thought to reside on lysosomes to activate mTORC1. Rheb is responsive to growth factors, but, in conjunction with PLD1 (phospholipase D1), is also an integral part of the machinery that stimulates mTORC1 in response to amino acids. In the present article, we provide a brief overview of novel mechanisms by which amino acids affect the function of Rags. On the basis of existing literature, we postulate that Rheb is activated at the Golgi from where it will travel to lysosomes. Maturation of endosomes into lysosomes may be required to assure a continuous supply of GTP-bound Rheb for mTORC1 activation, which may help to drive the maturation process.",

Abundant RAG1 and RAG2 protein and messenger RNA was detected in the activated B cells that populate murine splenic and Peyer's patch germinal centers.

    "abstract": "V(D)J recombination is the process by which antibody and T‐cell receptor diversity is attained. During this process, antigen receptor gene segments are cleaved and rejoined by non‐homologous DNA end joining for the generation of combinatorial diversity. The major players of the initial process of cleavage are the proteins known as RAG1 (recombination activating gene 1) and RAG2. In this review, we discuss the physiological function of RAGs as a sequence‐specific nuclease and its pathological role as a structure‐specific nuclease. The first part of the review discusses the basic mechanism of V(D)J recombination, and the last part focuses on how the RAG complex functions as a sequence‐specific and structure‐specific nuclease. It also deals with the off‐target cleavage of RAGs and its implications in genomic instability.",

    "title": "Type I IFNs Regulate Effector and Regulatory T Cell Accumulation and Anti-Inflammatory Cytokine Production during T Cell–Mediated Colitis",
    "abstract": "We explored the function of endogenous type I IFNs (IFN-1) in the colon using the T cell adoptive transfer model of colitis. Colon mononuclear phagocytes (MPs) constitutively produced IFN-1 in a Toll/IL-1R domain–containing adapter-inducing IFN-β–dependent manner. Transfer of CD4+CD45RBhi T cells from wild-type (WT) or IFN-α/β receptor subunit 1 knockout (IFNAR1−/−) mice into RAG−/− hosts resulted in similar onset and severity of colitis. In contrast, RAG−/− × IFNAR1−/− double knockout (DKO) mice developed accelerated severe colitis compared with RAG−/− hosts when transferred with WT CD4+CD45RBhi T cells. IFNAR signaling on host hematopoietic cells was required to delay colitis development. MPs isolated from the colon lamina propria of IFNAR1−/− mice produced less IL-10, IL-1R antagonist, and IL-27 compared with WT MPs. Accelerated colitis development in DKO mice was characterized by early T cell proliferation and accumulation of CD11b+CD103− dendritic cells in the mesenteric lymph nodes, both of which could be reversed by systemic administration of IL-1R antagonist (anakinra). Cotransfer of CD4+CD25+ regulatory T cells (Tregs) from WT or IFNAR1−/− mice prevented disease caused by CD4+CD45RBhi T cells. However, WT CD4+CD25+Foxp3GFP+ Tregs cotransferred with CD4+CD45RBhi T cells into DKO hosts failed to expand or maintain Foxp3 expression and gained effector functions in the colon. To our knowledge, these data are the first to demonstrate an essential role for IFN-1 in the production of anti-inflammatory cytokines by gut MPs and the indirect maintenance of intestinal T cell homeostasis by both limiting effector T cell expansion and promoting Treg stability.",

    "title": "Surgical Diabetic Foot Debridement: Improving Training and Practice Utilizing the Traffic Light Principle",
    "abstract": "Comprehensive management of a severe diabetic foot infection focus on clear treatment pathways. Including rapid, radical debridement of all infection in addition to intravenous antibiotics and supportive measures. However, inexperienced surgeons can often underestimate the extent of infection, risking inadequate debridement, repeated theatre episodes, higher hospital morbidity, and hospital length of stay (LOS). This study aims to assess protocolized diabetic-foot-debridement: Red-Amber-Green (RAG) model as part of a value-based driven intervention. The model highlights necrotic/infected tissue (red-zone, nonviable), followed by areas of moderate damage (amber-zone), healthy tissue (green-zone, viable). Sequential training of orthopedic surgeons supporting our emergency service was undertaken prior to introduction. We compared outcomes before/after RAG introduction (pre-RAG, n = 48; post- RAG, n = 35). Outcomes measured included: impact on number of debridement/individual admission, percentage of individuals requiring multiple debridement, and length-of-hospital-stay as a function-of-cost. All-patients fulfilled grade 2/3, stage-B, of the Texas-Wound-Classification. Those with evidence of ischemia were excluded. The pre-RAG-group were younger (53.8 ± 11.0 years vs 60.3 ± 9.2 years, P = .01); otherwise the 2-groups were matched: HbA1c, white blood cell count, and C-reactive protein. The post-RAG-group underwent significantly lower numbers of debridement’s (1.1 ± 0.3 vs 1.5 ± 0.6/individual admission, P = .003); equired fewer visits to theatre (8.6% vs 38%, P = .003), their LOS was reduced (median LOS pre-RAG 36.0 vs post-RAG 21.5 days, P = .02). RAG facilitates infection clearance, fewer theatre-episodes, and shorter LOS. This protocolized-management-tools in acute severely infected diabetic foot infection offers benefits to patients and health-care-gain.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Due to its higher patency rate, a radial artery graft (RAG) is used as an interposition graft for internal-external high-flow bypass more frequently than a saphenous vein graft (SAG). Nevertheless, there are still a few cases of RAG stenosis after bypass surgery. Unfortunately, these reports do not elaborate on the treatment for RAG stenosis. Here, we report the first case of severe RAG stenosis after high-flow STAt-RA-MCA bypass, which was successfully treated with PTA. We speculated that RAG stenosis is associated with the over-length and kinking of the intracranial segment of the RAG instead of vasospasm. We elaborated on the surgical procedure and treatment experience in this particular case in detail. According to our experience, PTA is a type of surgical procedure that can be considered for treating RAG stenosis after high-flow bypass.

    "abstract": "The lymphohematopoietic progenitors represent < 0.01% of nucleated marrow cells. Here, we describe the immortalization of the murine lymphohematopoietic progenitors by a retroviral vector harboring a dominant-negative retinoic acid receptor. The immortalized progenitors proliferate as a stem-cell-factor-dependent clonal line EML that spontaneously generates pre-pro-B lymphocytes and erythroid and myeloid progenitors. Upon stimulation with interleukin-7 and stromal cells, the pre-pro-B lymphocytes express RAG-1 and undergo D-J rearrangements of the immunoglobulin heavy-chain genes. With erythropoietin the erythroid progenitors proliferate and differentiate into red cells. Generation of the common progenitors for neutrophils and macrophages is suppressed in EML but is inducible by high concentrations of retinoic acid. An additional block in neutrophil differentiation occurs at the promyelocyte stage but can also be overcome by high concentrations of retinoic acid. These studies demonstrate a reproducible way to immortalize lymphohematopoietic progenitors and implicate specific roles for retinoic acid receptors at two distinct stages of hematopoiesis.",

    "title": "mTORC 1 Senses Lysosomal Amino Acids Through an Inside-Out Mechanism That Requires the Vacuolar H +-ATPase",
    "abstract": "The mTOR Complex 1 (mTORC1) protein kinase is a master growth regulator that is stimulated by amino acids. Amino acids activate the Rag guanosine triphosphatases (GTPases), which promote the translocation of mTORC1 to the lysosomal surface, the site of mTORC1 activation. We found that the vacuolar H+-adenosine triphosphatase ATPase (v-ATPase) is necessary for amino acids to activate mTORC1. The v-ATPase engages in extensive amino acid-sensitive interactions with the Ragulator, a scaffolding complex that anchors the Rag GTPases to the lysosome. In a cell-free system, ATP hydrolysis by the v-ATPase, but not the lysosomal pH gradient, was necessary for amino acids to regulate the v-ATPase-Ragulator interaction and promote mTORC1 translocation. Results obtained in vitro and within cells suggests that amino acid signaling initiates within the lysosomal lumen. These results identify the v-ATPase as a component of the mTOR pathway and delineate a lysosome-associated machinery for amino acid sensing. Amino acids are the building blocks of proteins and intermediates in lipid and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) synthesis. They also initiate a signaling cascade in cells that leads to activation of the master growth regulator mTOR Complex 1 (mTORC1). This multicomponent protein kinase integrates inputs from growth factors as well as nutrient and energy supply to control many biosynthetic and catabolic processes (1). Most signals upstream of mTORC1 converge on TSC1-TSC2, a heterodimeric tumor suppressor that negatively regulates the Rheb guanosine triphosphatase (GTPase), which is an essential activator of mTORC1 protein kinase activity (2, 3). In contrast, amino acids signal to mTORC1 by promoting its binding to a distinct family of GTPases, the Rag GTPases (4, 5). *To whom correspondence should be addressed. sabatini@wi.mit.edu.

    "abstract": "Natural helper (NH) cells are recently discovered innate immune cells that confer protective type 2 immunity during helminth infection and mediate influenza-induced airway hypersensitivity. Little is known about the ontogeny of NH cells. We report in this study that NH cells derive from bone marrow lymphoid progenitors. Using RAG-1Cre/ROSA26YFP mice, we show that most NH cells are marked with a history of RAG-1 expression, implying lymphoid developmental origin. The development of NH cells depends on the cytokine receptor Flt3, which is required for the efficient generation of bone marrow lymphoid progenitors. Finally, we demonstrate that lymphoid progenitors, but not myeloid–erythroid progenitors, give rise to NH cells in vivo. This work therefore expands the lymphocyte family, currently comprising T, B, and NK cells, to include NH cells as another type of innate lymphocyte that derives from bone marrow lymphoid progenitors.",

    "abstract": "Expression of the IL-2 receptor alpha chain (CD25) by peripheral CD4 T cells follows cellular activation. However, CD25 expression by CD4 cells is widely used as a marker to identify regulatory T cells (T(R)), although cells with regulatory properties are also found in the CD4+CD25- subset. By using in vivo functional assays and Foxp3 expression as a faithful marker of T(R) differentiation, we have evaluated the requirements for CD25 expression by peripheral T(R). We first show that in vivo depletion of CD25+ cells prevents the development of spontaneous encephalomyelitis in recombination-activating gene (RAG)-deficient anti-myelin basic protein T cell antigen receptor (TCR) transgenic mice, and allows disease induction in otherwise healthy RAG-competent transgenic mice. Similar treatment in normal thymectomized animals is followed by the fast recovery of a normal number of CD25+ T(R). Consistently, Foxp3-expressing T(R) encompassed in the CD25- cell population convert to CD25+ after homeostatic expansion and are selectable by IL-2 in vitro. Surface expression of CD25 on T(R) is controlled by the activity of conventional CD4 cells and is fully labile because it can be lost and regained without affecting the functional potential of the cells. These findings reveal that Foxp3-expressing CD25- cells constitute a peripheral reservoir of differentiated T(R), recruited to the CD25+ pool upon homeostatic expansion and/or activation. This analysis, together with the notion that physiological commitment of T(R) takes place exclusively in the thymus should help for the interpretation of experiments assessing peripheral T(R) differentiation from naive CD4 T cells, defined as CD25-.",

    "title": "Adaptive immune responses mediated by natural killer cells",
    "abstract": "Summary:  Adaptive immunity has traditionally been considered a unique feature of vertebrate physiology. Unlike innate immune responses, which remain essentially unchanged upon exposure to a recurrent challenge with the same stimulus, adaptive immune cells possess the ability to learn and remember. Thus, secondary adaptive responses to a previously encountered challenge are qualitatively and/or quantitatively distinct from those elicited by a primary encounter. Besides this capacity to acquire long‐lived memory, the second cardinal feature of adaptive immunity is antigen specificity. It has been generally believed that only T and B cells can develop antigen‐specific immunologic memory, because these lymphocytes uniquely express recombination‐activating gene (RAG) proteins, which are necessary for somatic rearrangement of V(D)J gene segments to assemble diverse antigen‐specific receptors. However, recent work has uncovered discrete subsets of murine natural killer (NK) cells capable of mediating long‐lived, antigen‐specific recall responses to a variety of hapten‐based contact sensitizers. These NK cells appear to use distinct, RAG‐independent mechanisms to generate antigen specificity. Murine NK cells have also recently been shown to develop memory upon viral infection. Here, we review recent evidence indicating that at least some NK cells are capable of mediating what appears to be adaptive immunity and discuss potential mechanisms that may contribute to RAG‐independent generation of antigenic diversity and longevity.",

    "abstract": "T cell early precursors belong to the CD3-CD4-CD8- triple negative (TN) thymocyte population that can be subdivided on the basis of CD44, CD25, and heat-stable Ag (HSA) expression. The kinetics and precursor product relationships of these subsets, as well as of the CD4/8low intermediates, were studied by using pulse labeling with bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd). The highest frequencies of DNA-synthesizing cells were found in CD44+CD25+ and CD44-CD25low or CD25- subsets. The major TN cell type (CD44-CD25high), as well as CD44+ CD25-HSAlow early precursors, contained a majority of resting cells. RAG-2-/- mice contained less cells in DNA synthesis than normal mice, and CD44-CD25-/low cells were absent. In female mice transgenic for the anti-HYTCR, CD44-CD25high cells were almost all cycling, but a high percentage of resting cells was found in CD44-CD25- cells. In days following the BrdUrd pulse, there was a reduction in the number of BrdUrd+ cells in most subsets, with the exception of the labeled CD44-CD25high cells that showed a bell-shaped curve. The kinetics and cell size evolution suggest that the majority of these cells do not give rise to CD4+CD8+ cells. In RAG-2-/- cells, the block at the CD44-CD25high stage involved all cells. In TCR transgenic (Tg) mice, no block was seen at the CD44-CD25high stage, suggesting that early expression of a complete TCR receptor precludes the normal selection step. However, another block in the differentiation process was observed at the CD44-CD25- step in TCR Tg mice, suggesting an additional selection point.",

    "abstract": "Interaction between dendritic cells (DCs) and T cells is a prerequisite for the initiation of a T cell response. The molecular nature of this interaction remains to be fully characterized. We report in this work that freshly isolated mouse splenic DCs and bone marrow-derived DCs express CD137 on the cell surface and in soluble form. Triggering CD137 increased the secretion of IL-6 and IL-12 from DCs. More importantly, infusion of an agonistic mAb to CD137 into naive mice enhanced the ability of DCs to stimulate T cell proliferation in response to both alloantigens and a nominal Ag in vitro. This enhancement of DC function is not mediated through activation of T cells, because the effect was also observed in RAG-1 knockout mice that lack T cells. Our findings implicate CD137 as an important receptor involved in the modulation of DC function.",

    "title": "Large-Scale Aerial Image Categorization Using a Multitask Topological Codebook",
    "abstract": "Fast and accurately categorizing the millions of aerial images on Google Maps is a useful technique in pattern recognition. Existing methods cannot handle this task successfully due to two reasons: 1) the aerial images' topologies are the key feature to distinguish their categories, but they cannot be effectively encoded by a conventional visual codebook and 2) it is challenging to build a realtime image categorization system, as some geo-aware Apps update over 20 aerial images per second. To solve these problems, we propose an efficient aerial image categorization algorithm. It focuses on learning a discriminative topological codebook of aerial images under a multitask learning framework. The pipeline can be summarized as follows. We first construct a region adjacency graph (RAG) that describes the topology of each aerial image. Naturally, aerial image categorization can be formulated as RAG-to-RAG matching. According to graph theory, RAG-to-RAG matching is conducted by enumeratively comparing all their respective graphlets (i.e., small subgraphs). To alleviate the high time consumption, we propose to learn a codebook containing topologies jointly discriminative to multiple categories. The learned topological codebook guides the extraction of the discriminative graphlets. Finally, these graphlets are integrated into an AdaBoost model for predicting aerial image categories. Experimental results show that our approach is competitive to several existing recognition models. Furthermore, over 24 aerial images are processed per second, demonstrating that our approach is ready for real-world applications.",

    "title": "Two waves of recombinase gene expression in developing thymocytes",
    "abstract": "During T cell development in the thymus, T cell receptor (TCR) alpha, beta, gamma, and delta genes are rearranged and expressed. TCR rearrangement strictly depends upon the coordinate activity of two recombinase activating genes, Rag-1 and Rag-2. In this study we have followed the expression of these genes at different stages of intrathymic development. The results indicate that there are two periods of high Rag-1 and Rag-2 mRNA expression. The first wave peaks early at the CD25+CD4-CD8-CD3- stage of development and coincides with the initial appearance of transcripts derived from fully rearranged TCR beta, gamma, and delta genes, whereas the second wave occurs later at the CD4+CD8+ stage coincident with full-length TCR alpha mRNA expression. Active downregulation of Rag-1 and Rag-2 mRNA expression appears to occur in vivo between the two peaks of recombinase activity. This phenomenon can be mimicked in vitro in response to artificial stimuli such as phorbol myristate acetate and calcium ionophore. Collectively our data suggest that recombinase expression is actively regulated during early thymus development independently of cell surface expression of a mature heterodimeric TCR protein complex.",

    "abstract": "The analysis of the expression of the alpha chain of the IL-2 receptor (CD25, TAC) on the surface of B lineage cells in mouse bone marrow reveals that it is a useful marker to distinguish pre-B-I from pre-B-II cells. CD25 is not expressed on CD45R(B220)+ c-kit+ CD43+ TdT+ lambda 5+ c mu- sIg-IgH chain locus DJH-rearranged pre-B-I cells of mouse bone marrow. It is expressed on large cycling CD45R(B220)+ c-kit- CD43+ TdT- lambda 5+ c mu+ sIg- and on small resting CD45R(B220)+ c-kit- CD43- TdT- lambda 5- c mu- sIg- IgH chain locus VHDJH-rearranged pre-B-II cells. Therefore, the transition from pre-B-I to large pre-B-II cells is marked by the downregulation of c-kit and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT), and by the upregulation of CD25. SCID, RAG-2T, microMT and lambda 5T mutant mice do have normal, if not elevated numbers of pre-B-I cells but lack all CD25+ pre-B-II cells in their bone marrow. The expression of a transgenic H chain under control of the microH chain enhancer in RAG-2T bone marrow B lineage precursors allows the development of large and small CD25+ pre-B-II cells. The results suggest that the differentiation of pre-B-I to pre-B-II cells in mouse bone marrow requires the expression of microH chains and surrogate L chains in membranes, probably on the surface of precursor B cells.",

    "abstract": "TCR-beta gene rearrangement or expression is necessary and sufficient for the progression of early alpha beta thymocyte differentiation from the CD3-CD4-CD8- triple negative (TN)3 to the CD4+CD8+ double positive stage. The onset of TCR-beta rearrangement is currently thought to occur gradually. Some thymocytes were reported to be rearranged at the earliest (CD44+CD25-) TN stage, whereas other thymocytes did not initiate TCR-beta rearrangement until the latest (CD44-CD25-) TN stage. Here, we have isolated subsets of TN thymocytes on the basis of surface expression of CD44 and CD25, with c-kit as an additional marker. We present a revised model of early T cell development in which TCR-beta and TCR-gamma rearrangements occur abruptly, at the CD44lowCD25+ c-kitlowTN stage. A high level of c-kit expression defines pro-T cells which have not yet rearranged their TCR genes. Germ-line TCR-beta transcripts, and transcripts of recombination activating genes (RAG)-1 and 2, are detected before TCR-beta gene rearrangement. Analyses of TN thymocytes of RAG-1 mutant mice, and of various TCR mutant and TCR transgenic RAG-1 mutant mice, indicate the existence of a control point at the CD44-CD25+TN stage at which cells expressing a productively rearranged TCR-beta chain are selected for further differentiation.",

    "abstract": "Immunological diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are infrequent in less developed countries, possibly because helminths provide protection by modulating host immunity. In IBD murine models, the helminth Heligmosomoides polygyrus bakeri prevents colitis. It was determined whether H. polygyrus bakeri mediated IBD protection by altering dendritic cell (DC) function. We used a Rag IBD model where animals were reconstituted with IL10−/− T cells, making them susceptible to IBD and with OVA Ag-responsive OT2 T cells, allowing study of a gut antigenic response. Intestinal DC from H. polygyrus bakeri-infected Rag mice added to lamina propria mononuclear cells (LPMC) isolated from colitic animals blocked OVA IFN-γ/IL-17 responses in vitro through direct contact with the inflammatory LPMC. DC from uninfected Rag mice displayed no regulatory activity. Transfer of DC from H. polygyrus bakeri-infected mice into Rag mice reconstituted with IL10−/− T cells protected animals from IBD, and LPMC from these mice lost OVA responsiveness. After DC transfer, OT2 T cells populated the intestines normally. However, the OT2 T cells were rendered Ag nonresponsive through regulatory action of LPMC non-T cells. The process of regulation appeared to be regulatory T cell independent. Thus, H. polygyrus bakeri modulates intestinal DC function, rendering them tolerogenic. This appears to be an important mechanism through which H. polygyrus bakeri suppresses colitis. IFN-γ and IL-17 are colitogenic. The capacity of these DC to block a gut Ag-specific IFN-γ/IL-17 T cell response also is significant.",

Macrophages showed marked renin up-regulation in the absence of VDR, and inhibition of renin by aliskiren reduced atherosclerosis in LDLR(-/-)/VDR(-/-) mice, suggesting that the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) promotes atherosclerosis in the absence of VDR. LDLR(-/-) mice receiving LDLR(-/-)/VDR(-/-) BMT developed larger lesions than LDLR(-/-) BMT controls. Moreover, LDLR(-/-) mice receiving Rag-1(-/-)/VDR(-/-) BMT, which were unable to generate functional T and B lymphocytes, still had more severe atherosclerosis than Rag-1(-/-) BMT controls, suggesting a critical role of macrophage VDR signaling in atherosclerotic suppression. Aliskiren treatment eliminated the difference in lesions between Rag-1(-/-)/VDR(-/-) BMT and Rag-1(-/-) BMT recipients, indicating that local RAS activation in macrophages contributes to the enhanced atherogenesis seen in Rag-1(-/-)/VDR(-/-) BMT mice. Taken together, these observations provide evidence that macrophage VDR signaling, in part by suppressing the local RAS, inhibits atherosclerosis in mice.",

A set of edit operations to transform one RAG into another one are defined as regions are represented by polylines and string matching techniques are used to measure their similarity.

    "abstract": "Murine autoimmune gastritis, induced by neonatal thymectomy or the injection of CD25-depleted lymphocytes into nu/nu recipients, is characterized by an inflammatory infiltrate into the gastric mucosa, parietal cell destruction and circulating anti-parietal cell antibodies. Using RAG-2(-/-)mice as recipients, we determined that the induction of disease relies on CD4(+)CD25(-)effector cells and prevention relies on CD4(+)CD25(+)regulatory cells; neither requires participation of CD8 cells or B cells. The severity of gastritis was dependent on the cytokine repertoire of CD4(+)CD25(-)effector T cells. Recipients of IL-4(-/-)T cells developed more severe gastritis and recipients of INF-gamma(-/-)T cells developed milder disease than recipients of wildtype or IL-10(-/-)effector T cells. Gastritis did not develop in the absence of IL-12. Protection from gastritis does not require either IL-4 or IL-10 because CD4(+)CD25(+)cells from IL-4(-/-)or IL-10(-/-)mice completely abrogated the disease process. CD4(+)CD25(+)cells also protected RAG-2(-/-)recipients from colitis and inhibitory activity was partially dependent on IL-10 expression. These findings highlight the critical role of CD4(+)CD25(+)regulatory T cells in protection from several autoimmune syndromes and delineate the differential contribution of IL-10 to CD4(+)CD25(+)Treg activity in the settings of gastritis and colitis.",

    "abstract": "Numerous studies have highlighted the importance of high-affinity interactions between T cell receptors (TCRs) and their ligands in the selection of Foxp3+ regulatory T cells (T reg cells). To determine the role of the TCR in directing T cells into the Foxp3+ lineage, we generated transgenic (Tg) mice expressing TCRs from Foxp3+ cells. Initial analyses of the TCR Tg mice crossed with RAG-deficient mice showed that the percentage of Foxp3+ cells was very low. However, intrathymic injection and bone marrow chimera experiments showed a saturable increase of the Foxp3+ population when T reg TCR Tg cells were present in low numbers. Furthermore, when analyzing whole thymi of T reg TCR Tg RAG-deficient mice, we found significantly more Foxp3+ cells than in conventional T cell TCR Tg mice. Our results indicate that although the TCR has an instructive role in determining Foxp3 expression, selection of Foxp3+ individual clones in the thymus is limited by a very small niche.",

    "title": "Measurement of resilience potential - development of a resilience assessment grid for emergency departments",
    "abstract": "Background Resilience engineering has been advocated as an alternative to the management of safety over the last decade in many domains. However, to facilitate metrics for measuring and helping analyze the resilience potential for emergency departments (EDs) remains a significant challenge. The study aims to redesign the Hollnagel’s resilience assessment grid (RAG) into a custom-made RAG (ED-RAG) to support resilience management in EDs. Methods The study approach had three parts: 1) translation of Hollnagel’s RAG into Chinese version, followed by generation of a tailored set of ED-RAG questions adapted to EDs; 2) testing and revising the tailored sets until to achieve satisfactory validity for application; 3) design of a new rating scale and scoring method. The test criteria of the ED-RAG questionnaire adopted the modified three-level scoring criteria proposed by Bloom and Fischer. The study setting of the field test is a private regional hospital. Results The fifth version of ED-RAG was acceptable after a field test. It has three sets of open structured questions for the potentials to respond, monitor, and anticipate, and a set of structured questions for the potential to learn. It contained 38 questions corresponding to 32 foci. A new 4-level rating scale along with a novel scaling method can improve the scores conversion validity and communication between team members and across investigations. This final version is set to complete an interview for around 2 hours. Conclusions The ED-RAG represents a snapshot of EDs’resilience under specific conditions. It might be performed multiple times by a single hospital to monitor the directions and contents of improvement that can supplement conventional safety management toward resilience. Some considerations are required to be successful when hospitals use it. Future studies to overcome the potential methodological weaknesses of the ED-RAG are needed.",

We have used RAG-2 deficient blastocyst complementation to create mice specifically lacking B cell complement receptors. Despite normal expression of complement receptor 1 (CR1[CD35]) and CR2 (CD21) on follicular dendritic cells, these mice have a profound defect in their capacity to mount a T-dependent antibody response. This is the first direct demonstration in vivo that B cell expression of complement receptors is required for a humoral immune response. This is the first direct demonstration in vivo that B cell expression of complement receptors is required for a humoral immune response. This suggests that CD21 and/or CD35 on B lymphocytes may be required for cellular activation, adsorptive endocytosis of antigen, recruitment to germinal centers, and/or protection from apoptosis during the humoral response to T-dependent antigens.",

    "title": "NK Cell-Derived IFN-γ Differentially Regulates Innate Resistance and Neutrophil Response in T Cell-Deficient Hosts Infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis",
    "abstract": "Although it is known that IFN-γ-secreting T cells are critical for control of Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection, the contribution of IFN-γ produced by NK cells to host resistance to the pathogen is less well understood. By using T cell-deficient RAG−/− mice, we showed that M. tuberculosis stimulates NK cell-dependent IFN-γ production in naive splenic cultures and in lungs of infected animals. More importantly, common cytokine receptor γ-chain−/−RAG−/− animals deficient in NK cells, p40−/−RAG−/−, or anti-IFN-γ mAb-treated RAG−/− mice displayed significantly increased susceptibility to M. tuberculosis infection compared with untreated NK-sufficient RAG−/− controls. Studies comparing IL-12 p40- and p35-deficient RAG−/− mice indicated that IL-12 plays a more critical role in the induction of IFN-γ-mediated antimycobacterial effector functions than IL-23 or other p40-containing IL-12 family members. The increased susceptibility of IL-12-deficient or anti-IFN-γ mAb-treated RAG−/− mice was associated not only with elevated bacterial loads, but also with the development of granulocyte-enriched foci in lungs. This tissue response correlated with increased expression of the granulocyte chemotactic chemokines KC and MIP-2 in NK as well as other leukocyte populations. Interestingly, depletion of granulocytes further increased bacterial burdens and exacerbated pulmonary pathology in these animals, revealing a compensatory function for neutrophils in the absence of IFN-γ. The above observations indicate that NK cell-derived IFN-γ differentially regulates T-independent resistance and granulocyte function in M. tuberculosis infection and suggest that this response could serve as an important barrier in AIDS patients or other individuals with compromised CD4+ T cell function.",

    "title": "The c-Myc/miR17-92/PTEN Axis Tunes PI3K Activity to Control Expression of Recombination Activating Genes in Early B Cell Development",
    "abstract": "Appropriate PI3K signals generated by the antigen receptor are essential to promote B cell development. Regulation of recombination activating gene (RAG)-1 and RAG-2 expression is one key process that is mediated by PI3K to ensure developmental progression and selection. When PI3K signals are too high or too low, expression of RAGs does not turn off and B cell development is impaired or blocked. Yet, the mechanism which tunes PI3K activity to control RAG expression during B cell development in the bone marrow is unknown. Recently we showed that a c-Myc/miR17-92/PTEN axis regulates PI3K activity for positive and negative selection of immature B cells. Here, we show that the c-Myc/miR17-92/PTEN axis tunes PI3K activity to control the expression of RAGs in proB cells. Using different genetically engineered mouse models we show that impaired function of the c-Myc/miR17-92/PTEN axis alters the PI3K/Akt/Foxo1 pathway to result in dis-regulated expression of RAG and a block in B cell development. Studies using 38c-13 B lymphoma cells, where RAGs are constitutively expressed, suggest that this regulatory effect is mediated post-translationally through Foxo1.",

    "title": "A systematic review and meta-analysis of robot-assisted versus laparoscopically assisted gastrectomy for gastric cancer",
    "abstract": "Background: Robotic-assisted gastrectomy (RAG) has been used for gastric cancer since 2002. This meta-analysis was carried out to evaluate whether RAG is safer and more effective than conventional laparoscopically assisted gastrectomy (LAG) for gastric cancer. Methods: We performed a manual search for these 2 types of operations (RAG and LAG) in the PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library databases up to April 30, 2016. Twelve nonrandomized controlled trials that reported on RAG and LAG for gastric cancer were included. Outcomes evaluated included operation time, number of retrieved lymph nodes, blood loss, length of the resection margin, complications, and postoperative hospital stay. Results: A total of 3744 patients in 12 studies were included (1134 patients in the RAG group and 2610 patients in the LAG group). The operation time was significantly shorter in the LAG group [weighted mean difference (WMD) 42.0 (95% confidence interval, 95% CI 28.11–55.89) minutes; P < .00001], while the loss of blood volume was lower in the RAG group (P = .01). The number of retrieved lymph nodes, duration of postoperative stay, length of the proximal resection margin, length of the distal resection margin, and postoperative complications were similar between groups. Conclusion: We conclude that RAG is a safe and appropriate treatment for gastric cancer patients in comparison to LAG. Nevertheless, RAG is not superior to LAG. Future research on RAG should focus on comparing the differences in retrieved lymph nodes in different tiers, evaluating the postoperative recovery and reducing the cost of the treatment.",

    "abstract": "We report eight cases of epithelioid angiosarcoma arising in deep, usually intramuscular soft tissue. All the patients were men (mean age, 58). All the lesions arose in a limb or limb girdle. Cardinal morphologic features were the diffuse, sheetlike growth pattern, with only focally apparent vascular differentiation, and epithelioid tumor cells with a degree of intracytoplasmic vacuolation/lumen formation. Immunohistochemically, all eight cases coex-pressed keratin as well as endothelial markers. In three cases, endothelial differentiation was confirmed ultra-structurally. Clinically, deep-seated epithelioid angiosarcomas are high-grade neoplasms that rapidly develop metastases. These findings expand the range of recognized epithelioid endothelial tumors and provide further evidence of keratin expression by such lesions. The presence of intracytoplasmic lumina/vacuoles (sometimes containing red blood cells) combined with the characteristic reticulin pattern and striking positivity for Factor VIII-RAg provide the clearest means of distinction from an epithelial metastasis.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT Protective immunity against tuberculosis (TB) requires the integrated response of a network of lymphocytes. Both gamma interferon (IFN-γ)- and interleukin 17 (IL-17)-secreting CD4+ T cells have been identified in subjects with latent TB infection and during experimental Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection, but the contribution of Th17 cells to protective immunity is unclear. To examine their protective effects in vivo, we transferred mycobacterium-specific IL-17- and IFN-γ-secreting CD4+ T cells isolated from M. tuberculosis BCG-immunized IL-12p40−/− and IFN-γ−/− or wild-type mice, respectively, into M. tuberculosis-infected IL-12p40−/− or RAG−/− mice. In the absence of IL-12 and IL-23, neither IL-17-secreting (Th17) nor IFN-γ-secreting (Th1) BCG-specific T cells expanded or provided protection against M. tuberculosis. In RAG−/− recipients with an intact IL-12/IL-23 axis, both Th17 and Th1 cells were activated and induced significant protection against M. tuberculosis. The reduction in the bacterial load following transfer of IFN-γ−/− Th17 cells was associated with significant prolongation of survival compared to recipients of naïve IFN-γ−/− T cells. This effect was at the cost of an increased inflammatory infiltrate characterized by an excess of neutrophils. Therefore, Th17 cells can provide IFN-γ-independent protection against M. tuberculosis, and this effect may contribute to the early control of M. tuberculosis infection.",

    "abstract": "CD69 is highly expressed by lymphocytes at mucosal surfaces. We aimed to investigate the role of CD69 in mucosal immune responses. The expression of CD69 by CD4 T cells isolated from the spleen, mesenteric lymph nodes, small intestinal lamina propria, and colonic lamina propria was determined in specific pathogen-free B6 and TCR transgenic animals, as well as in germ-free B6 mice. Transfer colitis was induced by transplanting RAG−/− mice with B6 or CD69−/−CD45RBhigh CD4 T cells. CD69 expression by CD4 T cells is induced by the intestinal microflora, oral delivery of specific Ag, and type I IFN (IFN-I) signals. CD4 T cells from CD69−/− animals produce higher amounts of the proinflammatory cytokines IFN-γ, TNF-α, and IL-21, whereas the production of TGF-β1 is decreased. CD69-deficient CD4 T cells showed reduced potential to differentiate into Foxp3+ regulatory T cells in vivo and in vitro. The transfer of CD69−/−CD45RBhigh CD4 T cells into RAG−/− hosts induced an accelerated colitis. Oral tolerance was impaired in CD69−/− and IFN-I receptor 1-deficient mice when compared with B6 and OT-II × RAG−/− animals. Polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid treatment of RAG−/− mice transplanted with B6 but not CD69−/− or IFN-I receptor 1-deficient CD45RBhigh CD4 T cells attenuated transfer colitis. CD69 deficiency led to the increased production of proinflammatory cytokines, reduced Foxp3+ regulatory T cell induction, impaired oral tolerance, and more severe colitis. Hence, the activation Ag CD69 plays an important role in regulating mucosal immune responses.",

IL-15−/− and RAG-2−/−/γc−/− mice were 100-fold more susceptible and RAG-2−/−, CD-1−/− (NKT−), and gamma interferon (IFN-γ)−/− mice were 10-fold more susceptible to vaginal HSV-2 infection than control C57BL/6 mice. NK and/or NKT cells were the early source of IFN-γ in vaginal secretions following genital HSV-2 infection. This study demonstrates that IL-15 and NK-NKT cells are critical for innate protection against genital HSV-2.",

    "title": "An Induced Susceptibility Response in Soybean Promotes Avirulent Aphis glycines (Hemiptera: Aphididae) Populations on Resistant Soybean",
    "abstract": "ABSTRACT \n Observations of virulent Aphis glycines Matsumura populations on resistant soybean in North America occurred prior to the commercial release of Rag genes. Laboratory assays confirmed the presence of four A. glycines biotypes in North America defined by their virulence to the Rag1 and Rag2 genes. Avirulent and virulent biotypes can co-occur and potentially interact on soybean, which may result in induced susceptibility. We conducted a series of experiments to determine if the survival of avirulent biotypes on susceptible and resistant soybean containing the Rag1 or Rag1 + Rag2 genes was affected by the presence of either avirulent or virulent conspecifics. Regardless of virulence to Rag genes, initial feeding by conspecifics increased the survival of subsequent A. glycines populations on both susceptible and resistant soybean. Avirulent populations increased at the same rate as virulent populations if the resistant plants were initially colonized with virulent aphids. These results are the first to demonstrate that virulent A. glycines increase the suitability of resistant soybean for avirulent conspecifics, thus explaining the lack of genetic differentiation observed in North America between A. glycines populations on resistant and susceptible soybean. These results suggest the occurrence of virulence toward Rag genes in North America may be overestimated. In addition this may alter the selection pressure for virulence genes to increase in a population. Therefore, insect resistance management models for A. glycines may need to incorporate induced susceptibility factors to determine the relative durability of resistance genes.",

    "abstract": "The target of rapamycin (TOR) complex 1 (TORC1) is a central cell growth regulator in response to a wide array of signals. The Rag GTPases play an essential role in relaying amino acid signals to TORC1 activation through direct interaction with raptor and recruitment of the TORC1 complex to lysosomes. Here we present the crystal structure of the Gtr1p-Gtr2p complex, the Rag homologs from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, at 2.8 Å resolution. The heterodimeric GTPases reveal a pseudo-twofold symmetric organization. Structure-guided functional analyses of RagA-RagC, the human homologs of Gtr1p-Gtr2p, show that both G domains (N-terminal GTPase domains) and dimerization are important for raptor binding. In particular, the switch regions of the G domain in RagA are indispensible for interaction with raptor, and hence TORC1 activation. The dimerized C-terminal domains of RagA-RagC display a remarkable structural similarity to MP1/p14, which is in a complex with lysosome membrane protein p18, and directly interact with p18, therefore recruiting mTORC1 to the lysosome for activation by Rheb. Our results reveal a structural model for the mechanism of the Rag GTPases in TORC1 activation and amino acid signaling.",

    "title": "A pipeline for computational design of novel RNA-like topologies",
    "abstract": "Abstract Designing novel RNA topologies is a challenge, with important therapeutic and industrial applications. We describe a computational pipeline for design of novel RNA topologies based on our coarse-grained RNA-As-Graphs (RAG) framework. RAG represents RNA structures as tree graphs and describes RNA secondary (2D) structure topologies (currently up to 13 vertices, ≈260 nucleotides). We have previously identified novel graph topologies that are RNA-like among these. Here we describe a systematic design pipeline and illustrate design for six broad design problems using recently developed tools for graph-partitioning and fragment assembly (F-RAG). Following partitioning of the target graph, corresponding atomic fragments from our RAG-3D database are combined using F-RAG, and the candidate atomic models are scored using a knowledge-based potential developed for 3D structure prediction. The sequences of the top scoring models are screened further using available tools for 2D structure prediction. The results indicate that our modular approach based on RNA-like topologies rather than specific 2D structures allows for greater flexibility in the design process, and generates a large number of candidate sequences quickly. Experimental structure probing using SHAPE-MaP for two sequences agree with our predictions and suggest that our combined tools yield excellent candidates for further sequence and experimental screening.",

    "title": "Characterization of Ross River Virus Tropism and Virus-Induced Inflammation in a Mouse Model of Viral Arthritis and Myositis",
    "abstract": "ABSTRACT Mosquito-borne alphaviruses are a significant cause of both encephalitic and arthritic disease in humans worldwide. In contrast to the encephalitic alphaviruses, the pathogenesis of alphavirus-induced arthritic disease is not well understood. Utilizing a mouse model of Ross River virus (RRV) disease, we found that the primary targets of RRV infection are bone, joint, and skeletal muscle tissues of the hind limbs in both outbred CD-1 mice and adult C57BL/6J mice. Moreover, histological analyses demonstrated that RRV infection resulted in severe inflammation of these tissues. Characterization of the inflammatory infiltrate within the skeletal muscle tissue identified inflammatory macrophages, NK cells, and CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes. To determine the contribution of the adaptive immune system, the outcome of RRV-induced disease was examined in C57BL/6J RAG-1−/− mice, which lack functional T and B lymphocytes. RAG-1−/− and wild-type mice developed similar disease signs, infiltration of inflammatory macrophages and NK cells, and muscle pathology, suggesting that the adaptive immune response does not play a critical role in the development of disease. These results establish the mouse model of RRV disease as a useful system for the identification of viral and host factors that contribute to alphavirus-induced arthritis and myositis.",

    "abstract": "For vision, insect and vertebrate eyes use rhabdomeric and ciliary photoreceptor cells, respectively. These cells show distinct architecture and transduce the light signal by different phototransductory cascades. In the marine rag-worm Platynereis, we find both cell types: rhabdomeric photoreceptor cells in the eyes and ciliary photoreceptor cells in the brain. The latter use a photopigment closely related to vertebrate rod and cone opsins. Comparative analysis indicates that both types of photoreceptors, with distinct opsins, coexisted in Urbilateria, the last common ancestor of insects and vertebrates, and sheds new light on vertebrate eye evolution.",

    "abstract": "V(D)J recombination requires a pair of signal sequences with spacer lengths of 12 and 23 bp between the conserved heptamer and nonamer elements. The RAG1 and RAG2 proteins initiate the reaction by making double‐strand DNA breaks at both signals, and must thus be able to operate on these two different spatial arrangements. We show that the DNA‐bending proteins HMG1 and HMG2 stimulate cleavage and RAG protein binding at the 23 bp spacer signal. These findings suggest that DNA bending is important for bridging the longer spacer, and explain how a similar array of RAG proteins could accommodate a signal with either a 12 or a 23 bp spacer. An additional effect of HMG proteins is to stimulate coupled cleavage greatly when both signal sequences are present, suggesting that these proteins also aid the formation of a synaptic complex.",

The output is a sequence of triangle meshes with static connectivity and with detail at the scale of individual markers in both smooth and folded regions. We compute markers' coordinates in space using correspondence across multiple synchronized video cameras. Correspondence is determined from color information in small neighborhoods and refined using a novel strain pruning process. Final correspondence does not require neighborhood information. We use a novel data driven hole-filling technique to fill occluded regions. Our results include several challenging examples: a wrinkled shirt sleeve, a dancing pair of pants, and a rag tossed onto a cup. Finally, we demonstrate that cloth capture is reusable by animating a pair of pants using human motion capture data.",

    "title": "Immunohistochemistry in the evaluation of neovascularization in tumor xenografts",
    "abstract": "Angiogenesis, or neovascularization, is known to play an important role in the neoplastic progression leading to metastasis. CD31 or Factor VIII-related antigen (F VIII RAg) immunohistochemistry is widely used in experimental studies for quantifying tumor neovascularization in immunocompromised animal models implanted with transformed human cell lines. Quantification, however, can be affected by variations in the methodology used to measure vascularization including antibody selection, antigen retrieval (AR) pretreatment, and evaluation techniques. To examine this further, we investigated the microvessel density (MVD) and the intensity of microvascular staining among five different human tumor xenografts and a mouse syngeneic tumor using anti-CD31 and F VIII RAg immunohistochemical staining. Different AR methods also were evaluated. Maximal retrieval of CD31 was achieved using 0.5 M Tris (pH 10) buffer, while maximum retrieval of F VIII RAg was achieved using 0.05% pepsin treatment of tissue sections. For each optimized retrieval condition, anti-CD31 highlighted small vessels better than F VIII RAg. Furthermore, the MVD of CD31 was significantly greater than that of F VIII RAg decorated vessels (p<0.001). The choice of antibody and AR method has a significant affect on immunohistochemical findings when studying angiogenesis. One also must use caution when comparing studies in the literature that use different techniques and reagents.",

    "abstract": "Agonists of the sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor (S1PR) attenuate kidney ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI). Previous studies suggested that S1P1R-induced lymphopenia mediates this protective effect, but lymphocyte-independent mechanisms could also contribute. Here, we investigated the effects of S1PR agonists on kidney IRI in mice that lack T and B lymphocytes (Rag-1 knockout mice). Administration of the nonselective S1PR agonist FTY720 or the selective S1P1R agonist SEW2871 reduced injury in both Rag-1 knockout and wild-type mice. In vitro, SEW2871 significantly attenuated LPS- or hypoxia/reoxygenation-induced apoptosis in cultured mouse proximal tubule epithelial cells, supporting a direct protective effect of S1P1R agonists via mitogen-activated protein kinase and/or Akt pathways. S1P1Rs in the proximal tubule mediated IRI in vivo as well: Mice deficient in proximal tubule S1P1Rs experienced a greater decline in renal function after IRI than control mice and their kidneys were no longer protected by SEW2871 administration. In summary, S1PRs in the proximal tubule are necessary for stress-induced cell survival, and S1P1R agonists are renoprotective via direct effects on the tubule cells. Selective agonists of S1P1Rs may hold therapeutic potential for the prevention and treatment of acute kidney injury.",

    "abstract": "Colorectal cancer in humans results from sequential genetic changes in intestinal epithelia commencing with inactivation of the APC tumor suppressor gene. Roles for host immunity in epithelial tumorigenesis are poorly understood. It has been previously shown that CD4+CD25+ lymphocytes inhibit colitis-associated epithelial tumors in Rag-deficient mice. Here we show that addition of CD4+CD25+ lymphocytes in ApcMin/+ mice reduces multiplicity of epithelial adenomas. Interleukin-10 was required in regulatory cells for therapeutic effect. Recipients of regulatory cells showed increased apoptosis and down-regulation of cyclooxygenase-2 within tumors coincident with tumor regression. These data suggest a role for regulatory lymphocytes in epithelial homeostasis in the ApcMin/+ mouse model of intestinal polyposis. Similarities with cancer of the breast, prostate, lung, and other sites raise the possibility of broader roles for regulatory lymphocytes in prevention and treatment of epithelial cancers in humans.",

    "title": "Evidence for Replicative Repair of DNA Double-Strand Breaks Leading to Oncogenic Translocation and Gene Amplification",
    "abstract": "Nonreciprocal translocations and gene amplifications are commonly found in human tumors. Although little is known about the mechanisms leading to such aberrations, tissue culture models predict that they can arise from DNA breakage, followed by cycles of chromatid fusion, asymmetric mitotic breakage, and replication. Mice deficient in both a nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) DNA repair protein and the p53 tumor suppressor develop lymphomas at an early age harboring amplification of an IgH/c-myc fusion. Here we report that these chromosomal rearrangements are initiated by a recombination activating gene (RAG)-induced DNA cleavage. Subsequent DNA repair events juxtaposing IgH and c-myc are mediated by a break-induced replication pathway. Cycles of breakage-fusion-bridge result in amplification of IgH/c-myc while chromosome stabilization occurs through telomere capture. Thus, mice deficient in NHEJ provide excellent models to study the etiology of unbalanced translocations and amplification events during tumorigenesis.",

    "abstract": "T-cell development is under the tight control of thymic microenvironments. Conversely, the integrity of thymic microenvironments depends on the physical presence of developing thymocytes, a phenomenon designated as 'thymic crosstalk'. We now show, using three types of immunodeficient mice, i.e. CD3(epsilon) transgenic mice, RAG(null) mice and RAG(null)-bone-marrow-transplanted CD3(epsilon) transgenic mice, that the control point in lymphoid development where triple negative (CD3(-),CD4(-),CD8(-)) thymocytes progress from CD44(+)CD25(-) towards CD44(-)CD25(+), influences the development of epithelial cells, critically inducing the extra, third dimension in the organization of the epithelial cells in the cortex. This tertiary configuration of the thymic epithelium is a typical feature for the thymus, enabling lymphostromal interaction during T-cell development. Crosstalk signals at this control point also induce the formation of thymic nurse cells. Moreover, our data indicate that establishment of a thymic cortex is a prerequisite for the development of the thymic medulla. Thus, differentiating thymocytes regulate the morphogenesis of thymic microenvironments in a stepwise fashion.",

    "abstract": "The Rag family of GTPases has been implicated in the TORC1 activation in Drosophila and in mammalian cells in response to amino acids. We have investigated the role of the Rag GTPases Gtr1 and Gtr2 in TORC1 regulation in Schizosaccharomyces pombe. Fission yeast Gtr1 and Gtr2 are non-essential proteins that enhance cell growth in the presence of amino acids in the medium. The function of Gtr1 and Gtr2 in nutrient signaling is further supported by the observation that even in rich medium the deletion of either gene results in the promotion of mating, meiosis and sporulation, consistent with the downregulation of TORC1. We show that Gtr1 and Gtr2 colocalize with TORC1 in vacuoles, where TORC1 is presumably activated. Epistasis analyses indicated that Gtr1 and Gtr2 function downstream of Vam6 and upstream of TORC1 in response to amino acid signals. Our data demonstrate the existence of an evolutionarily conserved pathway with the Vam6 and Gtr1–Gtr2 pathway activating TORC1, which in turns stimulates cell growth and inhibits sexual differentiation.",

    "abstract": "PD-1, a member of the Ig superfamily, was previously isolated from an apoptosis-induced T cell hybridoma 2B4.11 by subtractive hybridization. Expresson of the PD-1 mRNA is restricted to thymus in adult mice. Using an anti-PD-1 mAb (J43), we examined expression of the PD-1 protein during differentiation of thymocytes in normal adult, fetal and RAG-2(-/-) mice with or without anti-CD3 mAb stimulation. While PD-1 was expressed only on 3-5% of total normal thymocytes, approximately 34% of the CD4(-)CD8(-) double-negative (DN) fraction are PD-1(+) cells with two distinct expression levels (low and high). PD-1(high) thymocytes belonged to TCR gammadelta lineage cells. In the DN compartment of the TCR alphabeta lineage, PD-1 expression started at the low level from the CD44(+)CD25(+) stage and the majority of thymocytes expressed PD-1 at the CD44(-)CD25(-) stage in which the thymocytes express TCR beta chains. The anti-CD3epsilon antibody administration augmented the PD-1 expression as well as the differentiation of the CD44(-)CD25(+) DN cells into the CD44(-)CD25(-) DN stage, not only in normal mice but also in RAG-2-deficient mice. The fraction of the PD-1(low) cells in the CD4(+)CD8(+) double-positive (DP) compartment was very small (<5%) but increased by stimulation with the anti-CD3 antibody, although the total number of DP cells was drastically reduced. The results show that PD-1 expression is specifically induced at the stages preceding clonal selection.",

    "title": "Phylogeny and phylogenetic classification of the tyrant flycatchers, cotingas, manakins, and their allies (Aves: Tyrannides)",
    "abstract": "Phylogenetic relationships among the Tyrannides were assessed using over 4000 base pairs of nuclear recombination activating 1 (RAG‐1) and 2 (RAG‐2) DNA sequence data from about 93% of all described genera, which represents the most complete assessment of relationships for this diverse New World radiation to date. With this sampling we propose a significantly expanded interpretation of higher‐level relationships within the group. The Tyrannides are shown to be comprised of six major lineages, all of which represent traditional family‐level taxa (sensu Fitzpatrick, 2004a and Snow, 2004a,b ; del Hoyo et al., 2004 ): (i) manakins (Pipridae); (ii) cotingas (Cotingidae); (iii) the sharpbill (Oxyruncus) + onychorhynchine flycatchers (Onychorhynchini); (iv) tityrines (Tityridae); (v) rhynchocycline flycatchers (Rhynchocyclidae); and (vi) the tyrant flycatchers (Tyrannidae). In addition, the RAG data recovered isolated lineages with uncertain relationships, including Neopipo, Platyrinchus, Piprites, and Tachuris. The Pipridae are the sister‐group to all the other Tyrannides. Within the latter, the clade ((Oxyruncidae + Tityridae) + Cotingidae) is the sister‐group of the Tyrannoidea. Within the Tyrannoidea, the Rhynchocyclidae and their allies are sisters to Neopipo + Tyrannidae. Using our phylogenetic hypothesis, we propose the first comprehensive phylogenetic classification that attempts to achieve isometry between the tree and a classification scheme using subordination and phyletic sequencing. This study thus provides a phylogenetic framework for understanding the evolution of this diverse New World assemblage, and identifies many avenues for further systematic study.",

    "title": "Antibodies against polyethylene glycol produced in animals by immunization with monomethoxy polyethylene glycol modified proteins.",
    "abstract": "Antibodies to polyethylene glycol (PEG) were raised in rabbits by immunization with monomethoxy polyethylene glycol modified ovalbumin (OA), bovine superoxide dismutase (SOD), and ragweed pollen extract (Rag), given in Freund's complete adjuvant (FCA). Immunogenicity depended on the nature of the protein and the degree of modification. With modified OA, in the presence of FCA, the majority of animals showed an anti-PEG response. With modified SOD and Rag only a small proportion of animals responded. In the absence of FCA, modified OA, given s.c., did not elicit any anti-PEG antibody response in rabbits and only a weak response in mice. PEG of MW 10,000 and 100,000 given in FCA was found nonimmunogenic in rabbits, and PEG of MW 5.9 X 10(6), given s.c. to mice, showed no or very poor immunogenic properties. Gel diffusion, heterologous passive anaphylaxis and passive hemagglutination were used to demonstrate anti-PEG antibodies raised to PEG-modified proteins. Specificity was confirmed by hapten inhibition of precipitation, inhibition of passive hemagglutination and cross-reactivity tests. PEG of MW greater than or equal to 4,000 produced specific precipitates, smaller molecules acted as monovalent haptens. From hapten inhibition of precipitation by PEG of MW 300 it appears that the antigenic determinant of PEG may be a sequence of 6-7 -CH2CH2O-units. Anti-PEG antibodies can be used analytically. By gel diffusion, Peg was detected in minimal concentrations of 0.1-1 microgram/ml. The clinical relevance of these findings with regard to therapy with PEG-modified enzymes and allergens in humans remains to be established.",

    "abstract": "E47 is a helix-loop-helix transcription factor that binds to sites in the immunoglobulin heavy-chain and kappa light-chain gene enhancers. Other proteins of this type are involved in cell-type determination. A possible role for E47 in B-cell development was tested by overexpressing a cDNA encoding E47 in the pre-T-cell line 2017. We found a dramatic activation of a germ-line heavy-chain gene transcript in these stable transfectants and an equally large induction of immunoglobulin D-to-J rearrangement, the first recognized step in B-cell development. Germ-line kappa light-chain gene transcription and rearrangement were unaffected, but transcription of the recombination-activating genes RAG-1 and RAG-2 and the lymphoid-specific transcription factor Oct-2 was increased. These T cells did not transcribe their rearranged DJ alleles, however, and failed to progress to the next stage of heavy-chain gene assembly, V-to-DJ rearrangement. Because transcription factor E47 can induce pre-T cells to carry out events of B-cell differentiation, it may be a crucial determinant of the earliest stages of B-cell development.",

    "abstract": "A2A adenosine receptor (A2AR)-expressing bone marrow (BM)-derived cells contribute to the renal protective effect of A2A agonists in renal ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI). We performed IRI in mice lacking T and B cells to determine whether A2AR expressed in CD4+ cells mediate protection from IRI. Rag-1 knockout (KO) mice were protected in comparison to wild-type (WT) mice when subjected to IRI. ATL146e, a selective A2A agonist, did not confer additional protection. IFN-γ is an important early signal in IRI and is thought to contribute to reperfusion injury. Because IFN-γ is produced by kidney cells and T cells we performed IRI in BM chimeras in which the BM of WT mice was reconstituted with BM from IFN-γ KO mice (IFN-γ KO→WT chimera). We observed marked reduction in IRI in comparison to WT→WT chimeras providing additional indirect support for the role of T cells. To confirm the role of CD4+ A2AR in mediating protection from IRI, Rag-1 KO mice were subjected to ischemia-reperfusion. The protection observed in Rag-1 KO mice was reversed in Rag-1 KO mice that were adoptively transferred WT CD4+ cells (WT CD4+→Rag-1 KO) or A2A KO CD4+ cells (A2A KO CD4+→Rag-1 KO). ATL146e reduced injury in WT CD4+→Rag-1 KO mice but not in A2A KO CD4+→Rag-1 KO mice. Rag-1 KO mice reconstituted with CD4+ cells derived from IFN-γ KO mice (IFN-γ CD4+→Rag-1 KO) were protected from IRI; ATL146e conferred no additional protection. These studies demonstrate that CD4+ IFN-γ contributes to IRI and that A2A agonists mediate protection from IRI through action on CD4+ cells.",

    "abstract": "The floral morphology of grass species is distinct from that of typical dicot plants. In order to achieve a better understanding of the molecular basis for this diversion, we isolated RAP1A, RAP1B and RAG, putative rice orthologs for the Arabidopsis class A gene APETALA1 (AP1) and class C gene AGAMOUS (AG). The expression patterns of RAP1A, RAG and OsMADS2, a rice ortholog of the class B gene, were analyzed by in situ hybridization. RAP1A mRNA was expressed in the apical region of the floral meristem at an early stage of spikelet development, and then its expression was localized in developing lemma, palea and lodicules. The OsMADS2 transcript was first observed in the region where stamen primordia are formed. Soon after, OsMADS2 mRNA appeared in the lodicule primordia as well as the stamen primordia, and this RNA accumulation pattern persisted until late stages of floral development. The expression of RAG was observed in stamens and pistils of wild-type young spikelets. These RNA accumulation patterns are mostly similar to those of Arabidopsis class A, B, C genes, supporting the notion that the ABC model may be extended to rice.",

    "abstract": "Amorphic mutations in the recombination activating genes RAG1 and RAG2 have been reported to cause T- B- SCID, whereas hypomorphic mutations led to the expansion of a few autoimmune T cell clones responsible for the Omenn syndrome phenotype. We report here a novel clinical and immunological phenotype associated with recessive RAG1 hypomorphic mutations in 4 patients from 4 different families. The immunological phenotype consists of the oligoclonal expansion of TCR gammadelta T cells combined with TCR alphabeta T cell lymphopenia. The clinical phenotype consists of severe, disseminated CMV infection and autoimmune blood cell manifestations. Repertoire studies suggest that CMV infection, in the setting of this particular T cell immunodeficiency, may have driven the TCR gammadelta T cell clonal expansion. This observation extends the range of clinical and immunological phenotypes associated with RAG mutations, emphasizing the role of the genetic background and microbial environment in determining disease phenotype.",

Schatz Howard Hughes Medical Institute Section of Immunobiology Yale University School of Medicine 300 Cedar Street, Post Box 208011 New Haven, CT 06520-8011, USA Tel. þ1-203-737-2255 Fax: þ1-203-785-3855 E-mail: david.schatz@yale.edu The discovery of V(D)J recombination (1, 2), nearly 30 years ago, triggered a dramatic shift in our thinking about somatic plasticity of the genome and fundamental features of the adaptive immune system. It opened the door to entirely new levels of investigation and understanding of the generation of antigen receptor diversity and lymphocyte development. Work in the 1980s focused on the antigen receptor loci; immunoglobulin heavy (IgH)and light chain-loci and Tcell receptor (TCR) a, b, g, and d loci were discovered and their structures and rearrangements catalogued (3). The next decade was ushered in with the discovery of the recombinationactivating gene 1 (RAG1) and RAG2 (4, 5), and during these 10 years, fundamental aspects of how the RAG proteins initiate V(D)J recombination were elucidated (6). The 1990s also saw the elaboration of the connection between V(D)J recombination and the ubiquitous process of non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) (7), although the mechanisms by which the broken ends in V(D)J recombination get processed and repaired, remain poorly understood. The new decade of the 2000s is likely to be a transitional one in which important advances continue to be made in the study of the RAG proteins and the NHEJ repair process, but in which momentum gathers in the study of the higher order regulation of V(D)J recombination, an area inextricably linked to chromatin structure and to chromosome dynamics. This volume of Immunological Reviews contains 20 articles that discuss the current state of our knowledge in almost all areas relevant to V(D)J recombination and that highlight many of the major unanswered questions that can be glimpsed from our current vantage point. On the theory that it is important to know where you have come from as you consider where you are and where you are going, the volume begins with an article from the Litman laboratory that addresses the evolution of antigen receptor genes and the systems that diversify them. It is plausible that ‘split’ antigen receptor genes first arose through the action of Immunological Reviews 2004 Vol. 200: 5–11 Printed in Denmark. All rights reserved",

    "abstract": "The Ikaros gene encodes a zinc‐finger transcription factor required during early B cell development, as B‐lineage cells are absent in mice lacking Ikaros. Here we describe a novel Ikaros‐targeted mouse line carrying a β‐galactosidase reporter in which low amounts of Ikaros proteins remain expressed. In homozygote animals, B cells are absent during fetal development, but develop postnatally from a reduced pool of precursors. In vitro, the proliferation and differentiation of B‐lineage progenitors are severely impaired. These defects are attenuated in vivo, but bone marrow B cells display an unusual pattern of cell surface marker expression and show decreased transcript levels for TdT, Rag‐1, Rag‐2 and λ5. These abnormalities suggest a partial block atthe proB cell stage of differentiation. In the periphery, mature B cells exhibit a lower activation threshold but form fewer germinal centers in response to antigenic stimulation. Our results show that Ikaros controls multiple aspects of B cell differentiation and function.",

    "title": "A crucial role for HVEM and BTLA in preventing intestinal inflammation",
    "abstract": "The interaction between the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) family member LIGHT and the TNF family receptor herpes virus entry mediator (HVEM) co-stimulates T cells and promotes inflammation. However, HVEM also triggers inhibitory signals by acting as a ligand that binds to B and T lymphocyte attenuator (BTLA), an immunoglobulin super family member. The contribution of HVEM interacting with these two binding partners in inflammatory processes remains unknown. In this study, we investigated the role of HVEM in the development of colitis induced by the transfer of CD4+CD45RBhigh T cells into recombination activating gene (Rag)−/− mice. Although the absence of HVEM on the donor T cells led to a slight decrease in pathogenesis, surprisingly, the absence of HVEM in the Rag−/− recipients led to the opposite effect, a dramatic acceleration of intestinal inflammation. Furthermore, the critical role of HVEM in preventing colitis acceleration mainly involved HVEM expression by radioresistant cells in the Rag−/− recipients interacting with BTLA. Our experiments emphasize the antiinflammatory role of HVEM and the importance of HVEM expression by innate immune cells in preventing runaway inflammation in the intestine.",

    "abstract": "NK lymphocytes participate in both innate and adaptive immunity by their prompt secretion of cytokines including IFN-gamma, which activates macrophages, and by their ability to lyse virally infected cells and tumor cells without prior sensitization. Although these characteristics of NK cells are well documented, little is known about the genetic program that orchestrates NK development or about the signaling pathways that trigger NK effector functions. By crossing NK-deficient common gamma-chain (gammac) and recombinase activating gene (RAG)-2 mutant mice, we have generated a novel alymphoid (B-, T-, and NK-) mouse strain (RAG2/gammac) suitable for NK complementation in vivo. The role of the c-abl proto-oncogene in murine NK cell differentiation has been addressed in hemopoietic chimeras generated using RAG2/gammac mice reconstituted with c-abl-/- fetal liver cells. The phenotypically mature NK cells that developed in the absence of c-abl were capable of lysing tumor targets, recognizing \"missing self,\" and performing Ab-dependent cellular cytotoxicity. Taken together, these results exclude any essential role for c-abl in murine NK cell differentiation in vivo. The RAG2/gammac model thereby provides a novel approach to establish a genetic map of NK cell development.",

    "abstract": "Ship is an Src homology 2 domain containing inositol polyphosphate 5-phosphatase which has been implicated as an important signaling molecule in hematopoietic cells. In B cells, Ship becomes associated with Fcγ receptor IIB (FcγRIIB), a low affinity receptor for the Fc portion of immunoglobulin (Ig)G, and is rapidly tyrosine phosphorylated upon B cell antigen receptor (BCR)–FcγRIIB coligation. The function of Ship in lymphocytes was investigated in Ship−/− recombination-activating gene (Rag)−/− chimeric mice generated from gene-targeted Ship−/− embryonic stem cells. Ship−/−Rag−/− chimeras showed reduced numbers of B cells and an overall increase in basal serum Ig. Ship−/− splenic B cells displayed prolonged Ca2+ influx, increased proliferation in vitro, and enhanced mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activation in response to BCR–FcγRIIB coligation. These results demonstrate that Ship plays an essential role in FcγRIIB-mediated inhibition of BCR signaling, and that Ship is a crucial negative regulator of Ca2+ flux and MAPK activation.",

    "abstract": "To test whether accumulation of naive lymphocytes is sufficient to trigger lymphoid development, we generated mice with islet expression of the chemokine TCA4/SLC. This chemokine is specific for naive lymphocytes and mature dendritic cells (DC) which express the CCR7 receptor. Islets initially developed accumulations of T cells with DC, with scattered B cells at the perimeter. These infiltrates consolidated into organized lymphoid tissue, with high endothelial venules and stromal reticulum. Infiltrate lymphocytes showed a naive CD44low CD25− CD69− phenotype, though half were CD62L negative. When backcrossed to RAG-1 knockout, DC were not recruited. Interestingly, islet lymphoid tissue developed in backcrosses to Ikaros knockout mice despite the absence of normal peripheral nodes. Our results indicate that TCA4/SLC can induce the development and organization of lymphoid tissue through diffential recruitment of T and B lymphocytes and secondary effects on stromal cell development.",

This subset of peripheral B cells fails to emerge in mice that lack nuclear factor (NF)-κBp50. Less drastic reductions in marginal zone B cell numbers are also seen in the spleens of recombination activating gene (Rag)-2−/− mice reconstituted with NF-κBp65−/− fetal liver cells and in c-Rel−/− mice. In contrast, steady-state levels of IgDhi splenic follicular B cells are not significantly reduced in the absence of NF-κBp50, NF-κBp65, or c-Rel. Reconstitution of B cells in Rag-2−/− mice with a mixture of p50−/−/p65−/− fetal liver cells and Rag-2−/− bone marrow cells revealed that the generation of marginal zone B cells requires the expression of NF-κB in developing B cells, as opposed to supporting cells.",

    "title": "Estrogen influences the differentiation, proliferation, and survival of early B-lineage precursors.",
    "abstract": "B lymphocyte production in murine bone marrow is negatively regulated by sex steroids and the aim of this study was to identify early hormone sensitive checkpoints. Estrogen (E2) treatment reduced cmu(+) pre-B cells, a change that occurred concomitantly with decreased Ig gene rearrangements and rag-1 transcripts. Estrogen decreased B lineage precursors in Ig transgenic mice, demonstrating that hormonal regulation is independent of the recombination process. B lineage precursors in Bcl-2 transgenic mice were resistant to estrogen treatment, suggesting that life/death decisions are involved in hormonal regulation. A previously uncharacterized population of CD43(-)cmu(-) B lineage precursors was identified in normal, Ig transgenic, and RAG(-/-) mice after estrogen treatment, revealing that down-regulation of CD43 can occur independent of Ig heavy chain expression. These cells expressed transcripts for both tdt and bcl-2, characteristics of early B-cell precursors. BrdU incorporation analysis revealed that the mitotic activity of early B-lineage cells is reduced in hormone-treated mice. We conclude that sex steroids modulate the production of B-lineage cells by influencing the differentiation, proliferation, and survival of early B-cell precursors. These findings are informative about mechanisms of hormonal regulation, as well as the significance of some differentiation-related events. (Blood. 2000;95:2059-2067)",

    "abstract": "Sexual HIV-1 transmission by vaginal route is the most predominant mode of viral transmission, resulting in millions of new infections every year. In the absence of an effective vaccine, there is an urgent need to develop other alternative methods of pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP). Many novel drugs that are currently approved for clinical use also show great potential to prevent viral sexual transmission when administered systemically. A small animal model that permits rapid preclinical evaluation of potential candidates for their systemic PrEP efficacy will greatly enhance progress in this area of investigation. We have previously shown that RAG-hu humanized mouse model permits HIV-1 mucosal transmission via both vaginal and rectal routes and displays CD4 T cell loss typical to that seen in the human. Thus far systemic PrEP studies have been primarily limited to RT inhibitors exemplified by tenofovir and emtricitabine. In these proof-of-concept studies we evaluated two new classes of clinically approved drugs with different modes of action namely, an integrase inhibitor raltegravir and a CCR5 inhibitor maraviroc as potential systemically administered chemo-prophylactics. Our results showed that oral administration of either of these drugs fully protects against vaginal HIV-1 challenge in the RAG-hu mouse model. Based on these results both these drugs show great promise for further development as orally administered PrEPs.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND & AIMS\nCD1d is a major histocompatibility complex class I-like molecule that presents glycolipid antigens to a subset of natural killer (NK)1.1(+) T cells. These NK T cells exhibit important immunoregulatory functions in several autoimmune disease models.\n\n\nMETHODS\nTo investigate whether CD1d and NK T cells have a similar role in intestinal inflammation, the effects of the glycolipid, alpha-galactosylceramide (alpha-GalCer), on dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced colitis were examined. Wild-type (WT), CD1d(-/-), and RAG(-/-) mice were examined for their response to either alpha-GalCer or the control analogue, alpha-mannosylceramide (alpha-ManCer).\n\n\nRESULTS\nWT mice, but not CD1d(-/-) and RAG(-/-) mice, receiving alpha-GalCer had a significant improvement in DSS-induced colitis based on body weight, bleeding, diarrhea, and survival when compared with those receiving alpha-ManCer. Elimination of NK T cells through antibody-mediated depletion resulted in a reduction of the effect of alpha-GalCer. Furthermore, adoptive transfer of NK T cells preactivated by alpha-GalCer, but not alpha-ManCer, resulted in diminished colitis. Using a fluorescent-labeled analogue of alpha-GalCer, confocal microscopy localized alpha-GalCer to the colonic surface epithelium of WT but not CD1d(-/-) mice, indicating alpha-GalCer binds CD1d in the intestinal epithelium and may be functionally active at this site.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThese results show an important functional role for NK T cells, activated by alpha-GalCer in a CD1d-restricted manner, in regulating intestinal inflammation.",

In the NFV environment, especially when supporting multicast services over the VNs, reliability is a critical requirement since the failure of one virtual node can cause the malfunction of multiple nodes that receive multicasting data from it. In this paper, we study for the first time to the best of our knowledge how to efficiently map VNs for multicast services over both general IP networks and orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM)-based elastic optical networks (EONs) while taking into consideration the max-min fairness in terms of reliability among distinct VNs. For general IP networks, we propose a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model to determine the upper bound on the reliability with max-min fairness. In addition, an efficient heuristic, namely a reliability-aware genetic (RAG) algorithm, is developed to address reliable multicast VN mapping with a low computational complexity. By encoding multicast tree construction and link mapping into the process of path selection, taking into consideration the reliability with max-min fairness, and the networking reliability factors during mutation, RAG can globally optimize the reliability and fairness of all the multicast VN requests. For OFDM-based EONs, we extend the MILP (RAG) to optical-MILP [(O-MILP) optical RAG (O-RAG)] by considering the most efficient modulation format selection strategy, spectrum continuity, and conflict constraints. Through extensive simulations, we demonstrate that RAG (O-RAG) achieves close to the optimal reliability fairness with a much lower time complexity than the MILP (O-MILP) model. In particular, the path reliability-based mutation strategy in RAG (O-RAG) yields a significant performance improvement over other heuristic solutions in terms of reliability fairness, bandwidth (spectrum) consumption, and transmission delay.",

    "title": "Heligmosomoides polygyrus Infection Can Inhibit Colitis through Direct Interaction with Innate Immunity",
    "abstract": "Less developed countries have a low incidence of immunological diseases like inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), perhaps prevented by the high prevalence of helminth infections in their populations. In the Rag IL-10−/− T cell transfer model of colitis, Heligmosomoides polygyrus, an intestinal helminth, prevents and reverses intestinal inflammation. This model of colitis was used to explore the importance of innate immunity in H. polygyrus protection from IBD. Rag mice briefly exposed to H. polygyrus before reconstitution with IL-10−/− colitogenic T cells are protected from colitis. Exposure to H. polygyrus before introduction of IL-10−/− and OT2 T cells reduced the capacity of the intestinal mucosa to make IFN-γ and IL-17 after either anti-CD3 mAb or OVA stimulation. This depressed cytokine response was evident even in the absence of colitis, suggesting that the downmodulation in proinflammatory cytokine secretion was not just secondary to improvement in intestinal inflammation. Following H. polygyrus infection, dendritic cells (DCs) from the lamina propria of Rag mice displayed decreased expression of CD80 and CD86, and heightened expression of plasmacytoid dendritic cell Ag-1 and CD40. They were also less responsive to lamina proprias, producing less IL-12p40 and IL-10. Also diminished was their capacity to present OVA to OT2 T cells. These experiments infer that H. polygyrus does not require direct interactions with T or B cells to render animals resistant to colitis. DCs have an important role in driving both murine and human IBD. Data suggest that phenotypic alternations in mucosal DC function are part of the regulatory process.",

    "abstract": "We demonstrate a role for immune functions in the spontaneous remyelination of central nervous system (CNS) axons after lysolecithin‐induced demyelination in the spinal cord. Rag‐1–deficient mice lack both B cells and T cells and show significantly reduced spontaneous remyelination compared with control mice of matching genetic background. Mice lacking or depleted of either CD4+ T cells or CD8+ T cells also exhibit reduced remyelination. These data indicate that T cells are necessary for efficient CNS remyelination. Thus, general nonspecific immunosuppression as a therapeutic approach for the treatment of CNS injury and demyelinating disease may have undesirable effects on subsequent tissue repair.

    "abstract": "The aging of cellulose, the main constituent of paper, is due to depolymerization of cellulose fibers and is promoted by acid pH. Paper deacidification is a fundamental process for the conservation and restoration of probably the most important material used to transmit cultural heritage. Several methods are currently used for paper deacidification. We applied nanotechnologies to produce kinetically stable dispersions of nano- and micron-sized calcium hydroxide particles in alcohol media. Although calcium hydroxide possesses the best deacidification properties, it has never been used so far as dispersion in nonaqueous media. Calcium hydroxide particles, once deposited onto paper cellulose fibers, deacidify them and react with carbon dioxide from the air, forming a calcium carbonate reservoir on the paper fibers. This process allows a long-term control of paper pH, with excellent deacidification properties. Deacidification of 14th, 17th, 19th, and 20th century acid yellowed paper samples coming from rag an...",

    "title": "EMT reversal in human cancer cells after IR knockdown in hyperinsulinemic mice.",
    "abstract": "Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is associated with increased cancer risk and cancer-related mortality. Data herein show that we generated an immunodeficient hyperinsulinemic mouse by crossing the Rag1(-/-) mice, which have no mature B or T lymphocytes, with the MKR mouse model of T2D to generate the Rag1(-/-) (Rag/WT) and Rag1(-/-)/MKR(+/+) (Rag/MKR) mice. The female Rag/MKR mice are insulin resistant and have significantly higher nonfasting plasma insulin levels compared with the Rag/WT controls. Therefore, we used these Rag/MKR mice to investigate the role of endogenous hyperinsulinemia on human cancer progression. In this study, we show that hyperinsulinemia in the Rag/MKR mice increases the expression of mesenchymal transcription factors, TWIST1 and ZEB1, and increases the expression of the angiogenesis marker, vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA). We also show that silencing the insulin receptor (IR) in the human LCC6 cancer cells leads to decreased tumor growth and metastases, suppression of mesenchymal markers vimentin, SLUG, TWIST1 and ZEB1, suppression of angiogenesis markers, VEGFA and VEGFD, and re-expression of the epithelial marker, E-cadherin. The data in this paper demonstrate that IR knockdown in primary tumors partially reverses the growth-promoting effects of hyperinsulinemia as well as highlighting the importance of the insulin receptor signaling pathway in cancer progression, and more specifically in epithelial-mesenchymal transition.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE\nWe investigated the correlation between tumor angiogenic activity and progression of gastric carcinoma using immunohistochemical staining with antifactor VIII-related antigen (F-VIII RAg) antibody.\n\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nOne hundred twenty-four specimens resected from patients with gastric carcinoma were investigated by staining with a monoclonal antibody against F-VIII RAg. Correlations between the microvessel count (the mean number of microvessels in the five areas of highest vascular density at 200 times magnification), various clinicopathologic factors, and prognosis were studied.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe microvessel count increased with histologic stage. The microvessel count was significantly higher in patients with lymph node metastases than in those without such metastases. Moreover, in patients with a high microvessel count (> or = 16), prognosis was significantly poorer than in those with low count (< 16). Multivariate analysis indicated that the microvessel count is an independent prognostic factor in patients with gastric cancer. According to the mode of recurrence, the frequency of hepatic metastases was significantly increased in patients with a high count.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nMicrovessel count may be a good prognostic indicator and may be useful as a predictor for the mode of recurrence in patients with gastric carcinoma.",

    "title": "Infected splenic dendritic cells are sufficient for prion transmission to the CNS in mouse scrapie.",
    "abstract": "Transmissible spongiform encephalopathies display long incubation periods at the beginning of which the titer of infectious agents (prions) increases in peripheral lymphoid organs. This \"replication\" leads to a progressive invasion of the CNS. Follicular dendritic cells appear to support prion replication in lymphoid follicles. However, the subsequent steps of neuroinvasion remain obscure. CD11c(+) dendritic cells, an unrelated cell type, are candidate vectors for prion propagation. We found a high infectivity titer in splenic dendritic cells from prion-infected mice, suggesting that dendritic cells carry infection. To test this hypothesis, we injected RAG-1(0/0) mice intravenously with live spleen cell subsets from scrapie-infected donors. Injection of infected dendritic cells induced scrapie without accumulation of prions in the spleen. These results suggest that CD11c(+) dendritic cells can propagate prions from the periphery to the CNS in the absence of any additional lymphoid element.",

    "abstract": "Background: The heterodimeric GTR GTPase is a key regulator in the amino acid mediated TORC1 pathway. Results: The structure of Gtr1pGTP-Gtr2pGDP reveals a large conformational change in comparison with that of Gtr1pGMPPNP-Gtr2pGMPPNP. Conclusion: The heterodimeric GTR GTPase serves as a novel molecular switch regulating the Raptor binding affinity. Significance: The structural information leads to a better understanding of the regulatory mechanism of the GTR GTPase. The heterodimeric Rag GTPases consisting of RagA (or RagB) and RagC (or RagD) are the key regulator activating the target of rapamycin complex 1 (TORC1) in response to the level of amino acids. The heterodimer between GTP-loaded RagA/B and GDP-loaded RagC/D is the most active form that binds Raptor and leads to the activation of TORC1. Here, we present the crystal structure of Gtr1pGTP-Gtr2pGDP, the active yeast Rag GTPase heterodimer. The structure reveals that GTP-to-GDP conversion on Gtr2p results in a large conformational transition of this subunit, including a large scale rearrangement of a long segment whose corresponding region in RagA is involved in binding to Raptor. In addition, the two GTPase domains of the heterodimer are brought to contact with each other, but without causing any conformational change of the Gtr1p subunit. These features explain how the nucleotide-bound statuses of the two GTPases subunits switch the Raptor binding affinity on and off.",

    "abstract": "The recent description of a Lin−AA4.1+CD19+B220Lo/− B1-specified progenitor (B1P) population in adult marrow adds support for the argument that these unique B cells arise from a distinct lineage. However, the origins of B1P were not investigated and their developmental relationships to conventional B2 cells remain unclear. We now report that B1P development is IL-7Rα-dependent, and negatively regulated by Bruton tyrosine kinase. Lymphoid characteristics of B1P were further studied with recombination activating gene (RAG)-1/GFP knock-in, RAG-1/Cre reporter, and VEX transgenic mice. Our results reveal that they are heterogeneous with respect to lymphocyte affiliation. RAG-1+ early lymphoid progenitors and Lin−Sca-1+cKitLoIL-7Rα+ common lymphoid progenitors from adult marrow efficiently generated CD19+CD45R/B220Lo/− cells in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, early lymphoid progenitors and common lymphoid progenitors produced significant numbers of peritoneal CD11b+CD5+ B1a and CD11b+CD5− B1b cells in vivo. Finally, 2-step transplantation experiments established a differentiation pathway between conventional lymphoid progenitors, B1P, and mature B1 lymphocytes. Thus, our findings indicate that at least some B1P can be produced in adult bone marrow from primitive B2 progenitors, and suggest a developmental relationship between the major categories of B lymphocytes.",

    "title": "An Innate Response to Allogeneic Nonself Mediated by Monocytes1",
    "abstract": "The mammalian innate immune system has evolved diverse strategies to distinguish self from microbial nonself. How the innate immune system distinguishes self-tissues from those of other members of the same species (allogeneic nonself) is less clear. To address this question, we studied the cutaneous hypersensitivity response of lymphocyte-deficient RAG−/− mice to spleen cells transplanted from either allogeneic or syngeneic RAG−/− donors. We found that RAG−/− mice mount a specific response to allogeneic cells characterized by swelling and infiltration of the skin with host monocytes/macrophages and neutrophils. The response required prior priming with allogeneic splenocytes or skin grafts and exhibited features of memory as it could be elicited at least 4 wk after immunization. Neither depletion of host NK cells nor rechallenging immunized mice with F1 hybrid splenocytes inhibited the response, indicating that the response is not mediated by NK cells. Depletion of host monocytes/macrophages or neutrophils at the time of rechallenge significantly diminished the response and, importantly, the adoptive transfer of monocytes from alloimmunized RAG−/− mice conferred alloimmunity to naive RAG−/− hosts. Unlike NK- and T cell-dependent alloresponses, monocyte-mediated alloimmunity could be elicited only when donor and responder mice differed at non-MHC loci. These observations indicate that monocytes mount a response to allogeneic nonself, a function not previously attributed to them, and suggest the existence of mammalian innate allorecognition strategies distinct from detection of missing self-MHC molecules by NK cells.",

    "title": "Phylogeny and comparative substitution rates of frogs inferred from sequences of three nuclear genes.",
    "abstract": "Phylogenetic relationships among major clades of anuran amphibians were studied using partial sequences of three nuclear protein coding genes, Rag-1, Rag-2, and rhodopsin in 26 frog species from 18 families. The concatenated nuclear data set comprised 2,616 nucleotides and was complemented by sequences of the mitochondrial 12S and 16S rRNA genes for analyses of evolutionary rates. Separate and combined analyses of the nuclear markers supported the monophyly of modern frogs (Neobatrachia), whereas they did not provide support for the monophyly of archaic frog lineages (Archaeobatrachia), contrary to previous studies based on mitochondrial data. The Neobatrachia contain two well supported clades that correspond to the subfamilies Ranoidea (Hyperoliidae, Mantellidae, Microhylidae, Ranidae, and Rhacophoridae) and Hyloidea (Bufonidae, Hylidae, Leptodactylidae, and Pseudidae). Two other families (Heleophrynidae and Sooglossidae) occupied basal positions and probably represent ancient relicts within the Neobatrachia, which had been less clearly indicated by previous mitochondrial analyses. Branch lengths of archaeobatrachians were consistently shorter in all separate analyses, and nonparametric rate smoothing indicated accelerated substitution rates in neobatrachians. However, relative rate tests confirmed this tendency only for mitochondrial genes. In contrast, nuclear gene sequences from our study and from an additional GenBank survey showed no clear phylogenetic trends in terms of differences in rates of molecular evolution. Maximum likelihood trees based on Rag-1 and using only one neobatrachian and one archaeobatrachian sequence, respectively, even had longer archaeobatrachian branches averaged over all pairwise comparisons. More data are necessary to understand the significance of a possibly general assignation of short branches to basal and species-poor taxa by tree-reconstruction algorithms.",

    "title": "Separation of Notch1 Promoted Lineage Commitment and Expansion/Transformation in Developing T Cells",
    "abstract": "Notch1 signaling is required for T cell development. We have previously demonstrated that expression of a dominant active Notch1 (ICN1) transgene in hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) leads to thymic-independent development of CD4+CD8+ double-positive (DP) T cells in the bone marrow (BM). To understand the function of Notch1 in early stages of T cell development, we assessed the ability of ICN1 to induce extrathymic T lineage commitment in BM progenitors from mice that varied in their capacity to form a functional pre-T cell receptor (TCR). Whereas mice repopulated with ICN1 transduced HSCs from either recombinase deficient (Rag-2−/−) or Src homology 2 domain–containing leukocyte protein of 76 kD (SLP-76)−/− mice failed to develop DP BM cells, recipients of ICN1-transduced Rag-2−/− progenitors contained two novel BM cell populations indicative of pre-DP T cell development. These novel BM populations are characterized by their expression of CD3ε and pre-Tα mRNA and the surface proteins CD44 and CD25. In contrast, complementation of Rag-2−/− mice with a TCRβ transgene restored ICN1-induced DP development in the BM within 3 wk after BM transfer (BMT). At later time points, this population selectively and consistently gave rise to T cell leukemia. These findings demonstrate that Notch signaling directs T lineage commitment from multipotent progenitor cells; however, both expansion and leukemic transformation of this population are dependent on T cell–specific signals associated with development of DP thymocytes.",

    "title": "Round-robin Arbiter Design and Generation",
    "abstract": "In this paper, we introduce a Round-robin Arbiter Generator (RAG) tool. The RAG tool can generate a design for a Bus Arbiter (BA). The BA is able to handle the exact number of bus masters for both on-chip and off-chip buses. RAG can also generate a distributed and parallel hierarchical Switch Arbiter (SA). The first contribution of this paper is the automated generation of a round-robin token passing BA to reduce time spent on arbiter design. The generated arbiter is fair, fast, and has a low and predictable worst-case wait time. The second contribution of this paper is the design and integration of a distributed fast arbiter, e.g., for a terabit switch, based on 2/spl times/2 and 4/spl times/4 switch arbiters (SAs). Using a .25/spl mu/ TSMC standard cell library from LEDA Systems [10, 14], we show the arbitration time of a 256/spl times/256 SA for a terabit switch and demonstrate that the SA generated by RAG meets the time constraint to achieve approximately six terabits of throughput in a typical network switch design. Furthermore, our generated SA performs better than the Ping-Pong Arbiter and Programmable Priority Encoder by a factor of 1.9/spl times/ and 2.4/spl times/, respectively.",

    "abstract": "Growth factors and nutrients regulate the mTORC1 [mammalian (or mechanistic) target of rapamycin complex 1] by different mechanisms. The players that link growth factors and mTORC1 activation have been known for several years and mouse models have validated its relevance for human physiology and disease. In contrast with the picture for growth factor signalling, the means by which nutrient availability leads to mTORC1 activation have remained elusive until recently, with the discovery of the Rag GTPases upstream of mTORC1. The Rag GTPases recruit mTORC1 to the outer lysosomal surface, where growth factor signalling and nutrient signalling converge on mTORC1 activation. A mouse model of constitutive RagA activity has revealed qualitative differences between growth-factor- and nutrient-dependent regulation of mTORC1. Regulation of mTORC1 activity by the Rag GTPases in vivo is key for enduring early neonatal starvation, showing its importance for mammalian physiology.",

    "title": "Influence of immunoglobulin heavy- and light-chain expression on B-cell differentiation.",
    "abstract": "To study the influence of immunoglobulin heavy-chain (HC) and light-chain (LC) expression in promoting B-cell differentiation, we have introduced functional immunoglobulin HC and/or LC transgenes into the recombinase activating gene-2-deficient background (RAG-2-/-). RAG-2-/- mice do not undergo endogenous V(D)J rearrangement events and, therefore, are blocked in B- and T-cell development at the early pro-B- and pro-T-cell stages. Introduction of immunoglobulin HC transgenes into the RAG-2-/- background promotes the development of a B-lineage cell population that phenotypically has the characteristics of pre-B cells. We have shown further that this population has altered growth characteristics as measured by interleukin-7 responsiveness in culture. Bone marrow cells from immunoglobulin HC transgenic RAG-2-/- mice have up-regulated expression of germ-line kappa LC gene transcripts and down-regulated expression of lambda 5 surrogate LCs (SLCs). Although mu HC/SLC complexes are detectable intracellularly in HC/RAG-2-/- pre-B-cell populations, HC expression is not readily detectable on the surface of these cells. lambda LC RAG-2-/- mice had a bone marrow B-lineage cell phenotype indistinguishable from that of RAG-2-/- littermates, indicating that LC expression by itself has no influence on pro-B cell differentiation. Strikingly, simultaneous introduction of mu HC and lambda LC transgenes into RAG-2-/- mice led to the generation of a substantial population of \"monoclonal\" peripheral B-cells that were functional with regard to immunoglobulin secretion, indicating that T cells or diverse immunoglobulin repertoires are not necessary for peripheral B-cell development.",

    "title": "Intra-epithelial lymphocytes. Evidence for regional specialization and extrathymic T cell maturation in the human gut epithelium.",
    "abstract": "The human gut epithelium is a unique immunological compartment, containing substantial amounts of intra-epithelial lymphocytes (IEL) with unknown functions. In this study we show that distinct and unusual subpopulations of IEL are present at different levels of human intestine. IEL phenotypes in normal jejunum, ileum and colon were compared using immunoflow cytometry and immunohistochemistry. The expression of mRNA for recombination-activating gene-1 (RAG-1) in IEL from all three levels was compared using reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction, and the morphology of IEL in situ was determined using immunoelectron microscopy. Surface marker profiles of isolated intestinal epithelial cells at all three levels were also investigated. On average the proportion of TCR gamma delta IEL was comparable in jejunum than ileum and colon and varied in phenotype with gut level. CD4-CD8-TCR alpha beta IEL dominated in colon but were absent in jejunum. CD8+ TCR alpha beta IEL were present at all levels but only in jejunum did they constitute the majority of all IEL. CD4+ TCR alpha beta IEL were present in similar frequencies at all levels of the gut. In general, the majority of IEL had an activated phenotype (CD45RO+, alpha E beta 7+). Furthermore, IEL exhibited phenotypes which are rare in peripheral blood. The thymocyte markers CD1a and CD1c as well as the NK cell marker CD56 were expressed on a fraction of TCR alpha beta and TCR gamma delta IEL. A small population of 'null' cells (CD45+ TCR/CD#-CD20-CD14-CD15- cells) was also present at equal proportions along the gut. Jejunal but not colonic IEL expressed RAG-1 mRNA suggesting that extrathymic T cell maturation occurs in the epithelium of small intestine. RAG-1 was expressed in CD2+TCR/CD3- and CD3+/TCR-IEL. Ultrastructurally, IEL often formed small clusters and intimate contacts with epithelial cells, suggesting cell cooperation within the epithelium. Some IEL had pseudopodium-like extensions penetrating the epithelial basement membrane suggesting transmigration. Epithelial cells in small intestine but not colon expressed heat shock protein 60 and HLA-DR. CD1a, CD1b and CD1c were not expressed on intestinal epithelial cells at any level. The distinct surface marker profiles of IEL and epithelial cells along small and large intestine suggest functional regional specialization and are compatible with the hypothesis that TCR alpha beta IEL participate in immune reactions to lumenal antigens while TCR gamma delta IEL perform surveillance of the epithelium.",

    "abstract": "Subspecies of Trypanosoma brucei cause severe brain diseases after penetration of the blood-brain barrier. We investigated whether cytokines that modulate inflammatory cell infiltration into the brain also influence T. brucei neuroinvasion. Migration of a rodent pathogenic T. brucei strain from the cerebral blood vessels into the brain parenchyma was impeded in IFN-gamma(-/-), IFN-gamma receptor(-/-) (IFN-gammaR(-/-)), IL-12p40(-/-), and recombinant activating gene-1(-/-) (RAG-1(-/-)) mice as compared with their WT littermates despite higher levels of parasitemia in the mutant strains. Parasites accumulated in the perivascular compartment, confined between the endothelial and the parenchymal basement membranes, in certain areas of the brains of IFN-gamma(-/-), IFN-gammaR(-/-), and RAG-1(-/-) mice. This accumulation occurred around endothelial basement membranes containing the laminin alpha4 chain, while blood vessels showing robust laminin alpha5 chain immunostaining were not associated with parasite infiltration. The number of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells infiltrating the brain parenchyma was also reduced in the IFN-gamma(-/-) and IFN-gammaR(-/-) mice. Our findings suggest that lymphocyte-derived IFN-gamma facilitates trypanosome penetration across cerebral blood vessels and that the site of penetration is determined by the composition of the basement membranes of these vessels.",

    "title": "NF-κB and AKT signaling prevent DNA damage in transformed pre-B cells by suppressing RAG1/2 expression and activity.",
    "abstract": "In developing lymphocytes, expression and activity of the recombination activation gene protein 1 (RAG1) and RAG2 endonuclease complex is tightly regulated to ensure ordered recombination of the immunoglobulin genes and to avoid genomic instability. Aberrant RAG activity has been implicated in the generation of secondary genetic events in human B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemias (B-ALLs), illustrating the oncogenic potential of the RAG complex. Several layers of regulation prevent collateral genomic DNA damage by restricting RAG activity to the G1 phase of the cell cycle. In this study, we show a novel pathway that suppresses RAG expression in cycling-transformed mouse pre-B cells and human pre-B B-ALL cells that involves the negative regulation of FOXO1 by nuclear factor κB (NF-κB). Inhibition of NF-κB in cycling pre-B cells resulted in upregulation of RAG expression and recombination activity, which provoked RAG-dependent DNA damage. In agreement, we observe a negative correlation between NF-κB activity and the expression of RAG1, RAG2, and TdT in B-ALL patients. Our data suggest that targeting NF-κB in B-ALL increases the risk of RAG-dependent genomic instability.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE\nTo study the clinical importance of the reverse attenuation gradient (RAG) sign in patients with occlusive coronary artery disease observed with coronary computed tomographic (CT) angiography.\n\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nAll patients provided written informed consent, and the institutional review board committee approved the study protocol. Eighty consecutive patients (mean age, 67.1 years ± 12.1 [standard deviation]; range, 35-87 years; 62 men [mean age, 65.8 years ± 12.5; range, 35-86 years] and 18 women [mean age, 71.7 years ± 9.3; range, 58-87 years]) were enrolled prospectively in this study. The RAG sign was defined as the reverse intraluminal opacification gradient of vessels distal to the occlusive lesions, which has lower attenuation in the proximal segment and gradually increased attenuation along the vessel. Other parameters, such as lesion length and bridging collateral vessels visible at coronary CT angiography, were recorded. Mann-Whitney Wilcoxon and Fisher exact tests were used for comparison.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThere were 94 occlusive lesions. Invasive coronary angiography was used to confirm 49 chronic total occlusions (CTOs) and 45 subtotal occlusions (SOs). The CTO group had the RAG sign significantly more frequently than did the SO group (65% [32 of 49] vs 7% [three of 45]; P < .001). Similarly, significant difference of measurements of the attenuation gradient (5.1 HU/10 mm ± 13.4 vs -13.4 HU/10 mm ± 8.7; P < .001) and lesion length (23.6 mm ± 22.7 vs 6 mm ± 3; P < .001) was noted between the groups. Bridging collateral vessels were present in only four cases of CTO at coronary CT angiography. All segments with RAG at coronary CT angiography were shown by means of invasive coronary angiography to be supplied by retrograde collateral vessels. When a combination of all those parameters was used for diagnosis of CTO, sensitivity and specificity were 90% (44 of 49) and 93% (42 of 45), respectively.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThe RAG sign represents the retrograde collateral flow distal to an occlusive lesion. This sign is highly specific for CTO and helps to differentiate CTO from SO.",

    "abstract": "While the significance of natural Ab is not entirely clear, one proposed role is clearance of bacterial Ags. To determine whether natural Ab was involved in clearance of endotoxin, we have examined novel strains of mice with either a total or selective deficiency in Ig. Recombinase-activating gene-2 (RAG-2(-/-))-deficient mice, which have no serum Ig due to arrested development of B cells at the pro-B stage, demonstrate increased sensitivity to endotoxin that correlates with an impaired clearance. When RAG-2(-/-) mice are reconstituted with pooled sera from normal mice, both survival and clearance of circulating endotoxin are enhanced. To further define the nature of the protective Ab, Bruton's tyrosine kinase (Btk)-deficient mice were characterized in the high dose LPS model. Like RAG-2(-/-) mice, they are highly sensitive to endotoxin and have an impaired clearance of LPS. Reconstitution of Btk(-/-) mice, which have reduced levels of IgG3 and IgM, with purified normal mouse IgM dramatically enhances their ability to clear endotoxin compared with mock (saline)-reconstituted littermates. The cellular source of natural anti-LPS IgM was identified as the peritoneal-residing B-1 cell by enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISPOT) assay. Taken together, these studies demonstrate the important role of natural Ab and complement in the clearance of pathogenic substances from the circulation.",

    "title": "H3K4me3 induces allosteric conformational changes in the DNA-binding and catalytic regions of the V(D)J recombinase",
    "abstract": "Significance Accessibility of antigen receptor gene segments to recombination-activating gene (RAG), the V(D)J recombinase, is correlated with marks of active chromatin. One mark, histone H3 at lysine 4 (H3K4me3), binds to a plant homeodomain (PHD) in the RAG-2 subunit; mutations that abolish binding of the PHD to H3K4me3 also impair V(D)J recombination. Engagement of H3K4me3 by RAG-2 enhances substrate binding and catalysis, which are functions of RAG-1. We show that H3K4me3 acts through the PHD to induce conformational changes in an autoinhibitory domain residing within RAG-2 as well as in substrate-binding and catalytic regions of RAG-1. Our data suggest that H3K4me3 promotes displacement of the autoinhibitory domain as well as concomitant conformational alterations in RAG-1 that favor increased substrate affinity and catalytic rate. V(D)J recombination is initiated by the recombination-activating gene (RAG) recombinase, consisting of RAG-1 and RAG-2 subunits. The susceptibility of gene segments to cleavage by RAG is associated with histone modifications characteristic of active chromatin, including trimethylation of histone H3 at lysine 4 (H3K4me3). Binding of H3K4me3 by a plant homeodomain (PHD) in RAG-2 stimulates substrate binding and catalysis, which are functions of RAG-1. This has suggested an allosteric mechanism in which information regarding occupancy of the RAG-2 PHD is transmitted to RAG-1. To determine whether the conformational distribution of RAG is altered by H3K4me3, we mapped changes in solvent accessibility of cysteine thiols by differential isotopic chemical footprinting. Binding of H3K4me3 to the RAG-2 PHD induces conformational changes in RAG-1 within a DNA-binding domain and in the ZnH2 domain, which acts as a scaffold for the catalytic center. Thus, engagement of H3K4me3 by the RAG-2 PHD is associated with dynamic conformational changes in RAG-1, consistent with allosteric control by active chromatin.",

    "abstract": "We wished to determine whether CD4+ T cells could reject a skin graft that was discordant for a single minor transplantation Ag in the absence of CD8+ T cells or Ab. Transgenic A1(M) mice were constructed that express the rearranged V beta 8.2 and V alpha 10 TCR genes from a T cell clone that is specific for the male Ag (H-Y) in the context of H2-Ek. In addition, the RAG-1(-/-) background was bred onto these mice to eliminate any endogenous TCR rearrangements. As expected, clonal deletion was found to be complete in the thymus of male A1(M) x RAG-1(-/-) mice, while only CD4+ T cells were positively selected and found in the periphery of females. Female A1(M) x RAG-1(-/-) mice were able to rapidly reject (in <14 days) male (but not female) skin grafts in a CD4-dependent fashion. After multiple grafts, it was confirmed that no CD8+ T cells or surface Ig+ B cells were present. An immunofluorescent analysis of spleen cells after grafting showed that the majority of T cells expressed activation markers (CD44, CD25, and intracytoplasmic IL-2) and a significant proportion were making IFN-gamma and IL-4. Surprisingly, the transfer of either Th1 or Th2 CD4+ T cell lines from these mice into T cell-depleted recipients was sufficient to cause a specific rejection of male skin.",

    "title": "Lymphocyte development in fish and amphibians",
    "abstract": "Summary: Recently, molecular markers such as recombination activating genes (RAG), terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT), stem cell leukemia hematopoletic transcription factor (SCL), Ikaros and gata‐binding protein (Gata) ‐family members have been isolated and characterized from key lower vertebrates, adding to our growing knowledge of lymphopolesis in ectotherms. In all gnathostomes there appear to be two main embryonic locations derived from the early mesoderm, both intra‐ and extraembryonic, which contribute to primitive and dermitive hematopolesis based upon their differential expression of SCL, Gaia‐1, Gata‐2 and tnyeloblasto‐sis oncogene (c‐myb). In teleosts. a unique intraembryonic location for hematopoletic stem cells termed the intermediate cell mass (ICM) of Oellacter appears to be responsible for primitive or definitive hematopolesis depending upon the species being investigated. In Xenopus, elegant grafting studies in combination with specific molecular markers has led to a better definition of the roles that ventral blood islands and dorsal lateral plate play in amphibian hematopolesis, that of primitive and deffinitive lymphopolesis. After the early embryonic contribution to hematopolesis. specialized tissues must assume the role of providing the proper microenvironment for T and B‐lymphocyte development from progenitor stem cells. In all gnathostomes, the thymus is the major site for T‐cell maturation as evidenced by strong expression of developmental markers such as Ikaros, Rag and TdT plus expression of T‐cell specific markers such as T‐cell receptor β and lck. In this respect, several zebrafish mutants have provided new insights on the development of the thymopoletic environment. On the other band, the sites for B‐cell lymphopolesis are less clear among the lower vertebrates. In elasmobranchs, the spleen, Leydig's organ and the spiral valve may all contribute to B‐cell development, although pre‐B cells have yet to be fully addressed in fish. In teleosts, the kidney is undeniably the major source of B‐cell development based upon functional, cellular and molecular indices. Amphibians appear to use several different sites (spleen, bone marrow and/or kidney) depending upon the species in question.",

    "title": "Ataxia telangiectasia mutated (Atm) and DNA-PKcs kinases have overlapping activities during chromosomal signal joint formation",
    "abstract": "Lymphocyte antigen receptor gene assembly occurs through the process of V(D)J recombination, which is initiated when the RAG endonuclease introduces DNA DSBs at two recombining gene segments to form broken DNA coding end pairs and signal end pairs. These paired DNA ends are joined by proteins of the nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ) pathway of DSB repair to form a coding joint and signal joint, respectively. RAG DSBs are generated in G1-phase developing lymphocytes, where they activate the ataxia telangiectasia mutated (Atm) and DNA-PKcs kinases to orchestrate diverse cellular DNA damage responses including DSB repair. Paradoxically, although Atm and DNA-PKcs both function during coding joint formation, Atm appears to be dispensible for signal joint formation; and although some studies have revealed an activity for DNA-PKcs during signal joint formation, others have not. Here we show that Atm and DNA-PKcs have overlapping catalytic activities that are required for chromosomal signal joint formation and for preventing the aberrant resolution of signal ends as potentially oncogenic chromosomal translocations.",

    "abstract": "IL‐12 exerts a potent anti‐tumor effect, which is possibly mediated by multiple mechanisms including activation of NK and NKT cells, induction of cytotoxic T lymphocytes, and inhibition of angiogenesis. In the present study, we characterized the cytotoxic effector cells and mechanisms responsible for the anti‐metastatic effect of IL‐12. Administration of IL‐12 had a comparable inhibitory effect on experimental lung metastasis of B16 melanoma cells in wild‐type C57BL / 6 mice and RAG‐2 − / − mice that lack T and NKT cells, which was abolished by depletion of NK cells. Cytotoxic activity of liver and splenic mononuclear cells against B16 was induced by IL‐12 administration in RAG‐2 − / − mice at a level comparable to that in wild‐type mice, which was also abolished by depletion of NK cells. Moreover, the anti‐metastatic effect of IL‐12 was abrogated by perforin deficiency, but not by Fas ligand deficiency, in association with a lack of IL‐12‐induced cytotoxic activity of liver and splenic mononuclear cells against B16. These results suggest that perforin‐dependent cytotoxicity of IL‐12‐activated NK cells is sufficient for the anti‐metastatic effect of IL‐12.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Control of the acute phase of Trypanosoma cruzi infections is critically dependent on cytokine-mediated macrophage activation to intracellular killing. We investigated the roles of IL-10, TNF, IFN-γ, and IL-12 in the control of parasitism by innate and specific immunity. Mice with disrupted IL-10 genes (IL-10 KO) infected with Y strain T. cruzi have lower parasite numbers in the blood and tissues and higher IFN-γ and nitric oxide (NO) production by spleen cells than wild type (WT) mice. Treatment of IL-10 KO and WT mice with recombinant IL-10 resulted in increased parasitemia. Mice with disrupted recombinase-activating genes (RAG/KO) that lack B and T cells provided a model for determining the importance of innate immunity to resistance. RAG/KO and WT mice had similar parasitemia levels until Day 13 of infection, suggestive of effective control of parasitism by the innate immune system during the early phase of infection; from then on parasitemia was higher in RAG/KO. Double RAG/IL-10 KO mice and RAG/KO mice had superimposable parasitemia curves, indicating that in the absence of T and B cells, endogenous IL-10 does not limit the efficacy of the innate immune system. Treatment of infected RAG/KO, IL-10/KO, and WT mice with anti-IFN-γ, anti-TNF, or anti-IL-12 neutralizing mAbs increased parasitemia levels showing the importance of endogenous production of these cytokines in the control of parasitism by innate and specific immune responses. Spleen cells from anti-IL12-treated WT mice had diminished production of IFN-γ and NO, suggesting that early IFN-γ synthesis is most dependent on IL-12 stimulation.",

    "abstract": "T cell antigen receptor (TCR) diversity is a critical feature of adaptive immunity. However, restriction of TCR diversity is a potential risk during immune reconstitution by homeostatic proliferation. What peripheral mechanisms are in place to maintain TCR diversity during recovery from lymphopenia? Here, we examine competition between several monoclonal CD4 T cell populations in RAG−/− and TCR Tg RAG−/− environments. The results suggest that specific self ligands constitute a critical limiting resource essential for homeostatic proliferation of naive CD4 T cells. In addition, T cells ignore large numbers of competitors as long as their TCR specificity is different and other non-MHC resources are not limiting. Therefore, the numbers of self ligands expressed in the periphery set the limits on TCR diversity.",

    "title": "Comparison of the Virulence Potential of Acinetobacter Strains from Clinical and Environmental Sources",
    "abstract": "Several Acinetobacter strains have utility for biotechnology applications, yet some are opportunistic pathogens. We compared strains of seven Acinetobacter species (baumannii, Ab; calcoaceticus, Ac; guillouiae, Ag; haemolyticus, Ah; lwoffii, Al; junii, Aj; and venetianus, Av-RAG-1) for their potential virulence attributes, including proliferation in mammalian cell conditions, haemolytic/cytolytic activity, ability to elicit inflammatory signals, and antibiotic susceptibility. Only Ah grew at 102 and 104 bacteria/well in mammalian cell culture medium at 37°C. However, co-culture with colonic epithelial cells (HT29) improved growth of all bacterial strains, except Av-RAG-1. Cytotoxicity of Ab and Ah toward HT29 was at least double that of other test bacteria. These effects included bacterial adherence, loss of metabolism, substrate detachment, and cytolysis. Only Ab and Ah exhibited resistance to killing by macrophage-like J774A.1 cells. Haemolytic activity of Ah and Av-RAG-1 was strong, but undetectable for other strains. When killed with an antibiotic, Ab, Ah, Aj and Av-RAG-1 induced 3 to 9-fold elevated HT29 interleukin (IL)-8 levels. However, none of the strains altered levels of J774A.1 pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6 and tumor necrosis factor-α). Antibiotic susceptibility profiling showed that Ab, Ag and Aj were viable at low concentrations of some antibiotics. All strains were positive for virulence factor genes ompA and epsA, and negative for mutations in gyrA and parC genes that convey fluoroquinolone resistance. The data demonstrate that Av-RAG-1, Ag and Al lack some potentially harmful characteristics compared to other Acinetobacter strains tested, but the biotechnology candidate Av-RAG-1 should be scrutinized further prior to widespread use.",

We also performed adoptive transfer of dnTGF-betaRII CD8(+) splenocytes, with or without B cells, to 8-week-old female Rag-1(-/-) mice to assess the role of B cells in the inflammatory response.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe B cell-deficient Igmu(-/-)dnTGF-betaRII mice unexpectedly developed a more severe form of cholangitis than controls (dnTGF-betaRII mice) and had a significantly greater frequency of activated CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells in the liver. They also had reduced frequency of Foxp3(+) regulatory T cells in the hepatic CD4(+) T-cell population and natural killer (NK) T cells (NK1.1(+) CD3(+)) in hepatic inflammatory cell infiltrates. The Igmu(-/-)dnTGF-betaRII mice had increased levels of proinflammatory cytokines (tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-6) and developed a more severe form of colitis than controls. Adoptive transfer of CD8(+) splenocytes from dnTGF-betaRII mice and peritoneal cavity-derived, but not spleen-derived, CD19(+) B cells into Rag-1(-/-) mice resulted in decreased amounts of liver inflammation and bile duct damage, compared with Rag-1(-/-) mice in which only CD8(+) splenocytes were transferred.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nB cells have a suppressive effect on the inflammatory response in the dnTGF-betaRII model of primary biliary cirrhosis.",

    "abstract": "IL-27 limits CD4+ TH17 cell development in vitro and during inflammatory responses in the CNS. However, whether IL-27-IL-27R interactions regulate the homeostasis or function of CD4+ T cell populations in the intestine is unknown. To test this, we examined CD4+ T cell populations in the intestine of wild-type and IL-27R−/− mice. Naive IL-27R−/− mice exhibited a selective decrease in the frequency of IFN-γ producing CD4+ TH1 cells and an increase in the frequency of TH17 cells in gut-associated lymphoid tissues. Associated with elevated expression of IL-17A, IL-27R−/− mice exhibited earlier onset and significantly increased severity of clinical disease compared with wild-type controls in a murine model of intestinal inflammation. Rag−/−/IL-27R−/− mice were also more susceptible than Rag−/− mice to development of dextran sodium sulfate-induced intestinal inflammation, indicating an additional role for IL-27-IL-27R in the regulation of innate immune cell function. Consistent with this, IL-27 inhibited proinflammatory cytokine production by activated neutrophils. Collectively, these data identify a role for IL-27-IL-27R interaction in controlling the homeostasis of the intestinal T cell pool and in limiting intestinal inflammation through regulation of innate and adaptive immune cell function.",

    "title": "Extrathymic T Cell Lymphopoiesis: Ontogeny and Contribution to Gut Intraepithelial Lymphocytes in Athymic and Euthymic Mice",
    "abstract": "In the absence of thymopoiesis, T lymphocytes are nevertheless present, mainly in the gut epithelium. Ontogeny of the extrathymic pathway and the extent of its involvement in euthymic mice are controversial. These questions have been addressed by assessing the expression of recombinase activating gene (RAG) through the use of green fluorescent protein RAG2 transgenic mouse models. In athymic mice, T lymphopoiesis occurs mainly in the mesenteric lymph node and less in the Peyer’s patches. Ontogenic steps of this lymphopoiesis resemble those of thymopoiesis, but with an apparent bias toward (cid:2)(cid:3) T cell production and with a paucity of oligoclonal (cid:4)(cid:5) T cells possibly resulting from a deficit in positive selection. Whether in athymic or euthymic mice, neither T intraepithelial lymphocytes (IEL) nor cryptopatch cells (reported to contain precursors of IEL) displayed fluorescence indicating recent RAG protein synthesis. Newly made T cells migrate from the mesenteric node into the thoracic duct lymph to reach the gut mucosa. In euthymic mice, this extrathymic pathway is totally repressed, except in conditions of severe lymphocytic depletion. Thus, in normal animals, all gut T IEL, including CD8 (cid:4)(cid:4) (cid:6) cells, are of thymic origin, CD8 (cid:4)(cid:4) (cid:6) TCR (cid:4)(cid:5) (cid:6) IEL being the likely progeny of double negative NK1-1 (cid:7) thymocytes, which show polyclonal V (cid:4) and V (cid:5) repertoires.",

    "title": "Increased Prevalence of Regulatory T Cells (Treg) is Induced by Pancreas Adenocarcinoma",
    "abstract": "We reported earlier that patients with breast or pancreas cancer have an increased prevalence of regulatory T cells (Treg) in the blood and tumor draining lymph nodes (TDLNs) compared with healthy individuals. In the current study, we tested the hypothesis that tumor cells promote the prevalence of Treg. The transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) secreting murine pancreas adenocarcinoma, Pan02 cell line was injected into syngeneic C57BL/6 mice and the prevalence of Treg in the TDLNs and tumor spleen was measured weekly. Compared with control mice, the prevalence of CD25+CD4+ cells in TDLNs and in tumor spleen increased with tumor growth. Analysis of these CD25+CD4+ T cells in vitro confirmed expression of the Treg marker, Foxp3. In addition, their functional activity resembled that of Treg, as evidenced by a poor proliferative capacity; suppression of proliferation of CD25−CD4 or CD8T cells and inhibition of interferon-γ release by CD25−CD4+ T cells. Reconstitution of Pan02-bearing Rag−/− mice with naive syngeneic CD25−CD4+ T cells induced CD25+CD4+Foxp3+ T cells in TDLNs, but not in the spleen. In contrast, Foxp3 was not detected in unreconstituted Pan02-bearing Rag−/− mice, or reconstituted mice bearing a TGF-β–negative esophageal tumor. Furthermore, administration of neutralizing anti–TGF-β antibody blocked the induction of Foxp3 in reconstituted Pan02-bearing Rag−/− mice. These results mimic earlier in vitro studies showing induction of Foxp3 through CD3 plus CD28 stimulation in the presence of TGF-β. We conclude that Pan02 tumor promotes the prevalence of Treg, in part through the secretion of TGF-β, which may result in immune evasion.",

    "abstract": "Dysregulated T cell responses to enteric bacteria have been implicated as a common mechanism underlying pathogenesis in rodent models of colitis. However, the bacterial species and T cell specificities that induce disease have been poorly defined. We have developed a model system in which target antigen, bacterial host, and corresponding T cell specificity are defined. OVA-specific T cells from DO11.RAG-2−/− TCR transgenic mice were transferred into RAG-2−/− recipients whose intestinal tracts were colonized with OVA-expressing or control Escherichia coli. Transfer of antigen-naive DO11.RAG-2−/− T cells into recipients colonized with OVA-E. coli resulted in enhanced intestinal recruitment and cell cycling of OVA-specific T cells; however, there was no development of disease. In contrast, transfer of polarized T helper (Th) 1 and Th2 populations resulted in severe wasting and colitis in recipients colonized with OVA-expressing but not control E. coli. The histopathologic features of disease induced by Th1 and Th2 transfers were distinct, but disease severity was comparable. Induction of disease by both Th1 and Th2 transfers was dependent on bacterially associated OVA. These results establish that a single bacterially associated antigen can drive the progression of colitis mediated by both Th1 and Th2 cells and provide a new model for understanding the immunoregulatory interactions between T cells responsive to gut floral antigens.",

    "abstract": "We have investigated the origin of intraepithelial lymphocytes (IEL) populations in the murine gut, using reconstitution experiments in which the presence of thymus-derived cells of host or donor origin is rigorously controlled: RAG-/- mutant mice which have no T cells, were injected either with the bone marrow (BM) cells of nude mice or with selected peripheral lymph node (LN) T cells of euthymic mice. In thymectomized RAG-/- mice, injection of BM cells from nude mice led, after 2 mo, to the development of a peripheral B cell compartment and to the appearance, in the gut, of IEL bearing homodimeric CD8 alpha chains and either gamma/delta or alpha/beta TCR. In RAG-/- mice with a thymus, a similar injection led to complete lymphoid reconstitution, with the additional appearance in the gut of CD4+, CD8 alpha/beta+ or CD4+CD8 alpha/alpha+ IEL, all bearing alpha/beta TCR. In contrast, injection of LN T cells into these mice reconstituted a gut IEL population made of CD4+, CD8 alpha/beta+, or CD4+ CD8 alpha/alpha+ cells, all bearing alpha/beta TCR; CD8 alpha/alpha+ TCR-gamma/delta+ or alpha/beta+ IEL were not observed. These results demonstrate that the thymus and/or thymic-derived peripheral T cells are absolutely required for the generation of CD4+, CD8 alpha/beta+, and CD4+CD8 alpha/alpha+ IEL, which are thus thymus dependent. In contrast, TCR+ CD8 alpha/alpha+ IEL appear in the absence of the thymus, and thus are thymus independent.",

Of 16 agents tested, only interleukin-7 (IL-7) induced V(D)J gene rearrangement and sustained expression of the RAG-1 and RAG-2 genes, which are known to control rearrangement.

    "title": "Microvascular density in predicting survival of patients with choroidal and ciliary body melanoma.",
    "abstract": "PURPOSE\nAlthough malignant uveal melanoma disseminates predominantly hematogenously because of the absence of intraocular lymphatics, consensus about prognostic impact of microvascular density (MVD) has not been reached. This study was undertaken to investigate whether MVD, microvascular patterns, or both determine prognosis of uveal melanoma.\n\n\nMETHODS\nA population-based retrospective cohort study of melanoma-specific and all-cause mortality of 167 consecutive patients who had an eye enucleated because of choroidal or ciliary body melanoma from 1972 through 1981 was conducted. MVD was determined by counting tumor vessels in a masked fashion from areas of highest vessel density after immunostaining for CD34 epitope, factor VIII-related antigen (FVIII-RAg), and alpha-smooth muscle actin (SMA). Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression analyses of survival were performed. The association between MVD and tumor size and location, cell type, and microvascular patterns was assessed.\n\n\nRESULTS\nMVD could be determined from 134 of 167 melanomas (80%). Based on globally highest count obtained with antibodies to CD34, MVD ranged from 5 to 121 vessels/0.313 mm2 (median, 40) and its association with presence of microvascular loops and networks (P = 0.0006), epithelioid cells (P = 0.028), and largest basal tumor diameter (P = 0.0029) was statistically significant. The 10-year melanoma-specific mortality increased with MVD (0.09, 0.29, 0.59, and 0.64, according to quartiles; P < 0.0001), as did all-cause mortality (P = 0.0022). Equivalent results were obtained with immunostaining for FVIII-RAg, whereas MVD obtained with antibodies to SMA was not associated with prognosis. Cox regression showed a hazard ratio of 2.45 (95% CI, 1.43-4.18) for presence of epithelioid cells, 1.11 (95% CI, 1.03-1.20) for largest basal diameter, 1.23 (95% CI, 1.06-1.43) for square root-transformed MVD, and 1.51 (95% CI, 1.09-2.10) for presence of loops and networks, all of which independently contributed to prognosis.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe findings support the theory that both MVD and microvascular patterns contribute independently to prognosis in uveal melanoma in addition to cell type and size of the tumor.",

    "title": "Interleukin 12–dependent Interferon ␥ Production by Cd8 ␣ Ϩ Lymphoid Dendritic Cells",
    "abstract": "We investigated the role of antigen-presenting cells in early interferon (IFN)-␥ production in normal and recombinase activating gene 2–deficient (Rag-2 ϪրϪ) mice in response to Listeria monocytogenes (LM) infection and interleukin (IL)-12 administration. Levels of serum IFN-␥ in Rag-2 ϪրϪ mice were comparable to those of normal mice upon either LM infection or IL-12 injection. Depletion of natural killer (NK) cells by administration of anti-asialoGM1 antibodies had little effect on IFN-␥ levels in the sera of Rag-2 ϪրϪ mice after LM infection or IL-12 injection. Incubation of splenocytes from NK cell–depleted Rag-2 ϪրϪ mice with LM resulted in the production of IFN-␥ that was completely blocked by addition of anti–IL-12 antibodies. Both dendritic cells (DCs) and monocytes purified from splenocytes were capable of producing IFN-␥ when cultured in the presence of IL-12. Intracellular immunofluorescence analysis confirmed the IFN-␥ production from DCs. It was further shown that IFN-␥ was produced predominantly by CD8 ␣ ϩ lymphoid DCs rather than CD8 ␣ Ϫ myeloid DCs. Collectively, our data indicated that DCs are potent in producing IFN-␥ in response to IL-12 produced by bacterial infection and play an important role in innate immunity and subsequent T helper cell type 1 development in vivo. Key words: recombinase-activating gene 2 knockout mouse • nonobese diabetic-severe combined immunodeficiency disease mouse • ␥ c knockout mouse • natural killer cells • Listeria monocytogenes D endritic cells (DCs) are bone marrow (BM)-derived professional APCs. Peripheral DCs are characterized by high capability for antigen capture and processing, migration to lymphoid organs, and expression of various costimulatory molecules for antigen-specific lymphocyte activation. Cyto-kine secretion by DCs initiates and enhances both innate and acquired immunity (1). Activation of macrophages and DCs by infectious agents leads to secretion of IL-12, which subsequently induces IFN-␥ production by NK cells and directs Th1 development. IFN-␥ , in turn, acts on monocytes to augment IL-12 secretion and to produce nitric oxide that eradicates infected microbes (2, 3). Thus, IL-12 and IFN-␥ comprise a positive feedback system, which is probably required for optimal production of IL-12 in vivo (4, 5). Studies using neutralizing Abs against IFN-␥ and mice deficient for IL-12 or IFN-␥ have confirmed the importance of these cytokines for innate immunity and Th1 development for controlling intracellu-lar pathogens (6–11). It was generally assumed that the only cells producing IFN-␥ in response to IL-12 are NK and T cells. However, recent studies have shown that …",

    "abstract": "Rag enzymes are the main players in V(D)J recombination, the process responsible for rearrangement of TCR and Ig genes. Hypomorphic Rag mutations in humans, which maintain partial V(D)J activity, cause a peculiar SCID associated with autoimmune-like manifestations, Omenn syndrome (OS). Although a deficient ability to sustain thymopoiesis and to produce a diverse T and B cell repertoire explains the increased susceptibility to severe infections, the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying the spectrum of clinical and immunological features of OS remain poorly defined. In order to better define the molecular and cellular pathophysiology of OS, we generated a knockin murine model carrying the Rag2 R229Q mutation previously described in several patients with OS and leaky forms of SCID. These Rag2(R229Q/R229Q) mice showed oligoclonal T cells, absence of circulating B cells, and peripheral eosinophilia. In addition, activated T cells infiltrated gut and skin, causing diarrhea, alopecia, and, in some cases, severe erythrodermia. These findings were associated with reduced thymic expression of Aire and markedly reduced numbers of naturally occurring Tregs and NKT lymphocytes. In conclusion, Rag2(R229Q/R229Q) mice mimicked most symptoms of human OS; our findings support the notion that impaired immune tolerance and defective immune regulation are involved in the pathophysiology of OS.",

    "title": "Immune Cells Contribute to Myelin Degeneration and Axonopathic Changes in Mice Overexpressing Proteolipid Protein in Oligodendrocytes",
    "abstract": "Overexpression of the major myelin protein of the CNS, proteolipid protein (PLP), leads to late-onset degeneration of myelin and pathological changes in axons. Based on the observation that in white matter tracts of these mutants both CD8+ T-lymphocytes and CD11b+ macrophage-like cells are numerically elevated, we tested the hypothesis that these cells are pathologically involved in the primarily genetically caused neuropathy. Using flow cytometry of mutant brains, CD8+ cells could be identified as activated effector cells, and confocal microscopy revealed a close association of the T-cells with MHC-I+ (major histocompatibility complex class I positive) oligodendrocytes. Crossbreeding the myelin mutants with mice deficient in the recombination activating gene-1 (RAG-1) lacking mature T- and B-lymphocytes led to a reduction of the number of CD11b+ cells and to a substantial alleviation of pathological changes. In accordance with these findings, magnetic resonance imaging revealed less ventricular enlargement in the double mutants, partially because of more preserved corpora callosa. To investigate the role of CD8+ versus CD4+ T-lymphocytes, we reconstituted the myelin-RAG-1 double mutants with bone marrow from either CD8-negative (CD4+) or CD4-negative (CD8+) mice. The severe ventricular enlargement was only found when the double mutants were reconstituted with bone marrow from CD8+ mice, suggesting that the CD8+ lymphocytes play a critical role in the immune-related component of myelin degeneration in the mutants. These findings provide strong evidence that a primary glial damage can cause secondary immune reactions of pathological significance as it has been suggested for some forms of multiple sclerosis and other leukodystrophies.",

    "title": "Basal B Cell Receptor-Directed Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinase Signaling Turns Off RAGs and Promotes B Cell-Positive Selection1",
    "abstract": "PI3K plays key roles in cell growth, differentiation, and survival by generating the second messenger phosphatidylinositol-(3,4,5)-trisphosphate (PIP3). PIP3 activates numerous enzymes, in part by recruiting them from the cytosol to the plasma membrane. We find that in immature B lymphocytes carrying a nonautoreactive Ag receptor, PI3K signaling suppresses RAG expression and promotes developmental progression. Inhibitors of PI3K signaling abrogate this positive selection. Furthermore, immature primary B cells from mice lacking the p85α regulatory subunit of PI3K suppress poorly RAG expression, undergo an exaggerated receptor editing response, and, as in BCR-ligated cells, fail to progress into the G1 phase of cell cycle. Moreover, immature B cells carrying an innocuous receptor have sustained elevation of PIP3 levels and activation of the downstream effectors phospholipase C (PLC)γ2, Akt, and Bruton’s tyrosine kinase. Of these, PLCγ2 appears to play the most significant role in down-regulating RAG expression. It therefore appears that when the BCR of an immature B cell is ligated, PIP3 levels are reduced, PLCγ2 activation is diminished, and receptor editing is promoted by sustained RAG expression. Taken together, our results provide evidence that PI3K signaling is an important cue required for fostering development of B cells carrying a useful BCR.",

    "abstract": "Productive rearrangement of the T‐cell receptor (TCR) β gene and signalling through the pre‐TCR–CD3 complex are required for survival, proliferation and differentiation of T‐cell progenitors (pro‐T cells). Here we identify a role for death receptor signalling in early T‐cell development using a dominant‐negative mutant of the death receptor signal transducer FADD/MORT1 (FADD‐DN). In rag‐1−/− thymocytes, which are defective in antigen receptor gene rearrangement, FADD‐DN bypassed the requirement for pre‐TCR signalling, promoting pro‐T‐cell survival and differentiation to the more mature pre‐T stage. Surprisingly, differentiation was not accompanied by the proliferation that occurs normally during transition to the pre‐T stage. Consistent with a role for FADD/MORT1 in this cell division, FADD‐DN rag‐1−/− pro‐T cells failed to proliferate in response to CD3ϵ ligation. Concomitant signalling through the pre‐TCR and death receptors appears to trigger pro‐T cell survival, proliferation and differentiation, whereas death receptor signalling in thymocytes that lack a pre‐TCR induces apoptosis. Later in life all FADD‐DN rag‐1−/− mice developed thymic lymphoma, indicating that FADD/MORT1 can act as a tumour suppressor.",

    "title": "The LMP2A ITAM Is Essential for Providing B Cells with Development and Survival Signals In Vivo",
    "abstract": "ABSTRACT In Epstein-Barr virus-transformed B cells, known as lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs), LMP2A binds the tyrosine kinases Syk and Lyn, blocking B-cell receptor (BCR) signaling and viral lytic replication. SH2 domains in Syk mediate binding to a phosphorylated immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM) in LMP2A. Mutation of the LMP2A ITAM in LCLs eliminates Syk binding and allows for full BCR signaling, thereby delineating the significance of the LMP2A-Syk interaction. In transgenic mice, LMP2A causes a developmental alteration characterized by a block in surface immunoglobulin rearrangement resulting in BCR-negative B cells. Normally B cells lacking cognate BCR are rapidly apoptosed; however, LMP2A transgenic B cells develop and survive without a BCR. When bred into the recombinase activating gene 1 null (RAG−/−) background, all LMP2A transgenic lines produce BCR-negative B cells that develop and survive in the periphery. These data indicate that LMP2A imparts developmental and survival signals to B cells in vivo. In this study, LMP2A ITAM mutant transgenic mice were generated to investigate whether the LMP2A ITAM is essential for the survival phenotype in vivo. LMP2A ITAM mutant B cells develop normally, although transgene expression is comparable to that in previously described nonmutated LMP2A transgenic B cells. Additionally, LMP2A ITAM mutant mice are unable to promote B-cell development or survival when bred into the RAG−/− background or when grown in methylcellulose containing interleukin-7. These data demonstrate that the LMP2A ITAM is required for LMP2A-mediated developmental and survival signals in vivo.",

    "title": "Adoptive transfer of CD8+ T cells from transforming growth factor beta receptor type II (dominant negative form) induces autoimmune cholangitis in mice",
    "abstract": "We recently reported that mice with a T cell–restricted expression of a dominant negative form of transforming growth factor β receptor type II (dnTGFβRII) spontaneously develop autoimmune cholangitis that resembles human primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC), including antimitochondrial antibodies (AMAs) and extensive portal CD4+ and CD8+ lymphocytic infiltrates. On the basis of these data, we performed a series of experiments to determine whether the pathology was secondary to direct dnTGFβRII disruption of the liver and/or alternatively the appearance of autoreactive T cells. First, using dnTGFβRIIRag1−/− mice, we noted a normal hepatic and biliary structure. Hence, we performed a rigorous series of adoptive transfer studies, transferring Ly5.1+ unfractionated spleen cell CD4+ or CD8+ T cells from dnTGFβRII mice into B6/Rag−/− (Ly 5.2) recipients. In unmanipulated dnTGFβRII mice, there was a marked increase in CD4+ and CD8+ T cell biliary infiltrates with AMA. Indeed, B6/Rag−/− recipients of dnTGFβRII unfractionated cells develop features of liver disease similar to PBC, suggesting that splenic loss of self‐tolerance alone is sufficient to cause disease in this model and therefore that there is no specific abnormality in the biliary targets required for appearance of disease. More importantly, adoptive transfer of CD8+ but not CD4+ T cells into B6/Rag−/− mice led to liver histopathology remarkably similar to PBC, emphasizing a prominent role for CD8 T cell–mediated pathogenesis. In contrast, B6/Rag−/− recipients of CD4+ T cells from dnTGFβRII mice predominantly developed inflammatory bowel disease associated with higher levels of serum interferon γ and tumor necrosis factor α. Conclusion: These data suggest that in this model of PBC, autoreactive CD8+ cells destroy bile ducts. (HEPATOLOGY 2008.)",

    "title": "The phylogenetic origins of the antigen‐binding receptors and somatic diversification mechanisms",
    "abstract": "Summary:  The adaptive immune system arose in ancestors of the jawed vertebrates approximately 500 million years ago. Homologs of immunoglobulins (Igs), T‐cell antigen receptors (TCRs), major histocompatibility complex I (MHC I) and MHC II, and the recombination‐activating genes (RAGs) have been identified in all extant classes of jawed vertebrates; however, no definitive homolog of any of these genes has been identified in jawless vertebrates or invertebrates. RAG‐mediated recombination and associated junctional diversification of both Ig and TCR genes occurs in all jawed vertebrates. In the case of Igs, somatic variation is expanded further through class switching, gene conversion, and somatic hypermutation. Although the identity of the ‘primordial’ receptor that was interrupted by the recombination mechanism in jawed vertebrates may never be established, many different families of genes that exhibit predicted characteristics of such a receptor have been described both within and outside the jawed vertebrates. Recent data from various model systems point toward a continuum of immune receptor diversity, encompassing many different families of recognition molecules whose functions are integrated in an organism's response to pathogenic invasion. Various approaches, including both genomic and protein‐functional analyses, currently are being applied in jawless vertebrates, protochordates, and other invertebrate deuterostome systems and may yield definitive evidence regarding the presence or absence of adaptive immune homologs in species lacking adaptive immune systems. Such studies have the potential for uncovering previously unknown mechanisms of generating receptor diversity.",

    "abstract": "Mature T cells may be produced in the thymus, or by expansion in the periphery. While thymus output of virgin cells ensures repertoire diversity, peripheral expansion increases the size of rare clones, and thus the efficiency of immune responses. We studied the role of both phenomena in the generation of the CD8+ T cell pool using RAG−/− female mice expressing a transgenic T cell receptor specific for the male antigen; nude mice injected with peripheral T cells; and euthymic irradiated chimeras injected with bone marrow and mature T cells. Our results show that the total number of virgin and activated T cells, each constituting about half of the peripheral T cell pool, was regulated by homeostatic mechanisms controlling pool size. The size of each pool was regulated independently, revealing an efficient mechanism to maintain repertoire diversity while optimizing the immune response.",

    "abstract": "A monoclonal antibody directed against the von Willebrand factor moiety (vWF) of factor VIII-von Willebrand factor (FVIII-vWF), which blocks ristocetin-induced platelet aggregation as well as the binding of FVIII-vWF to platelets in the presence of ristocetin, inhibited platelet adherence to human artery subendothelium when present in normal flowing blood. This monoclonal antibody, CLB-RAg 35, inhibited platelet adherence as a function of the shear rate. At wall shear rates below 500 s-1, platelet adherence was not affected, but at higher shear rates platelet adherence was gradually inhibited, reaching an average of 11% of the normal value at 2,500 s-1. Indirect immunofluorescence established the reactivity of CLB-RAg 35 with vWF present in artery subendothelium. Pretreatment of normal vessel walls with this antibody inhibited adherence of platelets in blood from a patient with severe homozygous von Willebrand's disease and in blood from normal individuals. The inhibition was shear-rate dependent and significant at high shear rates (2,500 s-1). By adding increasing amounts of purified FVIII-vWF to normal blood, the inhibition was gradually overcome. These data indicate that vWF present in the vessel wall contributes appreciably to platelet adherence. At high wall shear rates, platelet adherence is mediated virtually completely by both plasma FVIII-vWF and vWF in the vessel wall. At low wall shear rates (below 500 s-1), platelet adherence occurs independent of FVIII-vWF in plasma and vWF in the vessel wall.",

    "abstract": "The structure and physicochemical properties of microbial surfaces at the molecular level determine their adhesion to surfaces and interfaces. Here, we report the use of atomic force microscopy (AFM) to explore the morphology of soft, living cells in aqueous buffer, to map bacterial surface heterogeneities, and to directly correlate the results in the AFM force-distance curves to the macroscopic properties of the microbial surfaces. The surfaces of two bacterial species, Acinetobacter venetianus RAG-1 and Rhodococcus erythropolis 20S-E1-c, showing different macroscopic surface hydrophobicity were probed with chemically functionalized AFM tips, terminating in hydrophobic and hydrophilic groups. All force measurements were obtained in contact mode and made on a location of the bacterium selected from the alternating current mode image. AFM imaging revealed morphological details of the microbial-surface ultrastructures with about 20 nm resolution. The heterogeneous surface morphology was directly correlated with differences in adhesion forces as revealed by retraction force curves and also with the presence of external structures, either pili or capsules, as confirmed by transmission electron microscopy. The AFM force curves for both bacterial species showed differences in the interactions of extracellular structures with hydrophilic and hydrophobic tips. A. venetianus RAG-1 showed an irregular pattern with multiple adhesion peaks suggesting the presence of biopolymers with different lengths on its surface. R. erythropolis 20S-E1-c exhibited long-range attraction forces and single rupture events suggesting a more hydrophobic and smoother surface. The adhesion force measurements indicated a patchy surface distribution of interaction forces for both bacterial species, with the highest forces grouped at one pole of the cell for R. erythropolis 20S-E1-c and a random distribution of adhesion forces in the case of A. venetianus RAG-1. The magnitude of the adhesion forces was proportional to the three-phase contact angle between hexadecane and water on the bacterial surfaces.",

    "abstract": "Previous studies have shown that the chronic inflammation observed in the colon of IL-10-deficient (IL-10(-/-)) mice is mediated by CD4+ Th1 T cells and is dependent on the presence of IFN-gamma for its initial development. As CD4+ T cells from IL-10(-/-) mice will cause colitis when transferred into recombinase-activating gene (Rag)-deficient recipients, we considered the possibility that the recipients' NK cells could be an important source of IFN-gamma for the development of colitis. Therefore, the ability of IL-10(-/-) CD4+ T cells to cause colitis in Rag-deficient recipients that had been depleted of NK cells was tested. Contrary to our expectations, NK cell-depleted recipients of IL-10(-/-) CD4+ T cells developed accelerated disease compared with nondepleted recipients. Furthermore, CD4+ T cells from normal mice (IL-10(+/+)) also caused colitis in NK cell-depleted recipient mice, but not in nondepleted recipients. NK cells inhibited effector CD4+CD45RBhigh T cells, and subsequent experiments showed that this effect was dependent on perforin. Thus NK cells can play an important role in down-regulating Thl-mediated colitis by controlling the responses of effector T cells to gut bacteria.",

    "abstract": "Following transfer into lymphopenic hosts, naive CD8 T cells proliferate and acquire memory phenotype. Although the acquired phenotype is stable in recombination activating gene-1-deficient (RAG−/−) recipients, in sublethally irradiated mice naive CD8 T cells of donor origin gradually accumulate. The naive cells have been attributed to phenotypic reversion of homeostatic memory cells, implying instability of memory phenotype and restoration of the naive T cell compartment by homeostasis-driven proliferation. We show here that (i) the accumulation of naive CD8 T cells of donor origin only occurs in recipients that have been irradiated and have an intact thymus; (ii) the apparent reversion of memory to naive cells actually results from de novo T cell development of hematopoietic stem cells, present in the donor spleen or lymph node cell populations, in the thymus of irradiated recipients; and (iii) the number of homeostatic memory cells generated in both RAG−/− and irradiated hosts reaches a plateau value and their phenotype is stably maintained even after retransfer into nonirradiated normal mice for 30 days. These findings demonstrate that homeostatic memory T cells do not revert to naive cells. After severe T cell depletion homeostasis-driven proliferation restores only the memory T cell compartment, whereas thymopoiesis is required for the reconstitution of the naive T cell compartment.",

    "abstract": "We describe a novel approach to assay the ability of particular gene products to signal transitions in lymphocyte differentiation in vivo. The method involves transfection of test expression constructs into RAG-1-deficient embryonic stem cells, which are subsequently assayed by the RAG-2-deficient blastocyst complementation approach. We have used this method to demonstrate that expression of activated Ras in CD4-8- (double negative, DN) prothymocytes in vivo induces their differentiation into small CD4+8+ (double positive, DP) cortical thymocytes with accompanying expansion to normal thymocyte numbers. However, activated Ras expression in DP cells does not cause proliferation or maturation to CD4+8- or CD4-8+ (single positive) thymocytes. Therefore, signaling through Ras is sufficient for promoting differentiation of DN to DP cells, but further differentiation requires the activity of additional signaling pathways.",

    "abstract": "IL-7R-deficient mice have severely impaired expansion of early lymphocytes and lack γδ T cells. To elucidate the role of IL-7R on γδ T cell development, we analyzed the rearrangements of TCR-α, β, γ, and δ genes in the thymus of the IL-7R-deficient mice. Southern blot analysis with a Jγ1 probe revealed that more than 70% of Jγ1 and Jγ2 alleles are recombined to form distinct Vγ1.2–Jγ2 and Vγ2–Jγ1 fragments in control mice. On the contrary, no such recombination was detected in the mutant mice. The rearrangements in the TCR-α, β, and δ loci were comparably observed in control and mutant mice. PCR analysis indicated that the V–J recombination of all the Vγ genes is severely hampered in the mutant mice. The mRNA of RAG-1, RAG-2, Ku-80, and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) genes was equally detected between control and mutant thymi, suggesting that the expression of common recombination machinery is not affected. These data demonstrated that the V–J recombination of the TCR γ genes is specifically blocked in the IL-7R-deficient mice and suggested the presence of highly specific regulation for TCR γ gene rearrangement.",

    "title": "An active v-abl protein tyrosine kinase blocks immunoglobulin light-chain gene rearrangement.",
    "abstract": "Lymphoid cells transformed by Abelson murine leukemia virus have provided one of the classic models for study of early B-cell development and immunoglobulin rearrangement. Most of these cells have rearranged their heavy-chain locus but not their light chain genes, suggesting that an active v-abl protein interferes with this differentiation step. To test this hypothesis, light-chain gene structure was examined in pre-B cells transformed by temperature-sensitive mutants of the Abelson virus and in derivatives that survive at the nonpermissive temperature because they express a human BCL-2 gene. Our studies reveal that inactivation of the v-abl protein tyrosine kinase triggers high-frequency rearrangement of kappa and lambda light-chain genes. These events are accompanied by marked increases in the expression of RAG-1 and RAG-2 RNAs. These increases occur in the absence of protein synthesis but are dependent on inactivation of the v-abl protein tyrosine kinase. As documented in the accompanying paper (Klug et al., this issue), an active v-abl protein also suppresses the activity of NF-kappa B/rel and expression controlled by the kappa intron enhancer. Together these data demonstrate that the v-abl protein specifically interferes with light-chain gene rearrangement by suppressing at least two pathways essential for this stage of B-cell differentiation and suggest that tyrosine phosphorylation is important in regulating RAG gene expression.",

    "abstract": "Recombinant-activating gene 2 (RAG-2−/−) T cell receptor–transgenic mice repeatedly injected with the superantigen staphylococcal enterotoxin A entered a tolerant state in which splenic CD4+ T cells produced little interleukin (IL)-2, interferon γ, or IL-4. This state resulted from a combination of both clonal anergy and cytokine-mediated immunosuppression. The anergy persisted for at least 3 wk and could be distinguished from the suppression by a decrease in IL-2 production per cell, a block in the activation of early response kinases, and a failure to be reversed with anti–transforming growth factor (TGF)-β. Full suppression lasted for only 1 wk and involved both IL-10 and TGF-β, but required additional unknown molecules for optimal effect. These experiments show that complex in vivo interactions of multiple peripheral tolerance mechanisms can now be dissected at both the cellular and molecular levels.",

    "abstract": "By using mice genomically lacking IFN-γR, IL-12, perforin, and recombination-activating gene-1 (RAG-1), we analyzed the regulation and importance of IFN-γ in the control of infection with Chlamydia pneumoniae. IL-12 participates in resistance of mice to C. pneumoniae, probably by regulating the protective levels of IFN-γ mRNA. In turn, IFN-γ is necessary for the increased IL-12p40 mRNA accumulation that occurs in lungs during infection with C. pneumoniae, suggesting a positive feedback regulation between these two cytokines. In experiments including RAG-1−/−/IFN-γR−/− mice we showed that IFN-γ produced by innate cells controls the bacterial load and is necessary for the increased accumulation of transcripts for enzymes controlling high output NO release (inducible NO synthase), superoxide production (gp-91 NADPH oxidase), and catalyzis of tryptophan (indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO)), mechanisms probably related to bacterial killing. Adaptive immune reponses diminish the levels of IFN-γ and IL-12 mRNA and thereby the levels of inducible NO synthase, IDO, and gp91 NADPH oxidase trancripts. By using RAG-1−/−/perforin−/− mice, we excluded the overt participation of NK cell cytotoxicity in the control of C. pneumoniae. However, NK cells and probably other innate immune cells release IFN-γ during the bacterial infection.",

In lymphangioma, pyogenic granuloma, and pigmented purpuric dermatosis, positivity was either patchy or of lesser intensity. Numerous strongly positive endothelial cells lining well-formed blood vessels were present in lesions of Kaposi's sarcoma, but the proliferating spindle cells forming \"vascular slits\" were uniformly negative. The cells of angiosarcoma were essentially negative, except for isolated elements in the better-differentiated areas. Plasma was also strongly positive; this may aid in distinguishing vascular from lymphatic channels.

    "abstract": "Background: Among the various classes of processed starchy foods, wheat-based cereal products exhibit a wide range in glycemic and insulinemic responses. Understanding starch behavior during cooking and processing may help identify strategies that lower postprandial glycemia and insulinemia. Objective: To determine the relationship between the in vivo glycemic index (GI)/insulinemic index (II) and in vitro digestibility and composition characteristics (rapidly available glucose and slowly available glucose, RAG and SAG respectively) of 24 plain sweet biscuits (cookies). Methods: The products were commercially available and selected on the basis of their high starch content. In vivo responses (GI and II) were measured by standardised methods over 7 studies, with 12 subjects in each study (30 males, 42 females). In vitro digestibility characteristics were measured by the Englyst procedure. Results: The observed GI ranged from 38 to 60 (low to moderate) with the majority between 40 and 50, and correlated strongly with the observed insulinemic index (r = 0.76, P < 0.0001). The digestibility profile of carbohydrates was significantly correlated to in vivo responses (SAG and GI: r = −0.41; p = 0.04; SAG and II: r = −0.52; p < 0.01; RAG and GI: r = 0.5; p = 0.01; RAG and II: r = 0.34; p = 0.1) and explained in vivo responses better than fat, protein and fiber content amongst this selection of plain sweet biscuits. Conclusion: The findings indicate that plain sweet biscuits have a low GI and a moderate II and that these characteristics are correlated to in vitro starch digestibility and are dependent on the type of processing.",

RAG-1(-/-) mice were not protected from acute renal failure induced by 27.5 min of bilateral renal ischemia and subsequent reperfusion [serum urea nitrogen levels 30 h after reperfusion, 155.2 +/- 5.6 and 152.8 +/- 11.4 mg/dl in RAG-1(-/-) and wild-type mice, respectively; n = 13 each]. Histological examination showed acute tubular necrosis and neutrophilic infiltration with no significant differences between groups. In contrast with other organ systems, Igs were not found in kidneys at time points ranging from 1 min to 30 h after ischemia. Thus Igs and mature T lymphocytes do not appear to play a significant role in the pathogenesis of IRI in the kidney.",

Defects in this process result in profound immunodeficiency as is the case in the C.B-17 SCID mouse or in RAG-1 (recombination-activating gene 1) or RAG-2 deficient mice. It has recently become clear that the V(D)J recombinase most likely consists of both lymphoid-specific factors and ubiquitously expressed components of the DNA double-strand break repair pathway. The deficit in SCID mice is in a factor that is required for both of these pathways. In this report, we show that the factor defective in the autosomal recessive severe combined immunodeficiency of Arabian foals is required for (i) V(D)J recombination, (ii) resistance to ionizing radiation, and (iii) DNA-dependent protein kinase activity.",

    "abstract": "To investigate host and viral mechanisms determining hepadnaviral persistence and hepatocarcinogenesis, we developed a mouse model by transplanting woodchuck hepatocytes into the liver of mice that contain the urokinase-type plasminogen activator transgene (uPA) and lack mature B and T lymphocytes due to a recombination activation gene 2 (RAG-2) gene knockout. The woodchuck hepatocytes were transplanted via intrasplenic injection and were found to integrate into the recipient mouse liver cord structure. Normal adult woodchuck hepatocytes proliferated and reconstituted up to 90% of the uPA/RAG-2 mouse liver. uPA/RAG-2 mice containing woodchuck hepatocytes were infectable with woodchuck hepatitis virus (WHV) and showed WHV replication for at least 10 months with titers up to 1 x 10(11) virions per ml in the peripheral blood. WHV-infected hepatocytes from chronic carrier woodchucks also established a persistent infection in uPA/RAG-2 mice after an 8- to 12-week lag period of viremia. Although WHV envelope, core, and X proteins were produced in the uPA/RAG-2 mice, no inflammatory host immune response was observed in the liver of WHV-replicating mice. A first antiviral test demonstrated a greater than four orders of magnitude drop in WHV titer in response to interferon alpha treatment. WHV replication was up-regulated by dexamethasone treatment. Comparison of precancerous lesions in donor woodchucks versus recipient uPA/RAG-2 mice revealed an enrichment of dysplastic precancerous hepatocytes in transplanted mice. Clonal amplification of hepatocytes from a woodchuck with hepatocellular carcinomas was demonstrated by the detection of unique WHV DNA integration patterns in hepatocellular carcinomas that arose in uPA/RAG-2 mice. In the absence of B or T cell-mediated immune responses, WHV establishes a persistent noncytotoxic infection of woodchuck hepatocytes in uPA/RAG-2 chimeric mouse livers. Further studies of the kinetics of hepadnavirus infection and replication in quiescent and proliferating hepatocytes should increase our understanding of hepadnavirus spread and aid in the design of therapies to block or cure persistent infection.",

    "title": "Requirement of Shp-2 tyrosine phosphatase in lymphoid and hematopoietic cell development.",
    "abstract": "Shp-1 and Shp-2 are cytoplasmic phosphotyrosine phosphatases with similar structures. Mice deficient in Shp-2 die at midgestation with defects in mesodermal patterning, and a hypomorphic mutation at the Shp-1 locus results in the moth-eaten viable (me(v)) phenotype. Previously, a critical role of Shp-2 in mediating erythroid/myeloid cell development was demonstrated. By using the RAG-2-deficient blastocyst complementation, the role of Shp-2 in lymphopoiesis has been determined. Chimeric mice generated by injecting Shp-2(-/-) embryonic stem cells into Rag-2-deficient blastocysts had no detectable mature T and B cells, serum immunoglobulin M, or even Thy-1(+) and B220(+) precursor lymphocytes. Collectively, these results suggest a positive role of Shp-2 in the development of all blood cell lineages, in contrast to the negative effect of Shp-1 in this process. To determine whether Shp-1 and Shp-2 interact in hematopoiesis, Shp-2(-/-):me(v)/me(v) double-mutant embryos were generated and the hematopoietic cell development in the yolk sacs was examined. More hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells were detected in Shp-2(-/-):me(v)/me(v) embryos than in Shp-2(-/-) littermates. The partial rescue by Shp-1 deficiency of the defective hematopoiesis caused by the Shp-2 mutation suggests that Shp-1 and Shp-2 have antagonistic effects in hematopoiesis, possibly through a bidirectional modulation of the same signaling pathway(s).",

This process involves the breakage and reunion of DNA mediated by two lymphoid cell‐specific proteins, recombination activating genes RAG‐1 and RAG‐2, and ubiquitously expressed architectural DNA‐binding proteins and DNA‐repair factors. Here I review the progress toward understanding the composition, assembly, organization, and activity of the protein‐DNA complexes that support the initiation of V(D)J recombination, as well as the molecular basis for the sequence‐specific recognition of recombination signal sequences (RSSs) that are the targets of the RAG proteins. Parallels are drawn between V(D)J recombination and Tn5/Tn10 transposition with respect to the reactions, the proteins, and the protein‐DNA complexes involved in these processes. I also consider the relative roles of the different sequence elements within the RSS in recognition, cleavage, and post‐cleavage events. Finally, I discuss alternative DNA transactions mediated by the V(D)J recombinase, the protein‐DNA complexes that support them, and factors and forces that control them.",

    "abstract": "The topographic relationships between anterior thalamic neurons and their terminal projection fields in the retrosplenial cortex of the rat were characterized by experiments with the fluorescent dye retrograde labeling technique. The results demonstrate that the anterodorsal (DAD) and anteroventral (AV) nuclei project heavily to retrosplenial granular cortex (Rg) and to a lesser extent to retrospenial agranular cortex (Rag). In contrast, the anteromedial (AM) and lateral dorsal (LD) nuclei project heavily to Rag and more lightly to Rg. Irrespective of terminal field in Rg or Rag, the neuronal cell bodies in AD and AV are organized topographically so that the neurons in the caudal part of each nucleus project to rostral retrosplenial cortex and the neurons in the rostral portion of each nucleus project to the caudal retrosplenial cortex. Further, the ventromedial AD and AV neurons project to rostral retrosplenial cortex, whereas dorsolateral neurons in both nuclei project to caudal retrosplenial cortex. LD neurons display a different topographic organization. The neurons in the medioventral part of LD project primarily to the rostral retrosplenial cortex, and the neurons in lateral LD project to the caudal retrosplenial cortex. This latter projection to the caudal retrosplenial cortex is also contributed to by neurons residing in the mediodorsal part of caudal LD. The neurons in AM that project to the retrosplenial cortex display less segregation than the AV, AD, or LD neurons. In all experiments, a number of neurons in the dorsal ventro‐anterolateral nucleus were labeled by retrosplenial injections. The largest number of cells in this nucleus were labeled after Rag injections, and these were topographically organized such that the neurons projecting to the rostral Rag were located immediately deep to the internal medullary lamina, and the neurons projecting to the caudal Rag were more ventrally located. Very few thalamic neurons have axon collaterals to different areas of the retrosplenial cortex as shown by double labeling experiments. Together, these results demonstrate a highly organized thalamic projection to the retrosplenial cortex.",

    "abstract": "RAGs (recombination activating genes) are responsible for the generation of antigen receptor diversity through the process of combinatorial joining of different V (variable), D (diversity) and J (joining) gene segments. In addition to its physiological property, wherein RAG functions as a sequence‐specific nuclease, it can also act as a structure‐specific nuclease leading to genomic instability and cancer. In the present study, we investigate the factors that regulate RAG cleavage on non‐B DNA structures. We find that RAG binding and cleavage on heteroduplex DNA is dependent on the length of the double‐stranded flanking region. Besides, the immediate flanking double‐stranded region regulates RAG activity in a sequence‐dependent manner. Interestingly, the cleavage efficiency of RAGs at the heteroduplex region is influenced by the phasing of DNA. Thus, our results suggest that sequence, length and phase positions of the DNA can affect the efficiency of RAG cleavage when it acts as a structure‐specific nuclease. These findings provide novel insights on the regulation of the pathological functions of RAGs.",

    "abstract": "CTLA-4-deficient mice develop a fatal lymphoproliferative disorder, characterized by polyclonal expansion of peripheral lymphocytes. To examine the effect of restricting the CD4(+) TCR repertoire on the phenotype of CTLA-4-deficient mice and to assess the influence of CTLA-4 on peptide-specific CD4(+) T cell responses in vitro, an MHC class II-restricted T cell receptor (AND TCR) transgene was introduced into the CTLA-4(-/-) animals. The expression of the AND TCR transgene by CD4(+) T cells delays but does not prevent the lymphoproliferation in the CTLA-4(-/-) mice. The CD4(+) T cells become preferentially activated and expand. Interestingly, young AND TCR(+) CTLA-4(-/-) mice carrying a null mutation in the rag-1 gene remain healthy and the T cells maintain a naive phenotype until later in life. We demonstrate that CTLA-4 regulates the peptide-specific proliferative response generated by naive and previously activated AND TCR(+) RAG(-/-) T cells in vitro. The absence of CTLA-4 also augments the responder frequency of cytokine-secreting AND TCR(+) RAG(-/-) T cells. These results demonstrate that CTLA-4 is a key regulator of peptide-specific CD4(+) T cell responses and support the model that CTLA-4 plays a differential role in maintaining T cell homeostasis of CD4(+) vs. CD8(+) T cells.",

    "abstract": "The development of plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDC2) from human CD34(+) stem cells in vivo was studied in RAG-2(-/-) interleukin (IL)-2Rgamma(-/-) mice that lack functional T and B cells and natural killer cells. CD34(+) cells isolated from fetal liver or thymus were labeled with 5- and 6-carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester (CFSE) and were injected into a human thymus grafted subcutaneously in the RAG-2(-/-) IL-2Rgamma(-/-) mice. One to 4 weeks later the CFSE label was found not only in T cells but also in CD123(+/high) CD4(+)CD45RA(+) pDC2, indicating that the CD34(+) cells can develop into pDC2 within a thymus. In addition to pDC2, CFSE-labeled dendritic cells with a mature phenotype, determined by the cell surface markers CD11c, CD83, and CD80, were found in the injected human thymus graft. pDC2 was not found in the periphery of mice carrying a human thymic graft, indicating that the intrathymic pDC2 failed to emigrate from the thymus. We also demonstrate that pDC2 can develop outside the thymus because relatively high percentages of pDC2 were found in the periphery after the intravenous injection of CD34(+)CD38(-) fetal liver cells in RAG-2(-/-) IL-2Rgamma(-/-) mice without a human thymus graft. These data indicate that the thymus and the peripheral pDC2 develop independently of each other.",

    "abstract": "The analysis of the expression of the alpha chain of the IL-2 receptor (CD25, TAC) on the surface of B lineage cells in mouse bone marrow reveals that it is a useful marker to distinguish pre-B-I from pre-B-II cells. CD25 is not expressed on CD45R(B220)+ c-kit+ CD43+ TdT+ lambda 5+ c mu- sIg-IgH chain locus DJH-rearranged pre-B-I cells of mouse bone marrow. It is expressed on large cycling CD45R(B220)+ c-kit- CD43+ TdT- lambda 5+ c mu+ sIg- and on small resting CD45R(B220)+ c-kit- CD43- TdT- lambda 5- c mu- sIg- IgH chain locus VHDJH-rearranged pre-B-II cells. Therefore, the transition from pre-B-I to large pre-B-II cells is marked by the downregulation of c-kit and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT), and by the upregulation of CD25. SCID, RAG-2T, microMT and lambda 5T mutant mice do have normal, if not elevated numbers of pre-B-I cells but lack all CD25+ pre-B-II cells in their bone marrow. The expression of a transgenic H chain under control of the microH chain enhancer in RAG-2T bone marrow B lineage precursors allows the development of large and small CD25+ pre-B-II cells. The results suggest that the differentiation of pre-B-I to pre-B-II cells in mouse bone marrow requires the expression of microH chains and surrogate L chains in membranes, probably on the surface of precursor B cells.",

    "title": "Two Mesoarchaean terranes in the Reguibat shield of NW Mauritania",
    "abstract": "Abstract Two domains have previously been recognized in the Archaean Reguibat shield of NW Mauritania, based primarily on their gross lithological differences. New fieldwork has identified a major ductile shear zone (Tâçarât–Inemmaûdene Shear Zone) separating these domains and new geochronological studies show that the two domains record different Mesoarchaean histories. As such, the two domains are redefined as the Choum–Rag el Abiod Terrane and Tasiast–Tijirit Terrane. Previous isotopic studies of metamorphic lithologies of the eastern Choum–Rag el Abiod Terrane indicate a succession of crustal growth from about 3.5–3.45 Ga to between about 3.2 and 2.99 Ga. Isotopic data presented in this contribution from the Tasiast–Tijirit Terrane indicate that emplacement of major calc-alkaline plutons occurred at c. 2.93 Ga after volcanism (preserved as greenstone belts) that included late felsic eruptive centres dated at c. 2965 Ma. This Mesoarchaean intrusive and extrusive magmatism was confined to the Tasiast–Tijirit Terrane, where it was emplaced through migmatitic orthogneisses that are the oldest lithodemic unit of the Tasiast–Tijirit Terrane. Widespread bimodal, post-tectonic magmatism in both terranes included major granitic magmatism dated at c. 2730 Ma. The north–south- to NNE–SSW-trending curvilinear Tâçarât–Inemmaûdene Shear Zone that separates the two terranes records late intense transpressive ductile shearing. It has a flower structure over a horizontal distance of about 70 km across its southern portion with unquantifiable sinistral horizontal offset, and east-directed thrusting on its eastern side where it cuts into the Choum–Rag el Abiod Terrane. A new U–Pb zircon age of 2954±111 Ma is presented for a deformed granite confined within the central part of this shear zone. A minimum age for the shearing is provided by a previously determined c. 2.73 Ga age for a post-tectonic granite that cuts across the easternmost part of the shear zone in the Choum–Rag el Abiod Terrane.",

    "abstract": "Tumor cells are typically poorly immunogenic. The same mechanisms that evolved to avoid the induction of immune responses against self tissues, and, hence, autoimmune disease, also have to be overcome for immune therapy of cancer. Toll-like receptor-activating microbial products such as CpG motif containing DNA are among the primary stimuli that the immune system uses to distinguish between infectious nonself (that is to be attacked) and noninfectious self (that must not be attacked). We tested in a murine RMA lymphoma/C57BL/6 model whether providing the infectious nonself context in a tumor–by injecting CpG-oligodeoxynucleotides directly into the tumor–would elicit a protective antitumor response. Complete remission of established solid tumors was achieved in immune competent mice, but not in T cell/B cell-deficient RAG-1 knockout mice. Intratumor injection of CpG-oligodeoxynucleotides was shown to induce a tumor-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cell response of the type 1 effector class, and T cells adoptively transferred the protection to RAG-1 knockout mice. The data show that intratumor injection of CpG-oligodeoxynucleotides is a promising strategy for rendering tumors immunogenic.",

    "title": "A Gene Network Perspective on Axonal Regeneration",
    "abstract": "The regenerative capacity of injured neurons in the central nervous system is limited due to the absence of a robust neuron-intrinsic injury-induced gene response that supports axon regeneration. In peripheral neurons axotomy induces a large cohort of regeneration-associated genes (RAGs). The forced expression of some of these RAGs in injured neurons has some beneficial effect on axon regeneration, but the reported effects are rather small. Transcription factors (TFs) provide a promising class of RAGs. TFs are hubs in the regeneration-associated gene network, and potentially control the coordinate expression of many RAGs simultaneously. Here we discuss the use of combined experimental and computational methods to identify novel regeneration-associated TFs with a key role in initiating and maintaining the RAG-response in injured neurons. We propose that a relatively small number of hub TFs with multiple functional connections in the RAG network might provide attractive new targets for gene-based and/or pharmacological approaches to promote axon regeneration in the central nervous system.",

    "abstract": "Interferon-producing killer dendritic cells (IKDCs) have only recently been described and they share some properties with plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs). We now show that they can arise from some of the same progenitors. However, IKDCs expressed little or no RAG-1, Spi-B, or TLR9, but responded to the TLR9 agonist CpG ODN by production of IFNgamma. The RAG-1(-)pDC2 subset was more similar to IKDCs than RAG-1(+) pDC1s with respect to IFNgamma production. The Id-2 transcriptional inhibitor was essential for production of IKDCs and natural killer (NK) cells, but not pDCs. IKDCs developed from lymphoid progenitors in culture but, unlike pDCs, were not affected by Notch receptor ligation. While IKDCs could be made from estrogen-sensitive progenitors, they may have a slow turnover because their numbers did not rapidly decline in hormone-treated mice. Four categories of progenitors were compared for IKDC-producing ability in transplantation assays. Of these, Lin(-)Sca-1(+)c-Kit(Hi)Thy1.1(-)L-selectin(+) lymphoid progenitors (LSPs) were the best source. While NK cells resemble IKDCs in several respects, they develop from different progenitors. These observations suggest that IKDCs may arise from a unique differentiation pathway, and one that diverges early from those responsible for NK cells, pDCs, and T and B cells.",

    "abstract": "Background: The mechanism of fragility at mcr during t(14;18) translocation is not known. Results: RAGs nick mcr using a unique mechanism involving the CCACCTCT motif, which is critical for its fragility. Importantly, mcr undergoes synapsis with RSS within cells, which is RAG-dependent. Conclusion: RAGs are responsible for fragility at mcr. Significance: The mechanism identified herein may help in understanding how DNA breaks during other translocations. The t(14;18) translocation in follicular lymphoma is one of the most common chromosomal translocations. Breaks in chromosome 18 are localized at the 3′-UTR of BCL2 gene or downstream and are mainly clustered in either the major breakpoint region or the minor breakpoint cluster region (mcr). The recombination activating gene (RAG) complex induces breaks at IgH locus of chromosome 14, whereas the mechanism of fragility at BCL2 mcr remains unclear. Here, for the first time, we show that RAGs can nick mcr; however, the mechanism is unique. Three independent nicks of equal efficiency are generated, when both Mg2+ and Mn2+ are present, unlike a single nick during V(D)J recombination. Further, we demonstrate that RAG binding and nicking at the mcr are independent of nonamer, whereas a CCACCTCT motif plays a critical role in its fragility, as shown by sequential mutagenesis. More importantly, we recapitulate the BCL2 mcr translocation and find that mcr can undergo synapsis with a standard recombination signal sequence within the cells, in a RAG-dependent manner. Further, mutation to the CCACCTCT motif abolishes recombination within the cells, indicating its vital role. Hence, our data suggest a novel, physiologically relevant, nonamer-independent mechanism of RAG nicking at mcr, which may be important for generation of chromosomal translocations in humans.",

    "title": "Immature surface Ig+ B cells can continue to rearrange kappa and lambda L chain gene loci",
    "abstract": "Pro and pre B cells possess the long-term capacity to proliferate in vitro on stromal cells and interleukin 7 (IL-7) and can differentiate to surface immunoglobulin (sIg+) cells upon removal of IL-7 from the cultures. A key event in this differentiation is the extensive cell loss due to apoptosis. Because the proto-oncogene bcl-2 can promote cell survival, we established pre-B cell lines from E mu-bcl-2 transgenic mice. These pre-B cells have the same properties as those derived from non-bcl-2 transgenic mice except that they do not die by apoptosis. This allowed us to study the fate of newly formed B cells in vitro for a longer period of time. Here we show that early during the differentiation of pre-B cells, upregulation of RAG-1 and RAG-2 expression go hand in hand with rearrangements of the Ig gene loci. Moreover, the newly formed sIg+ B cells continue to express RAG-1 and RAG-2 and continue to rearrange L chain gene loci, even in the absence of proliferation, in an orderly fashion, so that kappa L+ sIg+ cells can become lambda L+ sIg+ or sIg- cells, whereas lambda L+ sIg+ cells can become sIg-, but not kappa L+ sIg+ cells. Thus, deposition of a complete Ig molecule on the surface of a B cell does not automatically stop the Ig-rearrangement machinery.",

This ability is conferred by the recombination activating genes I and II (RAG I and RAG II).

Homology domains identified within shark RAG I prompted sequence comparison analyses that suggested similarity of the RAG I and II genes, respectively, to the integrase family genes and integration host factor genes of the bacterial site-specific recombination system.

    "abstract": "B and T cells have been implicated in the pathogenesis of renal ischemia reperfusion injury (IRI); however, it is unknown if B and T cells interact in early injury responses, as seen in adaptive immune responses. Recent evidence has shown that B‐cell deficient and T‐cell deficient mice are partially protected from renal IRI. Renal IRI was induced in recombinase activating gene (RAG)‐1 deficient mice, which lack both B and T cells. RAG‐1 deficient mice from two different background strains were not protected from renal IRI. Adoptive transfer of either B or T cells into RAG‐1 deficient mice led to a significant protection of renal injury, which was independent of effects on neutrophil trafficking. Neutrophil depletion in RAG‐1 deficient mice did not protect from IRI. While deficiency of either B or T cells reduced IRI, combined lack of both is not protective. These results demonstrate that complex interactions between B and T cells are likely occurring in kidney IRI.",

    "abstract": "The recombination-activating gene (RAG)-1 and RAG-2 are expressed specifically in immature lymphoid cells undergoing the recombination of Ag receptor genes. We studied the regulation of murine RAG-2 promoter and revealed that −41/−17 RAG-2 promoter region, which was indispensable for the RAG-2 promoter activity in B cell lines, contained binding sites for lymphoid enhancer-binding factor-1 (LEF-1), c-Myb, and Pax-5. We showed that these three transcription factors bound the promoter region in vitro and in vivo. Cotransfection assays using a human embryonic kidney cell line (293T) showed that LEF-1, c-Myb, and Pax-5 cooperatively activated the RAG-2 promoter, via their synergistic DNA binding. We also showed that LEF-1, c-Myb, and Pax-5 physically interact in the cells. Finally, we demonstrated that a dominant-negative LEF-1 protein, which lacks the binding site for β-catenin, suppressed the RAG-2 promoter activity as well as the endogenous RAG-2 expression in a pre-B cell line (18.81). These results suggest that LEF-1/β-catenin complex regulates the RAG-2 promoter activation in concert with c-Myb and Pax-5 in immature B cells. The link between LEF-1/β-catenin and Wnt signaling in B lineage cells will be discussed.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT The adhesion of a recently described species, Acinetobacter venetianus VE-C3 (F. Di Cello, M. Pepi, F. Baldi, and R. Fani, Res. Microbiol. 148:237–249, 1997), to diesel fuel (a mixture of C12 to C28n-alkanes) andn-hexadecane was studied and compared to that ofAcinetobacter sp. strain RAG-1, which is known to excrete the emulsifying lipopolysaccharide, emulsan. Oxygen consumption rates, biomass, cell hydrophobicity, electrophoretic mobility, and zeta potential were measured for the two strains. The dropping-mercury electrode (DME) was used as an in situ adhesion sensor. In seawater, RAG-1 was hydrophobic, with an electrophoretic mobility (μ) of −0.38 × 10−8 m2V−1 s−1 and zeta potential (ζ) of −4.9 mV, while VE-C3 was hydrophilic, with μ of −0.81 × 10−8 m2 V−1 s−1 and ζ of −10.5 mV. The microbial adhesion to hydrocarbon (MATH) test showed that RAG-1 was always hydrophobic whereas the hydrophilic VE-C3 strain became hydrophobic only after exposure to n-alkanes. Adhesion of VE-C3 cells to diesel fuel was partly due to the production of capsular polysaccharides (CPS), which were stained with the lectin concanavalin A (ConA) conjugated to fluorescein isothiocyanate and observed in situ by confocal microscopy. The emulsan from RAG-1, which was negative to ConA, was stained with Nile Red fluorochrome instead. Confocal microscope observations at different times showed that VE-C3 underwent two types of adhesion: (i) cell-to-cell interactions, preceding the cell adhesion to the n-alkane, and (ii) incorporation of nanodroplets of n-alkane into the hydrophilic CPS to form a more hydrophobic polysaccharide–n-alkane matrix surrounding the cell wall. The incorporation of n-alkanes as nanodroplets into the CPS of VE-C3 cells might ensure the partitioning of the bulk apolar phase between the aqueous medium and the outer cell membrane and thus sustain a continuous growth rate over a prolonged period.",

    "title": "Human Cytomegalovirus Infection Maintains mTOR Activity and Its Perinuclear Localization during Amino Acid Deprivation",
    "abstract": "ABSTRACT The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) kinase is present in 2 functionally distinct complexes, mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) and complex 2 (mTORC2). Active mTORC1 mediates phosphorylation of eIF4E-binding protein (4E-BP) and p70 S6 kinase (S6K), which is important for maintaining translation. During human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infection, cellular stress responses are activated that normally inhibit mTORC1; however, previous data show that HCMV infection circumvents stress responses and maintains mTOR kinase activity. Amino acid deprivation is a stress response that normally inhibits mTORC1 activity. Amino acids can signal to mTORC1 through the Rag proteins, which promote the colocalization of mTORC1 with its activator Rheb-GTP in a perinuclear region, thereby inducing 4E-BP and S6K phosphorylation. As expected, our results show that amino acid depletion in mock-infected cells caused loss of mTORC1 activity and loss of the perinuclear localization; however, there was no loss of activity or perinuclear localization in HCMV-infected cells where the perinuclear localization of Rheb-GTP and mTOR coincided with the perinuclear assembly compartment (AC). This suggested that HCMV infection bypasses normal Rag-dependent amino acid signaling. This was demonstrated by short hairpin RNA (shRNA) depletion of Rag proteins, which had little effect on mTORC1 activity in infected cells but inhibited activity in mock-infected cells. Our data show that HCMV maintains mTORC1 activity in an amino acid- and Rag-independent manner through the colocalization of mTOR and Rheb-GTP, which occurs in association with the formation of the AC, thus bypassing inhibition that may result from lowered amino acid levels.",

    "title": "Definition of regulatory network elements for T cell development by perturbation analysis with PU.1 and GATA-3.",
    "abstract": "PU.1 and GATA-3 are transcription factors that are required for development of T cell progenitors from the earliest stages. Neither one is a simple positive regulator for T lineage specification, however. When expressed at elevated levels at early stages of T cell development, each of these transcription factors blocks T cell development within a different, characteristic time window, with GATA-3 overexpression initially inhibiting at an earlier stage than PU.1. These perturbations are each associated with a distinct spectrum of changes in the regulation of genes needed for T cell development. Both transcription factors can interfere with expression of the Rag-1 and Rag-2 recombinases, while GATA-3 notably blocks PU.1 and IL-7Ralpha expression, and PU.1 reduces expression of HES-1 and c-Myb. A first-draft assembly of the regulatory targets of these two factors is presented as a provisional gene network. The target genes identified here provide insight into the basis of the effects of GATA-3 or PU.1 overexpression and into the regulatory changes that distinguish the developmental time windows for these effects.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND & AIMS\nT helper (Th) 17 cells that express the retinoid-related orphan receptor (ROR) γt contribute to the development of colitis in mice, yet are found in normal and inflamed intestine. We investigated their development and functions in intestines of mice.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe analyzed intestinal Th17 cells in healthy and inflamed intestinal tissues of mice. We analyzed expression of lymphotoxin (LT)α by Th17 cells and lymphoid tissue inducer-like cells.\n\n\nRESULTS\nLTα(-/-) and RORγt(-/-) mice had significantly lower percentages of naturally occurring Th17 cells in the small intestine than wild-type mice. Numbers of CD3(-)CD4(+/-)interleukin-7Rα(+)c-kit(+)CCR6(+)NKp46(-) lymphoid tissue inducer-like cells that produce interleukin-17A were increased in LTα(-/-) and LTα(-/-) × recombination activating gene (RAG)-2(-/-) mice, compared with wild-type mice, but were absent from RORγt(-/-) mice. Parabiosis of wild-type and LTα(-/-) mice and bone marrow transplant experiments revealed that LTα-dependent gut-associated lymphoid tissue structures are required for generation of naturally occurring Th17 cells. However, when wild-type or LTα(-/-) CD4(+)CD45RB(high) T cells were transferred to RAG-2(-/-) or LTα(-/-)×RAG-2(-/-) mice, all groups, irrespective of the presence or absence of LTα on the donor or recipient cells, developed colitis and generated Th1, Th17, and Th17/Th1 cells. RAG-2(-/-) mice that received a second round of transplantation, with colitogenic but not naturally occurring Th17 cells, developed intestinal inflammation. The presence of naturally occurring Th17 cells in the colons of mice inhibited development of colitis after transfer of CD4(+)CD45RB(high) T cells and increased the numbers of Foxp3(+) cells derived from CD4(+)CD45RB(high) T cells.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nGut-associated lymphoid tissue structures are required to generate naturally occurring Th17 cells that have regulatory activities in normal intestines of mice, but not for colitogenic Th17 and Th17/Th1 cells during inflammation.",

    "abstract": "Although severe combined immune deficiency (SCID) is a very important research model for mice and SCID mice are widely used, there are only few reports describing the SCID pig models. Therefore, additional research in this area is needed. In this study, we describe the generation of Recombination activating gene-1 (Rag-1)-deficient neonatal piglets in Duroc breed using somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) with gene targeting and analysis using fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) and histology. We constructed porcine Rag-1 gene targeting vectors for the Exon 2 region and obtained heterozygous/homozygous Rag-1 knockout cell colonies using SCNT. We generated two Rag-1-deficient neonatal piglets and compared them with wild-type neonatal piglets. FACS analysis showed that Rag-1 disruption causes a lack of Immunoglobulin M-positive B cells and CD3-positive T cells in peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Consistent with FACS analysis, histological analysis revealed structural defects and an absence of mature lymphocytes in the spleen, mesenteric lymph node (MLNs), and thymus in Rag-1-deficient piglets. These results confirm that Rag-1 is necessary for the generation of lymphocytes in pigs, and Rag-1-deficient piglets exhibit a T and B cell deficient SCID (T-B-SCID) phenotype similar to that of rodents and humans. The T-B-SCID pigs with Rag-1 deficiency generated in this study could be a suitably versatile model for laboratory, translational, and biomedical research, including the development of a humanized model and assessment of pluripotent stem cells.",

    "title": "Natural Occurring IL-17 Producing T Cells Regulate the Initial Phase of Neutrophil Mediated Airway Responses1",
    "abstract": "Effector Th17 cells are a major source of IL-17, a critical inflammatory cytokine in autoimmune diseases and in host defenses during bacterial infections. Recently, splenic lymphoid tissue inducer-like cells have been reported to be a source of T cell independent IL-17. In this study, we report that the immune system contains a unique set of natural occurring IL-17 producing cell, “natural” Th17 (nTh17), which are a memory-like T cell subset. The nTh17 cells can develop in the absence of the IL-6/STAT3 signaling axis required by inducible Th17 cells. The nTh17 cell population is distinct from conventional inducible Th17 cells, since nTh17 cells express substantial amounts of IL-17A (IL-17), but not IL-17F, under the control of the master regulator, RORγt. The nTh17 cells simultaneously produce IFN-γ. DO11.10 transgenic mice with a Rag−/− background (DO11.10 Rag−/−) lack nTh17 cells, and, following intranasal administration of OVA, IL-17-dependent neutrophil infiltration occurs in DO11.10 transgenic mice, but not in DO11.10 Rag−/− mice. The impaired neutrophil-dependent airway response is restored by adaptive transfer of nTh17 cells into DO11.10 Rag−/− mice. These results demonstrate that a novel T cell subset, nTh17, facilitates the early phase of Ag-induced airway responses and host defenses against pathogen invasion before the establishment of acquired immunity.",

    "abstract": "Bullous pemphigoid (BP), the most common autoimmune blistering disease, is caused by autoantibodies against type XVII collagen (COL17). To establish an active stable BP animal model that demonstrates the persistent inflammatory skin lesions initiated by the anti-human COL17 Abs, we used COL17-humanized (COL17m−/−,h+) mice that we recently produced. First, we generated immunodeficient Rag-2−/−/COL17–humanized mice by crossing Rag-2−/− mice with COL17-humanized mice. Then, splenocytes from wild-type mice that had been immunized by grafting of human COL17-transgenic mouse skin were transferred into Rag-2−/−/COL17–humanized mice. The recipient mice continuously produced anti-human COL17 IgG Abs in vivo and developed blisters and erosions corresponding to clinical, histological, and immunopathological features of BP, although eosinophil infiltration, one of the characteristic histological findings observed in BP patients, was not detected in the recipients. Although the depletion of CD8+ T cells from the immunized splenocytes was found to produce no effects in the recipients, the depletion of CD4+ T cells as well as CD45R+ B cells was found to inhibit the production of anti-human COL17 IgG Abs in the recipients, resulting in no apparent clinical phenotype. Furthermore, we demonstrated that cyclosporin A significantly suppressed the production of anti-human COL17 IgG Abs and prevented the development of the BP phenotype in the treated recipients. Although this model in an immunodeficient mouse does not exactly reproduce the induction mechanism of BP in human patients, this unique experimental system targeting humanized pathogenic Ag allows us to investigate ongoing autoimmune responses to human molecules in experimental animal models.",

    "abstract": "By using a T, B, or NK cell-deficient mouse strain (recombinase-activating gene (RAG)-1−/−/common cytokine receptor γ-chain (γCR)), and T and B cell and IFN-γ-deficient (RAG-1−/−/IFN-γ−/−) mice, we have studied the generation of immunity against infection by Chlamydia pneumoniae. We found that IFN-γ secreted by innate-cell populations protect against C. pneumoniae infection. However, NK cells were not needed for such IFN-γ-dependent innate immune protection. Inoculation of wild type, but not IFN-γ−/− bone marrow-derived macrophages protected RAG-1−/−/IFN-γ−/− mice against C. pneumoniae infection. In line, pulmonary macrophages from RAG-1−/− C. pneumoniae-infected mice expressed IFN-γ mRNA. Reconstitution of RAG-1−/−/γcR−/− or RAG-1−/−/IFN-γ−/− mice with CD4+ or CD8+ cells by i.v. transfer of FACS sorted wild type spleen cells (SC) increased resistance to C. pneumoniae infection. On the contrary, no protection was observed upon transfer of IFN-γ−/− CD4+ or IFN-γ−/− CD8+ SC. T cell-dependent protection against C. pneumoniae was weaker when IFN-γR−/− CD4+ or IFN-γR−/− CD8+ SC were inoculated into RAG-1−/−/IFN-γ−/− mice. Thus both nonlymphoid and T cell-derived IFN-γ can play a central and complementary role in protection against C. pneumoniae. IFN-γ secreted by nonlymphoid cells was not required for T cell-mediated protection against C. pneumoniae; however, IFN-γ regulated T cell protective functions.",

    "abstract": "The orphan nuclear receptor, retinoid acid-related orphan receptor (ROR)α, is essential for the development of cerebellar Purkinje cells and bone tissue. RORα may also play a critical role in lymphocyte development and function because staggerer mice, a natural mutant strain with a disrupted expression of RORα, have reduced thymic and splenic cellularity. In this report, we analyzed the role of RORα in lymphocyte development by examining lymphoid compartments in RORα−/− mice and Rag-2−/− mice reconstituted with RORα−/− bone marrow. We found that T and B cell development was severely defective in RORα−/− mice, but not in Rag-2−/−/RORα−/− chimeric mice. We also analyzed cellular and humoral immune responses in Rag-2−/−/RORα−/− chimeric mice. Our results show that serum IgG levels were elevated in Rag-2−/−/RORα−/− chimeric mice after immunization with a T-dependent Ag compared with control chimeras. IFN-γ production by RORα−/− CD8+ T cells after TCR stimulation was also increased. Furthermore, RORα−/− mast cells and macrophages produced an increased amount of TNF-α and IL-6 upon activation. These results indicate that RORα indirectly regulates lymphocyte development by providing an appropriate microenvironment and controls immune responses by negatively regulating cytokine production in innate immune cells and lymphocytes.",

    "title": "Microbial degradation of crude oil: factors affecting the dispersion in sea water by mixed and pure cultures.",
    "abstract": "By means of the enrichment culture technique, a mixed population of microorganisms was obtained which catalyzed the dispersion of crude oil in supplemented sea water. From this enrichment culture, eight pure cultures were isolated and studied. Only one of the isolates (RAG-1) brought about a significant dispersion of crude oil. RAG-1 has been tentatively characterized as a member of the genus Arthrobacter. The other seven isolates gave rise to colonies on supplemented oil agar, but were neither able to disperse oil nor to stimulate the dispersion catalyzed by RAG-1. The dispersion of crude oil by either RAG-1 or the enrichment culture was absolutely dependent on exogenous sources of nitrogen and phosphorous and completely inhibited by 10(-2)m azide. The increase in cell number of RAG-1 was directly proportional to the concentration of crude oil added to the medium over the range 0.05 to 1.0 mg/ml. Within this linear region, 1.0 mg of crude oil yielded 9 x 10(7) cells and approximately 65% of the oil was converted into a nonbenzene extractable form. Accompanying the emulsification was a decrease in the pH from 7.6 to 5.0. Acidic conditions, however, were neither necessary nor sufficient for oil dispersion. When sea water was supplemented with 0.029 mm K(2)HPO(4) and 3.8 mm (NH(4))(2)SO(4) and inoculated with RAG-1, oil dispersion occurred within 1 day. This dispersion could also be brought about by the supernatant following separation of the cells from the medium. Similarly, the supernatant obtained following growth of RAG-1 on hexadecane was capable of emulsifying crude oil in 60 min.",

    "abstract": "Gut intraepithelial CD8 T lymphocytes (T-IEL) are distinct from thymus-derived cells and are thought to derive locally from cryptopatch (CP) precursors. The intermediate stages of differentiation between CP and mature T-IEL were not identified, and the local differentiation process was not characterized. We identified and characterized six phenotypically distinct lineage-negative populations in the CP and the gut epithelium: (a) we determined the kinetics of their generation from bone marrow precursors; (b) we quantified CD3-ε, recombination activating gene (Rag)-1, and pre-Tα mRNAs expression at single cell level; (c) we characterized TCR-β, -γ, and -α locus rearrangements; and (d) we studied the impact of different mutations on the local differentiation. These data allowed us to establish a sequence of T cell precursor differentiation in the gut. We also observed that the gut differentiation varied from that of the thymus by a very low frequency of pre-Tα chain mRNA expression, a different kinetics of Rag-1 mRNA expression, and a much higher impact of CD3 ε/δ and pre-Tα deficiencies. Finally, only 3% of CP cells were clearly involved in T cell differentiation, suggesting that these structures may have additional physiological roles in the gut.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND AIMS\nMechanisms regulating M-cell formation are still poorly understood. In vitro studies showed that lymphocytes trigger the conversion of enterocyte cell lines into M cell-like cells on coculture, whereas in vivo their role in M cell differentiation is still elusive. Our aim was first to examine Rag-1-/- mice, lacking B and T lymphocytes, for the presence of intestinal M cells. Second, we investigated the role of lymphotoxin alphabeta signaling on M-cell formation, given its pivotal role in the development of mouse Peyer's patches.\n\n\nMETHODS\nSmall intestines of Rag-1-/- mice, injected or not with soluble lymphotoxin beta receptor-immunoglobulin fusion protein, were analyzed morphologically using whole mount cytochemical staining, immunohistochemistry, and electron microscopy.\n\n\nRESULTS\nSmall Peyer's patch-like aggregates were found in Rag-1-/- mice in normal number and location. The overlying epithelium of such aggregates was reduced in size but still harbored M cells. In vivo neutralization of lymphotoxin beta-receptor signaling partially reduced the percentage of M cells.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe absence of mature lymphocytes does not prevent the formation of M cells, indicating that the signaling molecules that support M-cell differentiation, such as lymphotoxin alphabeta, may also be supplied by non-B and non-T cells. Mature B lymphocytes, however, are required for the formation of a full-sized follicle-associated epithelium.",

    "abstract": "Rearrangement of the immunoglobulin (Ig) and T cell receptor (TCR) gene loci allows for the generation of B and T lymphocytes with antigen- specific receptors. Complete rearrangement and expression of the TCR- beta chain enables immature thymocytes to differentiate from the CD4- CD8- to the CD4+CD8+ stage mice in which rearrangement is impaired, such as severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice or recombinase activating gene-deficient (RAG-/-) mice, lack mature B and T lymphocytes. Thymocytes from these mice are arrested at the CD4-CD8- stage of T cell development. We previously observed that thymocytes from RAG-2-/- mice exposed to gamma radiation differentiate from CD4- CD8- into CD4+CD8+ without TCR-beta chain rearrangement. We now report that irradiated RAG-2-/- thymocytes undergo direct somatic mutations at the p53 gene locus, and that p53 inactivation is associated with maturation of RAG2-/- thymocytes to the CD4+CD8+ stage. Generation of RAG2-/- and p53-/- double-deficient mice revealed that, in the absence of TCR-beta chain rearrangement, loss of p53 function is sufficient for CD4-CD8- thymocytes to differentiate into the CD4+CD8+ stage of T cell development. Our data provide evidence for a novel p53 mediated checkpoint in early thymocyte development that regulates the transition of CD4-CD8- into CD4+CD8+ thymocytes.",

    "title": "Ablation of thymic export causes accelerated decay of naïve CD4 T cells in the periphery because of activation by environmental antigen",
    "abstract": "A model of chemical thymectomy by inducible Rag ablation was used to study peripheral T cell homeostasis. Induction of Rag ablation was efficient and complete, leading to cessation of thymic T cell production within 3–4 weeks. The decay of peripheral T cells became apparent with a delay of an additional 2–3 weeks and was entirely accounted for by loss of naïve T cells, whereas numbers of memory phenotype and regulatory T cells were not decreased. Naïve CD4 T cells decayed with an average half-life of 50 days, whereas naïve CD8 T cells exhibited a considerably longer half-life. The rapid decay of naïve CD4 T cells was not caused by intrinsic survival differences compared with naïve CD8 T cells, but was caused by changes in the lymphopenic environment resulting in higher microbial load and consequential activation. This finding suggests that in lymphopenic conditions involving compromised thymic function replenishment and survival of a naïve CD4 T cell repertoire may be severely curtailed because of chronic activation. Such a scenario might play a role in the aging immune system and chronic viral infection, such as HIV infection, and contribute to loss of CD4 T cells and impaired immune function. As our data show, continued replenishment with cells from the thymus seems to be required to maintain efficient gut mucosal defense.",

    "title": "Itm2a Is Induced during Thymocyte Selection and T Cell Activation and Causes Downregulation of Cd8 When Overexpressed in Cd4+Cd8+ Double Positive Thymocytes",
    "abstract": "To identify novel genes that are involved in positive selection of thymocytes, we performed polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based subtractive hybridization between selecting and nonselecting thymi. OT-1 T cell receptor (TCR) transgenic thymocytes on a recombination activating gene (RAG) null background are efficiently selected into the CD8 lineage in H-2b mice (RAG-2−/−OT-1, selecting thymi), but are not selected on a transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP) null background (RAG-2−/−TAP-1−/−OT-1, nonselecting thymi). We report here our studies of one gene, ITM2A, whose expression is dramatically higher in T cells in the selecting thymus. The expression pattern of ITM2A in thymocyte subsets correlates with upregulation during positive selection. In addition, ITM2A expression is higher in the thymus than in either the spleen or lymph nodes, but can be upregulated in peripheral T cells upon activation. ITM2A expression was also induced in RAG-2−/− thymocytes in vivo upon CD3 cross-linking. We demonstrate that ITM2A is a type II membrane glycoprotein that exists as two species with apparent Mr of 45 and 43 kD and appears to localize primarily to large cytoplasmic vesicles and the Golgi apparatus, but is also expressed on the cell surface. Expression on the surface of EL4 cells increases with activation by phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) and ionomycin. Finally, overexpression of ITM2A under control of the lck proximal promoter in mice results in partial downregulation of CD8 in CD4+CD8+ double positive (DP) thymocytes, and a corresponding increase in the number of CD4+CD8lo thymocytes. Possible roles for this novel activation marker in thymocyte development are discussed.",

    "title": "MyD88-Dependent Pathway in T Cells Directly Modulates the Expansion of Colitogenic CD4+ T Cells in Chronic Colitis1",
    "abstract": "TLRs that mediate the recognition of pathogen-associated molecular patterns are widely expressed on/in cells of the innate immune system. However, recent findings demonstrate that certain TLRs are also expressed in conventional TCRαβ+ T cells that are critically involved in the acquired immune system, suggesting that TLR ligands can directly modulate T cell function in addition to various innate immune cells. In this study, we report that in a murine model of chronic colitis induced in RAG-2−/− mice by adoptive transfer of CD4+CD45RBhigh T cells, both CD4+CD45RBhigh donor cells and the expanding colitogenic lamina propria CD4+CD44high memory cells expresses a wide variety of TLRs along with MyD88, a key adaptor molecule required for signal transduction through TLRs. Although RAG-2−/− mice transferred with MyD88−/−CD4+CD45RBhigh cells developed colitis, the severity was reduced with the delayed kinetics of clinical course, and the expansion of colitogenic CD4+ T cells was significantly impaired as compared with control mice transferred with MyD88+/+CD4+CD45RBhigh cells. When RAG-2−/− mice were transferred with the same number of MyD88+/+ (Ly5.1+) and MyD88−/− (Ly5.2+) CD4+CD45RBhigh cells, MyD88−/−CD4+ T cells showed significantly lower proliferative responses assessed by in vivo CFSE division assay, and also lower expression of antiapoptotic Bcl-2/Bcl-xL molecules and less production of IFN-γ and IL-17, compared with the paired MyD88+/+CD4+ T cells. Collectively, the MyD88-dependent pathway that controls TLR signaling in T cells may directly promote the proliferation and survival of colitogenic CD4+ T cells to sustain chronic colitis.",

    "title": "Radiosensitive SCID patients with Artemis gene mutations show a complete B-cell differentiation arrest at the pre-B-cell receptor checkpoint in bone marrow.",
    "abstract": "Severe combined immunodeficiency disease (SCID) can be immunologically classified by the absence or presence of T, B, and natural killer (NK) cells. About 30% of T(-)B(-)NK(+) SCID patients carry mutations in the recombination activating genes (RAG). Some T(-)B(-)NK(+) SCID patients without RAG gene mutations are sensitive to ionizing radiation, and several of these radiosensitive (RS) SCID patients were recently shown to have large deletions or truncation mutations in the Artemis gene, implying a role for Artemis in DNA double-strand break (dsb) repair. We identified 5 RS-SCID patients without RAG gene mutations, 4 of them with Artemis gene mutations. One patient had a large genomic deletion, but the other 3 patients carried simple missense mutations in conserved amino acid residues in the SNM1 homology domain of the Artemis protein. Extrachromosomal V(D)J recombination assays showed normal and precise signal joint formation, but inefficient coding joint formation in fibroblasts of these patients, which could be complemented by the wild-type Artemis gene. The cells containing the missense mutations in the SNM1 homology domain had the same recombination phenotype as the cells with the large deletion, indicating that these amino acid residues are indispensable for Artemis function. Immunogenotyping and immunophenotyping of bone marrow samples of 2 RS-SCID patients showed the absence of complete V(H)-J(H) gene rearrangements and consequently a complete B-cell differentiation arrest at the pre-B-cell receptor checkpoint-that is, at the transition from CyIgmu(-) pre-B-I cells to CyIgmu(+) pre-B-II cells. The completeness of this arrest illustrates the importance of Artemis at this stage of lymphoid differentiation.",

    "title": "Cooperative Roles of CTLA-4 and Regulatory T Cells in Tolerance to an Islet Cell Antigen",
    "abstract": "Adoptive transfer of ovalbumin (OVA)-specific T cells from the DO.11 TCR transgenic mouse on a Rag−/− background into mice expressing OVA in pancreatic islet cells induces acute insulitis and diabetes only if endogenous lymphocytes, including regulatory T cells, are removed. When wild-type OVA-specific/Rag−/− T cells, which are all CD25−, are transferred into islet antigen–expressing mice, peripheral immunization with OVA in adjuvant is needed to induce diabetes. In contrast, naive CTLA-4−/−/Rag−/− OVA-specific T cells (also CD25−) develop into Th1 effectors and induce disease upon recognition of the self-antigen alone. These results suggest that CTLA-4 functions to increase the activation threshold of autoreactive T cells, because in its absence self-antigen is sufficient to trigger autoimmunity without peripheral immunization. Further, CTLA-4 and regulatory T cells act cooperatively to maintain tolerance, indicating that the function of CTLA-4 is independent of regulatory cells, and deficiency of both is required to induce pathologic immune responses against the islet self-antigen.",

    "abstract": "Crude oil was treated with purified emulsan, the heteropolysaccharide bioemulsifier produced by Acinetobacter calcoaceticus RAG-1. A mixed bacterial population as well as nine different pure cultures isolated from various sources was tested for biodegradation of emulsan-treated and untreated crude oil. Biodegradation was measured both quantitatively and qualitatively. Recovery of 14CO2 from mineralized 14C-labeled substrates yielded quantitative data on degradation of specific compounds, and capillary gas chromatography of residual unlabeled oil yielded qualitative data on a broad spectrum of crude oil components. Biodegradation of linear alkanes and other saturated hydrocarbons, both by pure cultures and by the mixed population, was reduced some 50 to 90% after emulsan pretreatment. In addition, degradation of aromatic compounds by the mixed population was reduced some 90% in emulsan-treated oil. In sharp contrast, aromatic biodegradation by pure cultures was either unaffected or slightly stimulated by emulsification of the oil.",

    "abstract": "Summary. Human megakaryocyte colonies were grown from the bone marrow in plasma clot or methyl cellulose cultures. Maturation of the megakaryocytic cells was sequentially studied from day 5 to day 16 of culture by fluorescent labelling with a panel of monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies against different platelet glycopro‐teins (Gp), PI AI antigen, factor VIII RAg platelet factor 4 (PF 4), fibrinogen and platelet‐derived growth factor (PDGF). Expression of Gp Ib was also studied by immunogold technique at electron microscopy. The first cells identifiable by these antibodies were found at day 5 of culture. They had the size of a lymphocyte. These small megakaryocyte precursors already expressed all the platelet antigens, HLA‐DR and transferrin receptors and were devoid of erythroid or myeloid markers. Among the platelet antigens, Gp IIIa was the most sensitive marker for the identification of these precursors. However, double‐fluorescent labelling demonstrated that the different platelet markers were coexpressed in a large majority of cells. Interestingly, cytoplasmic markers demonstrated that these small megakaryocyte precursors were themselves heterogenous by morphological criteria. During maturation, expression of Gps, particularly of Gp Ib, increased while the labelling pattern of anti factor VIII RAg and anti PF 4 antibodies switched from diffuse to granular staining. PDGF could also be detected in the megakaryocytes grown in culture.",

    "abstract": "Gene assembly of the variable domain of antigen receptors is initiated by DNA cleavage by the RAG1–RAG2 protein complex at sites flanking V, D, and J gene segments. Double-strand breaks are produced via a single-strand nick that is converted to a hairpin end on coding DNA and a blunt end on the neighboring recombination signal sequence. We demonstrate that the C-terminal regions of purified murine RAG1 (aa 1009–1040) and RAG2 (aa 388–520, including a plant homeodomain [PHD domain]) collaborate to inhibit the hairpinning stage of DNA cleavage. The C-terminal region of RAG2 stabilizes the RAG1/2 heterotetramer but destabilizes the RAG–DNA precleavage complex. This destabilization is reversed by binding of the PHD domain to a histone H3 peptide trimethylated on lysine 4 (H3K4me3). The addition of H3K4me3 likewise alleviates the RAG1/RAG2 C-terminus-mediated inhibition of hairpinning and the PHD-mediated inhibition of transposition activity. Thus a negative regulatory function of the noncore regions of RAG1/2 limits the RAG endonuclease activity in the absence of an activating methylated histone tail bound to the complex.",

    "title": "Dexamethasone, beta-estradiol, and 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin elicit thymic atrophy through different cellular targets.",
    "abstract": "The effects of single doses of dexamethasone (DEX), beta-estradiol-17-valerate (E2), and 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) on the kinetics of thymic atrophy and related bone marrow and thymocyte phenotype alterations were examined. The results imply differences in the mechanisms by which these compounds act. Of the three compounds, DEX induced maximal atrophy by 3 days with complete recovery by Day 12. At the point of maximal atrophy, the RAG-1+TdT+CD4+8+3int thymocyte population was proportionately the most depleted. In contrast, TCDD and E2 caused maximal thymic atrophy by Day 12. E2 treatment, like DEX, resulted in a preferential decrease in the RAG-1+TdT+CD4+8+3int population, but unlike DEX, this decrease persisted. TCDD-induced thymic atrophy resulted from a proportional loss of all classes of thymocytes. There was no significant relative reduction of TdT+RAG-1+ cells by TCDD in the thymus. A slow and persistent reduction of TdT and RAG-1 in bone marrow by both TCDD and E2 contrasted with the rapid reduction and quick recovery of these markers in marrow from DEX-treated animals. Additional studies showed that only DEX-induced atrophy was accompanied by the induction of thymocyte apoptosis, as detected by multiple nucleosomal length DNA fragments within the first 24 hr. The different kinetics and proportions of subsets in the atrophied thymuses, as well as the distinct patterns of alterations of RAG and TdT expression, and the presence or the absence of apoptosis provide evidence for different mechanisms of thymic atrophy by these agents. The slow induction and longer persistence of thymic atrophy induced by E2 and TCDD, as well as their effects on bone marrow stem cell markers, suggest that bone marrow thymocyte precursors are major targets for these agents.",

    "abstract": "Mutant mice with defined T cell deficiencies were infected with Mycobacterium bovis bacillus Calmette Guérin (BCG) and the relative contribution of α/β T cells and γ/δ T cells to the host immune response was assessed. Recombinase activating gene (RAG‐1)−/− mutants as well as T cell receptor (TcR) β−/−, but not TcR‐δ−/−, mutants succumbed to M. bovis BCG infection and failed to develop granulomatous lesions. Antigen‐induced IFN‐γ production by spleen cells in vitro was abrogated in RAG‐1−/− mutants and markedly diminished in TcR‐β−/− and TcR‐δ−/− mice. Reconstitution experiments suggest that both α/β and γ/δ T cells are essential for antigen‐specific IFN‐γ secretion. Our data formally prove the crucial role of α/β T cells and reveal accessory functions of γ/δ T cells in optimum immunity against M. bovis BCG.",

    "title": "Extrathymic T Cell Lymphopoiesis",
    "abstract": "In the absence of thymopoiesis, T lymphocytes are nevertheless present, mainly in the gut epithelium. Ontogeny of the extrathymic pathway and the extent of its involvement in euthymic mice are controversial. These questions have been addressed by assessing the expression of recombinase activating gene (RAG) through the use of green fluorescent protein RAG2 transgenic mouse models. In athymic mice, T lymphopoiesis occurs mainly in the mesenteric lymph node and less in the Peyer's patches. Ontogenic steps of this lymphopoiesis resemble those of thymopoiesis, but with an apparent bias toward γδ T cell production and with a paucity of oligoclonal αβ T cells possibly resulting from a deficit in positive selection. Whether in athymic or euthymic mice, neither T intraepithelial lymphocytes (IEL) nor cryptopatch cells (reported to contain precursors of IEL) displayed fluorescence indicating recent RAG protein synthesis. Newly made T cells migrate from the mesenteric node into the thoracic duct lymph to reach the gut mucosa. In euthymic mice, this extrathymic pathway is totally repressed, except in conditions of severe lymphocytic depletion. Thus, in normal animals, all gut T IEL, including CD8αα+ cells, are of thymic origin, CD8αα+ TCRαβ+ IEL being the likely progeny of double negative NK1-1− thymocytes, which show polyclonal Vα and Vβ repertoires.",

In connexin32 (cx32)-deficient (cx32(def)) mice, which mimic the X-linked dominant form of CMT (CMTX), T-lymphocyte and macrophage numbers are also significantly elevated in peripheral nerves. To test the hypothesis that immune cells are indeed pathogenic in this model, we cross-bred cx32(def) mice with recombination activating gene-1 (RAG-1)-deficient mice, which lack mature T- and B-lymphocytes. In these immunoincompetent double mutants, the number of endoneurial macrophages was reduced. Furthermore, features indicative of myelin degeneration and axonopathic changes were mitigated in the RAG-1-deficient double mutants, whereas enlarged periaxonal Schwann cell collars, a hallmark specific for cx32-mutants, were not reduced. Since both cx32- and P0 deficiency lead to similar immunopathogenic processes, we conclude that immune-mediated demyelination may be a feature common to many CMT-like neuropathies independent of the genetic origin.",

    "abstract": "By using mice genomically lacking IFN-gammaR, IL-12, perforin, and recombination-activating gene-1 (RAG-1), we analyzed the regulation and importance of IFN-gamma in the control of infection with Chlamydia pneumoniae. IL-12 participates in resistance of mice to C. pneumoniae, probably by regulating the protective levels of IFN-gamma mRNA. In turn, IFN-gamma is necessary for the increased IL-12p40 mRNA accumulation that occurs in lungs during infection with C. pneumoniae, suggesting a positive feedback regulation between these two cytokines. In experiments including RAG-1-/-/IFN-gammaR-/- mice we showed that IFN-gamma produced by innate cells controls the bacterial load and is necessary for the increased accumulation of transcripts for enzymes controlling high output NO release (inducible NO synthase), superoxide production (gp-91 NADPH oxidase), and catalysis of tryptophan (indoleamine 2, 3-dioxygenase (IDO)), mechanisms probably related to bacterial killing. Adaptive immune responses diminish the levels of IFN-gamma and IL-12 mRNA and thereby the levels of inducible NO synthase, IDO, and gp91 NADPH oxidase transcripts. By using RAG-1-/-/perforin-/- mice, we excluded the overt participation of NK cell cytotoxicity in the control of C. pneumoniae. However, NK cells and probably other innate immune cells release IFN-gamma during the bacterial infection.",

    "abstract": "N‐(4‐Hydroxyphenyl) retinamide (4HPR) and retinoyl beta‐glucuronide (RAG) are two derivatives of all‐trans retinoic acid (RA) that show properties both similar to as well as different from their parent compound, RA. Both retinoids possess the important property of showing much‐reduced toxicity relative to RA while maintaining significant biological activity. 4HPR, a synthetic derivative, is active in the prevention and treatment of a variety of neoplasms in animals, and by inducing apoptosis, shows growth inhibitory activity against many human tumor cell types in vitro. In humans, 4HPR reduces the incidence of new occurrences of leukoplakia and is currently being tested as a preventive agent for breast cancer. RAG, a naturally occurring metabolite of RA, effectively stimulates the growth of vitamin A‐deficient animals, induces the differentiation of epithelial cells in vivo and in vitro, and is effective in the topical treatment of acne in humans. Unlike RA, RAG is nontoxic when applied to the skin and is nonteratogenic when given orally to rats. Possible mechanisms of action of both compounds are discussed. These two derivatives of retinoids show interesting physiologic effects and potentially beneficial pharmacologic actions.—Formelli, F., Barua, A. B., Olson, J. A.

    "title": "IL-7 Functionally Segregates the Pro-B Cell Stage by Regulating Transcription of Recombination Mediators across Cell Cycle",
    "abstract": "Ag receptor diversity involves the introduction of DNA double-stranded breaks during lymphocyte development. To ensure fidelity, cleavage is confined to the G0-G1 phase of the cell cycle. One established mechanism of regulation is through periodic degradation of the RAG2 recombinase protein. However, there are additional levels of protection. In this paper, we show that cyclical changes in the IL-7R signaling pathway functionally segregate pro-B cells according to cell cycle status. In consequence, the level of a downstream effector of IL-7 signaling, phospho-STAT5, is inversely correlated with cell cycle expression of Rag, a key gene involved in recombination. Higher levels of phopho-STAT5 in S-G2 correlate with decreased Rag expression and Rag relocalization to pericentromeric heterochromatin. These cyclical changes in transcription and locus repositioning are ablated upon transformation with v-Abl, which renders STAT5 constitutively active across the cell cycle. We propose that this activity of the IL-7R/STAT5 pathway plays a critical protective role in development, complementing regulation of RAG2 at the protein level, to ensure that recombination does not occur during replication. Our data, suggesting that pro-B cells are not a single homogeneous population, explain inconsistencies in the role of IL-7 signaling in regulating Igh recombination.",

    "title": "Marginal Zone B Cell Is a Major Source of Il-10 in Listeria monocytogenes Susceptibility",
    "abstract": "Rag-1–knockout (KO) mice are highly resistant to Listeria monocytogenes infection. The role played by the many Rag-1–dependent lymphocyte lineages was studied using a genetic approach in which each Rag-1–dependent lymphocyte lineage was eliminated one at a time. Only B cell-deficient Igh-KO mice displayed reduced bacterial load and improved survival upon Listeria infection. Listeria infection of Rag-1–KO and Il-10–KO hosts that had been adoptively transferred with wild-type marginal zone B (MZB) cells, but not follicular B cells, resulted in heightened bacterial load and increased Il-10 production in the spleen, but not the liver. This MZB cell-dependent increase in bacterial load was eliminated by anti–Il-10 mAb. In addition, Listeria infection of MZB cell-deficient Rbpj-cKO mice showed decreased bacterial load and increased survival. Whereas multiple cell types have been shown to be capable of Il-10 production, our results indicate that the MZB cell is the most dominant and relevant Il-10 source in the context of Listeria susceptibility. In marked contrast to the generally protective nature of MZB cells in defending against pathogenic infection, our results demonstrate that MZB cells play a detrimental role in Listeria infection and possibly other infections as well.",

    "title": "Maintenance of Pulmonary Th1 Effector Function in Chronic Tuberculosis Requires Persistent IL-12 Production",
    "abstract": "The mechanisms that prevent reactivation of latent Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection in asymptomatic individuals are poorly understood. Although IL-12 is critical for the induction of IFN-γ-dependent host control of M. tuberculosis, the requirement for the cytokine in the maintenance of host resistance and pulmonary Th1 effector function has not yet been formally examined. In this study, we reconstituted IL-12p40-deficient mice with IL-12 during the first 4 wk of infection and then assessed the effects of cytokine withdrawal. Although IL-12 administration initially resulted in restricted mycobacterial growth and prolonged survival, the reconstituted animals eventually succumbed to infection. This breakdown in bacterial control was accompanied by a marked reduction in the numbers of IFN-γ-producing CD4+ T cells in lungs. Moreover, whereas CD4+ T cells isolated from chronically infected wild-type mice expanded and transferred long-term protection to M. tuberculosis-challenged RAG−/− mice, they failed to do so in IL-12p40-deficient RAG−/− recipients and were clearly reduced in frequency within pulmonary granulomas in the latter animals. These studies establish that continuous IL-12 production is necessary for maintenance of the pulmonary Th1 cells required for host control of persistent M. tuberculosis infection and suggest that breakdown of this mechanism could be a contributing factor in reactivated disease.",

We reviewed endothelial and vascular histopathologic changes on light microscopy and on immunoperoxidase stained sections of skin biopsies obtained from 41 HLA-identical allogeneic marrow transplant recipients with at least grade 2 GVHD. Biopsies taken from 14 allogeneic HLA-identical bone marrow transplant recipients who never developed GVHD were used as controls. Sections were evaluated for evidence of immunologic vascular injury using the rank file analysis of histologic features, expression of HLA-DR antigen, and the distribution of fibrin and factor VIII-related antigen (F VIII RAg). Patients with acute GVHD had significantly greater intimal lymphocytic infiltrates, perivascular nuclear dust deposition, perivascular F VIII Rag extravasation and deposition and vascular proliferation than controls. We find significantly greater endothelial injury in GVHD patients, which may represent primary immunologic injury to the vasculature. The clinical findings in acute GVHD probably result from cumulative endothelial as well as epithelial injury.",

    "title": "The plasticity of immunoglobulin gene systems in evolution",
    "abstract": "Summary:  The mechanism of recombination‐activating gene (RAG)‐mediated rearrangement exists in all jawed vertebrates, but the organization and structure of immunoglobulin (Ig) genes, as they differ in fish and among fish species, reveal their capability for rapid evolution. In systems where there can exist 100 Ig loci, exon restructuring and sequence changes of the constant regions led to divergence of effector functions. Recombination among these loci created hybrid genes, the strangest of which encode variable (V) regions that function as part of secreted molecules and, as the result of an ancient translocation, are also grafted onto the T‐cell receptor. Genomic changes in V‐gene structure, created by RAG recombinase acting on germline recombination signal sequences, led variously to the generation of fixed receptor specificities, pseudogene templates for gene conversion, and ultimately to Ig sequences that evolved away from Ig function. The presence of so many Ig loci in fishes raises interesting questions not only as to how their regulation is achieved but also how successive whole‐locus duplications are accommodated by a system whose function in other vertebrates is based on clonal antigen receptor expression.",

Here we show that IL-12-induced immune responses are partially impaired in T and NKT cell-deficient RAG-2(-/-) mice, and in NKT cell-deficient CD1(-/-) mice. In response to a small dose (<1000 U) of IL-12, RAG-2(-/-) and CD1(-/-) mice demonstrated reduced cytotoxicity, serum IFN-gamma elevation and anti-metastatic activities; in contrast, in response to a high dose (>2000 U) of IL-12, the IL-12-induced immune responses of RAG-2(-/-) and CD1(-/-) mice were indistinguishable from wild-type mice. The defective responses to low-dose IL-12 of RAG-2(-/-) mice were corrected by adoptive transfer of NKT cells but not NK cells. These findings indicate that both NK and NKT cells contribute to the anti-metastatic responses induced by IL-12, and that NKT cells are mostly responsible for the low-dose activities of this cytokine.",

    "title": "Critical Influence of Natural Regulatory CD25+ T Cells on the Fate of Allografts in the Absence of Immunosuppression",
    "abstract": "Background. Allografts are occasionally accepted in the absence of immunosuppression. Because naturally occurring CD4+CD25+ regulatory T cells (natural CD25+ Treg cells) have been shown to inhibit allograft rejection, we investigated their influence on the outcome of allografts in nonimmunosuppressed mouse recipients. Methods. We compared survival times of male CBA/Ca skin grafts in female CBA/Ca recipients expressing a transgenic anti-HY T-cell receptor on a RAG-1+/+ (A1[M]RAG+) or a RAG-1−/− (A1[M]RAG−) background. Depletion of natural CD25+ Treg cells in A1[M]RAG+ mice was achieved by in vivo administration of the PC61 monoclonal antibody. The influence of natural CD25+ Treg cells on the fate of major histocompatibility complex class II-mismatched (C57BL/6× bm12)F1 skin or bm12 heart transplants in C57BL/6 recipients was also assessed. Finally, we investigated the impact of natural CD25+ Treg cells on the production of T-helper (Th)1 and Th2 cytokines in mixed lymphocyte cultures between C57BL/6 CD4+ CD25− T cells as responders and bm12 or (C57BL/6× bm12)F1 antigen-presenting cells as stimulators. Results. Male allografts were spontaneously accepted by female A1(M)RAG+ mice but readily rejected by female A1(M)RAG+ mice depleted of natural CD25+ Treg cells by pretreatment with the PC61 monoclonal antibody. Depletion of CD25+ Treg cells also enhanced eosinophil-determined rejection of (C57BL/6× bm12)F1 skin grafts or bm12 cardiac grafts in C57BL/6 recipients. Finally, natural CD25+ Treg cells inhibited the production of interleukin (IL)-2, interferon-γ, IL-5, and IL-13 in mixed lymphocyte culture in a dose-dependent manner. Conclusion. Natural CD25+ Treg cells control Th1- and Th2-type allohelper T-cell responses and thereby influence the fate of allografts in nonimmunosuppressed recipients.",

    "abstract": "Although IL-7 has recently emerged as a key cytokine involved in controlling the homeostatic turnover and the survival of peripheral resting memory CD4+ T cells, its potential to be sustained pathogenic CD4+ T cells in chronic immune diseases, such as inflammatory bowel diseases, still remains unclear. In this study, we demonstrate that IL-7 is essential for the development and the persistence of chronic colitis induced by adoptive transfer of normal CD4+CD45RBhigh T cells or colitogenic lamina propria (LP) CD4+ memory T cells into immunodeficient IL-7+/+ × RAG-1−/− and IL-7−/− × RAG-1−/− mice. Although IL-7+/+ × RAG-1−/− recipients transferred with CD4+CD45RBhigh splenocytes developed massive inflammation of the large intestinal mucosa concurrent with massive expansion of Th1 cells, IL-7−/− × RAG-1−/− recipients did not. Furthermore, IL-7−/− × RAG-1−/−, but not IL-7+/+ × RAG-1−/−, mice transferred with LP CD4+CD44highCD62L−IL-7Rαhigh effector-memory T cells (TEM) isolated from colitic CD4+CD45RBhigh-transferred mice did not develop colitis. Although rapid proliferation of transferred colitogenic LP CD4+ TEM cells was observed in the in IL-7−/− × RAG-1−/− mice to a similar extent of those in IL-7+/+ × RAG-1−/− mice, Bcl-2 expression was significantly down-modulated in the transferred CD4+ T cells in IL-7−/− × RAG-1−/− mice compared with those in IL-7+/+ × RAG-1−/− mice. Taken together, IL-7 is essential for the development and the persistence of chronic colitis as a critical survival factor for colitogenic CD4+ TEM cells, suggesting that therapeutic approaches targeting IL-7/IL-7R signaling pathway may be feasible in the treatment of inflammatory bowel diseases.",

    "title": "Cellular FLICE-inhibitory protein is required for T cell survival and cycling",
    "abstract": "Fas-associated death domain (FADD) and caspase-8 are key signal transducers for death receptor–induced apoptosis, whereas cellular FLICE-inhibitory protein (cFLIP) antagonizes this process. Interestingly, FADD and caspase-8 also play a role in T cell development and T cell receptor (TCR)–mediated proliferative responses. To investigate the underlying mechanism, we generated cFLIP-deficient T cells by reconstituting Rag −/− blastocysts with cFLIP-deficient embryonic stem cells. These Rag chimeric mutant mice (rcFLIP −/−) had severely reduced numbers of T cells in the thymus, lymph nodes, and spleen, although mature T lymphocytes did develop. Similar to FADD- or caspase-8–deficient cells, rcFLIP −/− T cells were impaired in proliferation in response to TCR stimulation. Further investigation revealed that cFLIP is required for T cell survival, as well as T cell cycling in response to TCR stimulation. Interestingly, some signaling pathways from the TCR complex appeared competent, as CD3 plus CD28 cross-linking was capable of activating the ERK pathway in rcFLIP −/− T cells. We demonstrate an essential role for cFLIP in T cell function.",

    "title": "An amphioxus RAG1-like DNA fragment encodes a functional central domain of vertebrate core RAG1",
    "abstract": "Significance Recombination activating gene (RAG)-mediated variable, diversity, and joining [V(D)J] gene recombination is the hallmark of the adaptive immunity that only exists in jawed vertebrates. The evolutionary origin of RAG remains largely unknown although many hypotheses have been proposed. This study indicates that a RAG1-like DNA fragment (bfRAG1L) from the invertebrate amphioxus might encode a functional central domain of vertebrate core RAG1. We show that bfRAG1L (if translated) is a virus-related protein that can degrade both DNA and RNA and is able to introduce V(D)J gene recombination in RAG1-deficient mice after the reconstitution of bfRAG1L into a core RAG1-like protein. In this paper, we propose a model for the evolutionary process of RAG1 in the combination of previous hypotheses, and it provides unique insights into the origin and evolution of RAG1. The highly diversified repertoire of antigen receptors in the vertebrate immune system is generated via proteins encoded by the recombination activating genes (RAGs) RAG1 and RAG2 by a process known as variable, diversity, and joining [V(D)J] gene recombination. Based on the study of vertebrate RAG proteins, many hypotheses have been proposed regarding the origin and evolution of RAG. This issue remains unresolved, leaving a significant gap in our understanding of the evolution of adaptive immunity. Here, we show that the amphioxus genome contains an ancient RAG1-like DNA fragment (bfRAG1L) that encodes a virus-related protein that is much shorter than vertebrate RAG1 and harbors a region homologous to the central domain of core RAG1 (cRAG1). bfRAG1L also contains an unexpected retroviral type II nuclease active site motif, DXN(D/E)XK, and is capable of degrading both DNA and RNA. Moreover, bfRAG1L shares important functional properties with the central domain of cRAG1, including interaction with RAG2 and localization to the nucleus. Remarkably, the reconstitution of bfRAG1L into a cRAG1-like protein yielded an enzyme capable of recognizing recombination signal sequences and performing V(D)J recombination in the presence of mouse RAG2. Moreover, this reconstituted cRAG1-like protein could mediate the assembly of antigen receptor genes in RAG1-deficient mice. Together, our results demonstrate that amphioxus bfRAG1L encodes a protein that is functionally equivalent to the central domain of cRAG1 and is well prepared for further evolution to mediate V(D)J recombination. Thus, our findings provide unique insights into the evolutionary origin of RAG1.",

    "abstract": "The variable (V), (diversity [D]), and joining (J) region recombinases (recombination activating genes [RAGs]) can perform like transposases and are thought to have initiated development of the adaptive immune system in early vertebrates by splitting archaic V genes with transposable elements. In cartilaginous fishes, the immunoglobulin (Ig) light chain genes are organized as multiple VJ-constant (C) clusters; some loci are capable of rearrangement while others contain fused VJ. The latter may be key to understanding the evolutionary role of RAG. Are they relics of the archaic genes, or are they results of rearrangement in germ cells? Our data suggest that some fused VJ genes are not only recently rearranged, but also resulted from RAG-like activity involving hairpin intermediates. Expression studies show that these, like some other germline-joined Ig sequences, are expressed at significant levels only early in ontogeny. We suggest that a rejoined Ig gene may not merely be a sequence restricting antibody diversity, but is potentially a novel receptor no longer tied to somatic RAG expression and rearrangement. From the combined data, we arrived at the unexpected conclusion that, in some vertebrates, RAG is still an active force in changing the genome.",

    "abstract": "The morphologic transformation of the developing zebrafish thymus from 1 week postfertilization (wpf) to 15 wpf is described. The thymus overall morphology changed from a small pouch‐like shape at 1 wpf to a conical shape between 2 and 3 wpf before acquiring a more complex shape from 4 wpf onward. Rapid growth rate along the lateral axis at the region near the pharyngeal epithelium occurred between 1 and 2 wpf, whereas rapid growth rate along the dorsal‐ventral axis occurred between 3 and 6 wpf. Expansion of thymocyte population beginning from 1 wpf became more evident by 2 to 3 wpf, as indicated by the apparent increase of different sizes of lymphocytes, recombination activating gene‐1 (rag‐1), and T‐cell antigen receptor alpha chain constant region (TCRAC) ‐positive cells. Tissue section in situ hybridization (ISH) analysis with rag‐1 probe reveals that cortex‐medullary regionalization has begun between 1 and 2 wpf as rag‐1 expression clearly demarcated the cortex, whereas the medulla was rag‐1 negative. The presence of TCRAC‐positive cells in the medulla by 2–3 wpf, suggests that the thymic selection processes had begun. The zebrafish thymus is morphologically mature by 3 wpf. Early signs of thymic involution were observed in zebrafish aged 15 wpf. © 2002 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.",

    "abstract": "Control of the acute phase of Trypanosoma cruzi infections is critically dependent on cytokine-mediated macrophage activation to intracellular killing. We investigated the roles of IL-10, TNF, IFN-gamma, and IL-12 in the control of parasitism by innate and specific immunity. Mice with disrupted IL-10 genes (IL-10 KO) infected with Y strain T. cruzi have lower parasite numbers in the blood and tissues and higher IFN-gamma and nitric oxide (NO) production by spleen cells than wild type (WT) mice. Treatment of IL-10 KO and WT mice with recombinant IL-10 resulted in increased parasitemia. Mice with disrupted recombinase-activating genes (RAG/KO) that lack B and T cells provided a model for determining the importance of innate immunity to resistance. RAG/KO and WT mice had similar parasitemia levels until Day 13 of infection, suggestive of effective control of parasitism by the innate immune system during the early phase of infection; from them on parasitemia was higher in RAG/KO. Double RAG/IL-10 KO mice and RAG/KO mice had superimposable parasitemia curves, indicating that in the absence of T and B cells, endogenous IL-10 does not limit the efficacy of the innate immune system. Treatment of infected RAG/KO, IL-10/KO, and WT mice with anti-IFN-gamma, anti-TNF, or anti-IL-12 neutralizing mAbs increased parasitemia levels showing the importance of endogenous production of these cytokines in the control of parasitism by innate and specific immune responses. Spleen cells from anti-IL 12-treated WT mice had diminished production of IFN-gamma and NO, suggesting that early IFN-gamma synthesis is most dependent on IL-12 stimulation.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT In many cases of neurological disease associated with viral infection, such as measles virus (MV)-induced subacute sclerosing panencephalitis in children, it is unclear whether the virus or the antiviral immune response within the brain is the cause of disease. MV inoculation of transgenic mice expressing the human MV receptor, CD46, exclusively in neurons resulted in neuronal infection and fatal encephalitis within 2 weeks in neonates, while mice older than 3 weeks of age were resistant to both infection and disease. At all ages, T lymphocytes infiltrated the brain in response to inoculation. To determine the role of lymphocytes in disease progression, CD46+ mice were back-crossed to T- and B-cell-deficient RAG-2 knockout mice. The lymphocyte deficiency did not affect the outcome of disease in neonates, but adult CD46+RAG-2− mice were much more susceptible to both neuronal infection and central nervous system disease than their immunocompetent littermates. These results indicate that CD46-dependent MV infection of neurons, rather than the antiviral immune response in the brain, produces neurological disease in this model system and that immunocompetent adult mice, but not immunologically compromised or immature mice, are protected from infection.",

    "abstract": "Mouse germinal center (GC) B cells have been shown to undergo secondary V(D)J (V, variable; D, diversity; J, joining) recombination (receptor editing) mediated by the reexpressed products of recombination activating gene (RAG)-1 and RAG-2. We show here that interleukin (IL)-7 as well as IL-4 was effective in inducing functional RAG products in mouse IgD+ B cells activated via CD40 in vitro. Blocking of the IL-7 receptor (IL-7R) by injecting an anti– IL-7R monoclonal antibody resulted in a marked suppression of the reexpression of RAG-2 and subsequent V(D)J recombination in the draining lymph node of immunized mice, whereas RAG-2 expression was not impaired in immunized IL-4–deficient mice. Further, these peripheral B cells activated in vitro or in vivo were found to express IL-7R. These findings indicate a novel role for IL-7 and IL-7R in inducing receptor editing in GC B cells.",

    "abstract": "Mutations in the human RAG genes that impair, but do not abolish, recombination activity lead to Omenn syndrome, a severe primary immune deficiency that is associated with clinical and pathological features of graft-versus-host disease and oligoclonal expansion of activated, autologous T cells. We have analyzed the mechanisms accounting for peripheral oligoclonality of the T-cell repertoire. Predominance of few T-cell receptor clonotypes (both within TCRAB- and within TCRGD-expressing lymphocytes) is already detectable in the thymus and is further selected for in the periphery, with a different distribution of clonotypes in different tissues. These data indicate that oligoclonality of the T-cell repertoire in Omenn syndrome is due both to intrathymic restriction and to peripheral expansion. Moreover, the RAG genes defect that causes Omenn syndrome directly affects early stages of V(D)J recombination, but does not alter the process of double-strand-break DNA repair, including N and P nucleotide insertion.",

To elucidate the cellular requirements for this complex phenotype, we have bred RelB-deficient (RelB(kappaO)) animals to two strains of immunodeficient mice, recombinase-activating gene-1-deficient (RAG-1(kappaO), lacking B and T cells), and Nur77/N10-transgenic mice (Nur77/N10(TG), lacking only T cells). We also generated mutant mice deficient in both RelB and the p50 subunit of NF-kappaB (p50(kappaO), multiple defects in B cell function). RelB(kappaO)RAG-1(kappaO) and RelB(kappaO)Nur77/N10(TG) mice are disease-free, while RelB(kappaO)p50(kappaO) double-mutant animals develop an even more severe phenotype despite the absence of B cells in the inflammatory infiltrates. Thus, both multiorgan inflammation and myeloid hyperplasia in RelB-deficient mice are T cell dependent, whereas B cells are not crucially involved.",

    "title": "No Requirement for V(D)J Recombination in p53-Deficient Thymic Lymphoma",
    "abstract": "ABSTRACT The p53 tumor suppressor is activated in response to a variety of cellular stress signals, although specific in vivo signals that trigger tumor suppression are unknown. In mouse thymocytes, where p53 inactivation leads to tumorigenesis, several observations suggest that V(D)J recombination of T-cell receptor (TCR) loci could provide a DNA damage signal triggering p53-dependent apoptosis and tumor suppression. Inactivation of p53 would allow V(D)J driven mutation of additional cancer genes, facilitating tumorigenesis. Here, we show that mice with a p53 deficiency in thymocytes and unable to carry out V(D)J recombination are not impaired in the development of thymoma. Recombination-activating gene (RAG) deficiencies were introduced into both p53−/− mice and TgTΔN transgenic mice, a strain in which 100% of the mice develop thymoma due to thymocyte-specific inactivation of p53 by a simian virus 40 T-antigen variant. V(D)J recombination was dispensable for tumorigenesis since thymomas developed with or without the RAG-1 or RAG-2gene, although some delay was observed. When V(D)J recombination was suppressed by expression of rearranged TCR transgenes, 100% of the TgTΔN mice developed thymoma, surprisingly with reduced latency. Further introduction of a RAG deficiency into these mice had no impact on the timing or frequency of tumorigenesis. Finally, karyotype and chromosome painting analyses showed no evidence for TCR gene translocations in p53-deficient thymomas, although abundant aneuploidy involving frequent duplication of certain chromosomes was present. Thus, contrary to the current hypothesis, these studies indicate that signals other than V(D)J recombination promote p53 tumor suppression in thymocytes and that the mechanism of tumorigenesis is distinct from TCR translocation oncogene activation.",

    "abstract": "Thymocytes and thymic dendritic cell (DC) lineages develop simultaneously and may originate from a common intrathymic progenitor. Mice deficient for two growth factor receptor molecules [c-kit and the common cytokine receptor gamma chain (gamma(c))] lack all thymocytes including T cell progenitors. Despite this lack of pro-T cells, thymic DC compartments were identified in c-kit(-)gamma(c)(-) mice. Thus, c-kit- and gamma(c)-mediated signals are not essential to generate thymic DCs. In addition, pro-T cells do not appear to be obligatory progenitors of thymic DCs, because DC development is dissociated from the generation of thymocytes in these mice. Thymic DCs in c-kit(-)gamma(c)(-) mice are phenotypically and functionally normal. In contrast to wild-type mice, however, thymic DCs in c-kit(-)gamma(c)(-) and, notably, in RAG-2-deficient mice are CD8alpha(neg/low), indicating that CD8alpha expression on thymic DCs is not independent of thymocytes developing beyond the \"RAG-block.\"",

    "title": "V(D)J Recombinase Binding and Cleavage of Cryptic Recombination Signal Sequences Identified from Lymphoid Malignancies*",
    "abstract": "V(D)J recombination is a process integral to lymphocyte development. However, this process is not always benign, since certain lymphoid malignancies exhibit recurrent chromosomal abnormalities, such as translocations and deletions, that harbor molecular signatures suggesting an origin from aberrant V(D)J recombination. Translocations involving LMO2, TAL1, Ttg-1, and Hox11, as well as a recurrent interstitial deletion at 1p32 involving SIL/SCL, are cited examples of illegitimate V(D)J recombination. Previous studies using extrachromosomal substrates reveal that cryptic recombination signal sequences (cRSSs) identified near the translocation breakpoint in these examples support V(D)J recombination with efficiencies ranging from about 30- to 20,000-fold less than bona fide V(D)J recombination signals. To understand the molecular basis for these large differences, we investigated the binding and cleavage of these cRSSs by the RAG1/2 proteins that initiate V(D)J recombination. We find that the RAG proteins comparably bind all cRSSs tested, albeit more poorly than a consensus RSS. We show that four cRSSs that support levels of V(D)J recombination above background levels in cell culture (LMO2, TAL1, Ttg-1, and SIL) are also cleaved by the RAG proteins in vitro with efficiencies ranging from 18 to 70% of a consensus RSS. Cleavage of LMO2 and Ttg-1 by the RAG proteins can also be detected in cell culture using ligation-mediated PCR. In contrast, Hox11 and SCL are nicked but not cleaved efficiently in vitro, and cleavage at other adventitious sites in plasmid substrates may also limit the ability to detect recombination activity at these cRSSs in cell culture.",

    "abstract": "Bone marrow stromal cells promote B cell development involving recombinase gene-directed rearrangement of the immunoglobulin genes. We observed that the stromal cell-derived cytokine interleukin 7 (IL-7) enhances the expression of CD19 molecules on progenitor B-lineage cells in human bone marrow samples and downregulates the expression of terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) and the recombinase- activating genes RAG-1 and RAG-2. Initiation of the TdT downregulation on the first day of treatment, CD19 upregulation during the second day, and RAG-1 and RAG-2 downmodulation during the third day implied a cascade of IL-7 effects. While CD19 ligation by divalent antibodies had no direct effect on TdT or RAG gene expression, CD19 cross-linkage complete blocked the IL-7 downregulation of RAG expression without affecting the earlier TdT response. These results suggest that signals generated through CD19 and the IL-7 receptor could modulate immunoglobulin gene rearrangement and repertoire diversification during the early stages of B cell differentiation.",

We evaluated the roles of RORγt-expressing cells in mouse acute hepatitis model using RORγt deficient (RORγt−/−) mice and RAG-2 and RORγt double deficient (RAG-2−/− × RORγt−/−) mice. Acute hepatitis was induced in mice by injection with carbon tetrachloride (CCl4), to investigate the regulation of liver inflammation by RORγt-expressing cells. We detected RORC expression in three compartments, CD4+ T cells, NKT cells, and lineage marker-negative SCA-1+Thy1high ILCs, of the liver of wild type (WT) mice. CCl4-treated RORγt−/− mice developed liver damage in spite of lack of RORγt-dependent cells, but with reduced infiltration of macrophages compared with WT mice. In this regard, ILCs were significantly decreased in RAG-2−/− × RORγt−/− mice that lacked T and NKT cells. Surprisingly, RAG-2−/− × RORγt−/− mice developed significantly severer CCl4-induced hepatitis compared with RAG-2−/− mice, in accordance with the fact that hepatic ILCs failed to produce IL-22. Lastly, anti-Thy1 monoclonal antibody (mAb), but not anti-NK1.1 mAb or anti-asialo GM1 Ab administration exacerbated liver damage in RAG-2−/− mice with the depletion of liver ILCs. Collectively, hepatic RORγt-dependent ILCs play a part of protective roles in hepatic immune response in mice.",

    "title": "Aberrant V(D)J Recombination in Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated-Deficient Lymphocytes Is Dependent on Nonhomologous DNA End Joining1",
    "abstract": "During lymphocyte Ag receptor gene assembly, DNA cleavage by the Rag proteins generates pairs of coding and signal ends that are normally joined into coding joints and signal joints, respectively, by the classical nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ) pathway of DNA double strand break repair. Coding and signal ends can also be aberrantly joined to each other, generating hybrid joints, through NHEJ or through NHEJ-independent pathways, such as Rag-mediated transposition. Hybrid joints do not participate in the formation of functional Ag receptor genes and can alter the configuration of Ag receptor loci in ways that limit subsequent productive rearrangements. The formation of these nonfunctional hybrid joints occurs rarely in wild type lymphocytes, demonstrating that mechanisms exist to limit both the NHEJ-dependent and the NHEJ-independent joining of a signal end to a coding end. In contrast to wild-type cells, hybrid joint formation occurs at high levels in ataxia telangiectasia mutated (Atm)-deficient lymphocytes, suggesting that Atm functions to limit the formation of these aberrant joints. In this study, we show that hybrid joint formation in Atm-deficient cells requires the NHEJ proteins Artemis, DNA-PKcs, and Ku70, demonstrating that Atm functions primarily by modulating the NHEJ-dependent, and not the NHEJ-independent, joining of coding ends to signal ends.",

    "abstract": "IgH and L chain transgenes encoding a phosphocholine (PC)-specific Ig receptor were introduced into recombinase-activating gene (Rag-2−/−) knockout mice. The PC-specific B cells that developed behaved like known autoreactive lymphocytes. They were 1) developmentally arrested in the bone marrow, 2) unable to secrete Ab, 3) able to escape clonal deletion and develop into B1 B cells in the peritoneal cavity, and 4) rescued by overexpression of bcl-2. A second IgL chain was genetically introduced into Rag-2−/− knockout mice expressing the autoreactive PC-specific Ig receptor. These dual L chain-expressing mice had B cells in peripheral lymphoid organs that coexpressed both anti-PC Ab as well as Ab employing the second available L chain that does not generate an autoreactive PC-specific receptor. Coexpression of the additional Ig molecules rescued the autoreactive anti-PC B cells and relieved the functional anergy of the anti-PC-specific B cells, as demonstrated by detection of circulating autoreactive anti-PC-Abs. We call this novel mechanism by which autoreactive B cells can persist by compromising allelic exclusion receptor dilution. Rescue of autoreactive PC-specific B cells would be beneficial to the host because these Abs are vital for protection against pathogens such as Streptococcus pneumoniae.",

    "title": "Primitive Lymphoid Progenitors in Bone Marrow with T Lineage Reconstituting Potential1",
    "abstract": "Multiple subsets of the bone marrow contain T cell precursors, but it remains unclear which is most likely to replenish the adult thymus. Therefore, RAG-1+ early lymphoid progenitors (RAG-1+ ELP), and CD62L/L-selectin+ progenitors (LSP), as well as common lymphoid progenitors from C57BL6-Thy1.1-RAG-1/GFP mouse bone marrow were directly compared in transplantation assays. The two c-Kithigh populations vigorously regenerated the thymus and were superior to common lymphoid progenitors in magnitude and frequency of thymic reconstitution. Regeneration was much faster than the 22 days described for transplanted stem cells, and RAG-1+ ELP produced small numbers of lymphocytes within 13 days. As previously reported, LSP were biased to a T cell fate, but this was not the case for RAG-1+ ELP. Although RAG-1+ ELP and LSP had reduced myeloid potential, they were both effective progenitors for T lymphocytes and NK cells. The LSP subset overlapped with and included most RAG-1+ ELP and many RAG-1−TdT+ ELP. LSP and RAG-1+ ELP were both present in the peripheral circulation, but RAG-1+ ELP had no exact counterpart among immature thymocytes. The most primitive of thymocytes were similar to Lin−c-KithighL-selectin+TdT+RAG-1− progenitors present in the marrow, suggesting that this population is normally important for sustaining the adult thymus.",

    "abstract": "Early thymocyte development was compared in normal, recombinase-activating gene 2-inactivated (RAG-2 KO) and pre-T cell receptor alpha-inactivated (pre-Talpha KO) mice, mutants representing either a complete (RAG-2 KO) or partial (pre-Talpha KO) block in progenitor development. Using three colour analysis with antibodies to CD117, CD44 and CD25, cell numbers in each progenitor subset were quantified, demonstrating an accumulation of cells prior to the block. Progenitor number was influenced both by the nature of the genetic block and thymus size, as shown in the enlarged thymus of a transgenic mouse line. By four colour staining for CD3, CD117, CD44 and CD25 and deliberately not gating out CD3(-) cells, a novel aspect of gamma delta T cell development in pre-Talpha KO mice was identified. 5-bromodeoxyuridine labelling and subsequent four colour staining for BrdU, CD117, CD44 and CD25 showed firstly that DN1 cells were cycling, secondly that the developmental block in pre-Talpha KO mice corresponded to a decrease in DN4 cell proliferation, and thirdly provided a novel 'snapshot' of T cell receptor beta-selected cells transiting the DN3 to DN4 compartment. Taken together, these results emphasise the need for a more detailed qualitative and quantitative analysis of the progenitor compartment in the thymus.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT The importance of V(D)J recombination for generating diversity in the immune system is well established, but the mechanisms which regulate V(D)J recombination are still poorly understood. Although transcription of unrearranged (germ line) immunoglobulin and T-cell receptor gene segments often precedes V(D)J recombination and has been implicated in its control, the actual role of germ line transcripts in V(D)J recombination is not known. We used a sensitive reverse transcription-PCR assay to study immunoglobulin VH germ line transcripts in proB lines from RAG-deficient mice. All 10 VH families analyzed were germ line transcribed, and germ line transcription was found in all of the cell lines examined, indicating that active chromatin was present in the VHregion. However, not all VH families were germ line transcribed in every cell line, and there was a surprising lack of uniformity in the number and family distribution of germ line VH transcripts in individual lines. When V(D)J recombination was activated by restoration of RAG activity, recombinational activity of endogenous VH genes for which germ line transcription was observed could be compared with those of genes for which it was not observed. This analysis revealed multiple examples of endogenous VH gene segments which were rearranged in cells where their germ line transcription was not detectable prior to RAG expression. Thus, our data provide strong support for the idea that V-(D)J recombination does not require germ line transcription of the recombining variable gene segment.",

    "title": "A functional B cell receptor transgene allows efficient IL-7-independent maturation of B cell precursors.",
    "abstract": "IL-7 supports the proliferation of B cell precursors, but inhibits their maturation to mature surface IgM+ (sIgM+) B cells. This inhibition is thought to occur by direct or indirect down-regulation of recombinase genes, preventing the B cells from undergoing Ig light chain rearrangements. To directly analyze the IL-7 inhibitory effects, we studied B cell development and maturation in B cells bearing a transgenic (Tg) B cell receptor (BCR). We show here that proliferation of Tg B cell precursors is IL-7 dependent both in vivo and in vitro and is comparable to that of non-Tg B cell precursors. Tg B cell precursors grown on stroma and IL-7 expressed sIgM on >90% of the cells, and a large proportion of these cells coexpressed additional maturation markers such as IgD, CD23, CD21, and L-selectin, indicating that IL-7 does not inhibit maturation of Tg B cell precursors. The presence of the Tg inhibited V(D)J recombination in the cultured cells, as very low levels of recombination activating genes 2 (RAG-2) expression and endogenous V-Jkappa DNA rearrangements were found. Expression levels of RAG mRNAs were not significantly changed after removal of IL-7 from the in vitro Tg B cell cultures. In contrast, we found that IL-7 inhibited maturation of non-Tg B cell precursors and that removal of IL-7 resulted in a significant increase in RAG-2 expression and kappa rearrangements, thus allowing the B cells to express sIgM and to mature. These results suggest that IL-7-mediated inhibition of Ig gene rearrangement blocks maturation of B cell precursors and that the presence of Tg BCR efficiently circumvents this inhibition.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT The recombination activating genes RAG-1 andRAG-2 are expressed in a lymphoid-cell-specific and developmentally regulated fashion. To understand the transcriptional basis for this regulation, we have cloned and characterized the murineRAG-2 promoter. The promoter was lymphoid cell specific, showing activity in various B- and T-cell lines but little activity in nonlymphoid cells. To our surprise, however, the promoter was regulated differently in B and T cells. Using nuclear extracts from B-cell lines, we found that the B-cell-specific transcription factor BSAP (Pax-5) could bind to a conserved sequence critical for promoter activity. BSAP activated the promoter in transfected cells, and the BSAP site was occupied in a tissue-specific manner in vivo. An overlapping DNA sequence binding to a distinct factor was necessary for promoter activity in T cells. Full promoter activity in T cells was also dependent on a more distal DNA sequence whose disruption had no effect on B-cell activity. The unexpected finding that a B-cell-specific factor regulates the RAG-2 promoter may explain some of the recently observed differences in the regulation of RAGtranscription between B and T cells.",

    "title": "Regulation of RAG1/RAG2‐mediated transposition by GTP and the C‐terminal region of RAG2",
    "abstract": "The RAG1 and RAG2 proteins perform critical DNA recognition and cleavage functions in V(D)J recombination, and also catalyze efficient DNA transposition in vitro. No transposition in vivo by the RAG proteins has been reported, suggesting regulation of the reaction by as yet unknown mechanisms. Here we report that RAG‐mediated transposition is suppressed by physiological concentrations of the guanine nucleotide GTP, and by the full‐length RAG2 protein. Both GTP and full‐length RAG2 inhibit transposition by blocking the non‐covalent ‘capture’ of target DNA, and both are capable of inhibiting RAG‐mediated hybrid joint formation in vitro. We also observe that another intracellular signaling molecule, Ca2+, stimulates RAG‐mediated transposition and is capable of activating transposition even in reactions containing full‐length RAG2 and GTP. RAG‐mediated transposition has been proposed to contribute to the chromosomal translocations that underlie the development of lymphoid malignancies, and our findings highlight regulatory mechanisms that might prevent such occurrences, and circumstances in which these regulatory mechanisms could be overcome.",

    "title": "Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein deficiency in innate immune cells leads to mucosal immune dysregulation and colitis in mice.",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND & AIMS\nImmunodeficiency and autoimmune sequelae, including colitis, develop in patients and mice deficient in Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (WASP), a hematopoietic cell-specific intracellular signaling molecule that regulates the actin cytoskeleton. Development of colitis in WASP-deficient mice requires lymphocytes; transfer of T cells is sufficient to induce colitis in immunodeficient mice. We investigated the interactions between innate and adaptive immune cells in mucosal regulation during development of T cell-mediated colitis in mice with WASP-deficient cells of the innate immune system.\n\n\nMETHODS\nNaïve and/or regulatory CD4(+) T cells were transferred from 129 SvEv mice into RAG-2-deficient (RAG-2 KO) mice or mice lacking WASP and RAG-2 (WRDKO). Animals were observed for the development of colitis; effector and regulatory functions of innate immune and T cells were analyzed with in vivo and in vitro assays.\n\n\nRESULTS\nTransfer of unfractionated CD4(+) T cells induced severe colitis in WRDKO, but not RAG-2 KO, mice. Naïve wild-type T cells had higher levels of effector activity and regulatory T cells had reduced suppressive function when transferred into WRDKO mice compared with RAG-2 KO mice. Regulatory T-cell proliferation, generation, and maintenance of FoxP3 expression were reduced in WRDKO recipients and associated with reduced numbers of CD103(+) tolerogenic dendritic cells and levels of interleukin-10. Administration of interleukin-10 prevented induction of colitis following transfer of T cells into WRDKO mice.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nDefective interactions between WASP-deficient innate immune cells and normal T cells disrupt mucosal regulation, potentially by altering the functions of tolerogenic dendritic cells, production of interleukin-10, and homeostasis of regulatory T cells.",

    "title": "Pregnancy Allows the Transfer and Differentiation of Fetal Lymphoid Progenitors into Functional T and B Cells in Mothers1",
    "abstract": "T lymphocytes of fetal origin found in maternal circulation after gestation have been reported as a possible cause for autoimmune diseases. During gestation, mothers acquire CD34+CD38+ cells of fetal origin that persist decades. In this study, we asked whether fetal T and B cells could develop from these progenitors in the maternal thymus and bone marrow during and after gestation. RAG−/−-deficient female mice (Ly5.2) were mated to congenic wild-type Ly5.1 mice (RAG+/+). Fetal double-positive T cells (CD4+CD8+) with characteristic TCR and IL-7R expression patterns could be recovered in maternal thymus during the resulting pregnancies. We made similar observations in the thymus of immunocompetent mothers. Such phenomenon was observed overall in 12 of 68 tested mice compared with 0 of 51 controls (p = 0.001). T cells could also be found in maternal spleen and produced IFN-γ in the presence of an allogenic or an Ag-specific stimulus. Similarly, CD19+IgM+ fetal B cells as well as plasma Igs could be found in maternal RAG−/− bone marrow and spleen after similar matings. Our results suggest that during gestation mothers acquire fetal lymphoid progenitors that develop into functional T cells. This fetal cell microchimerism may have a direct impact on maternal health.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND & AIMS\nThe glucocorticoid-induced tumor necrosis factor receptor family-related protein (GITR; also called TNFRSF18 or CD357) regulates the T cell-mediated immune response and is present on surfaces of regulatory T (Treg) cells and activated CD4(+) T cells. We investigated the roles of GITR in the development of colitis in mice.\n\n\nMETHODS\nChronic enterocolitis was induced by the transfer of wild-type or GITR(-/-) CD4(+) T cells to GITR(-/-) × Rag(-/-) or Rag(-/-) mice. We determined the severity of colitis by using the disease activity index; measured levels of inflammatory cytokines, T cells, and dendritic cells; and performed histologic analysis of colon samples.\n\n\nRESULTS\nTransfer of nonfractionated CD4(+) cells from wild-type or GITR(-/-) donors induced colitis in GITR(-/-) × Rag(-/-) but not in Rag(-/-) mice. Among mice with transfer-induced colitis, the percentage of Treg and T-helper (Th) 17 cells was reduced but that of Th1 cells increased. Treg cells failed to prevent colitis in GITR(-/-) × Rag(-/-) recipients; this was not the result of aberrant function of GITR(-/-) Treg or T effector cells but resulted from an imbalance between the numbers of tolerogenic CD103(+) and PDCA1(+) plasmacytoid dendritic cells in GITR(-/-) mice. This imbalance impaired Treg cell development and expanded the Th1 population in GITR(-/-) × Rag(-/-) mice following transfer of nonfractionated CD4(+) cells.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nGITR is not required on the surface of Treg and T effector cells to induce colitis in mice; interactions between GITR and its ligand are not required for induction of colitis. GITR instead appears to control dendritic cell and monocyte development; in its absence, mice develop aggravated chronic enterocolitis via an imbalance of colitogenic Th1 cells and Treg cells.",

    "title": "NF-κB Is Required Within the Innate Immune System to Inhibit Microflora-Induced Colitis and Expression of IL-12 p401",
    "abstract": "We have previously presented evidence demonstrating that mice deficient in NF-κB subunits are susceptible to colitis induced by the pathogenic enterohepatic Helicobacter species, H. hepaticus. However, it has not been determined whether NF-κB is required within inhibitory lymphocyte populations, within cells of the innate immune system, or both, to suppress inflammation. To examine these issues, we have performed a series of adoptive transfer experiments using recombination-activating gene (Rag)-2−/− or p50−/−p65+/−Rag-2−/− mice as hosts for wild-type (WT) and p50−/−p65+/− lymphocyte populations. We have shown that although the ability of H. hepaticus to induce colitis in Rag-2−/− mice is inhibited by the presence of either WT or p50−/−p65+/− splenocytes, these splenocyte populations are unable to suppress H. hepaticus-induced colitis in p50−/−p65+/−Rag-2−/− mice. Colitis in these animals is characterized by increased expression of inflammatory cytokines including IL-12 p40, and depletion of IL-12 p40 from p50−/−p65+/− mice ameliorates H. hepaticus-induced disease. Consistent with a primary defect in the regulation of IL-12 expression, H. hepaticus induced markedly higher levels of IL-12 p40 in p50−/−p65+/− macrophages than in WT macrophages. These results suggest that inhibition of H. hepaticus-induced IL-12 p40 expression by NF-κB subunits is critical to preventing colonic inflammation in response to inflammatory microflora.",

Symptomatic parameters were checked daily and histological changes were scored.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAlthough development of colitis in Rag-1 knockout mice treated with high dose (5%) of DSS was comparable to that in B6 control mice, colitis progression was much more tolerable in Rag-1 knockout mice compared to than in B6 mice treated with low dose (1.5%) DSS. Symptomatic parameters as well as histopathologic changes were improved in Rag-1 knockout mice.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThese results indicate that the presence of lymphocytes contributes to colitis progression at low dose of DSS stimulation. Lymphocytes may play roles as an aggravating factor in DSS-induced colitis.",

The proposed method is based on a Markovian regularization of an elevation field defined on a region adjacency graph (RAG). This RAG is obtained by oversegmenting the optical image. The support for elevation hypotheses is given by the structural matching of features extracted from both SAR images. The regularization model takes into account discontinuities of buildings thanks to an implicit edge process. Starting from a good initialization, optimization is obtained through an iterated conditional mode algorithm.",

    "abstract": "Neoplastic angioendotheliomatosis (NAE) is a rare entity characterized by multifocal, intravascular proliferation of large pleomorphic cells within small vessels of most organs, with a particular affinity for the central nervous system. Clinically, patients with NAE present with focal neurologic signs and a progressive decline in mental status, followed by death in a few months. The histogenesis of NAE is controversial but has been previously thought to represent a malignant proliferation of endothelial cells. Three autopsy cases with clinical and histologic features of NAE were investigated by electron microscopic, standard histochemical, and immunohistochemical technics that included the use of three panleukocyte monoclonal antibodies (PLA), the endothelial-cell-specific reagents, FVIII-RAG anti-sera and Ulex europaeus agglutinin (UEA), and muramidase. The NAE cells in all three cases were stained positively by the PLA, whereas the adjacent endothelial cells and not the NAE cells were stained by FVIII-RAG and UEA. Muramidase by immunoperoxidase technic and nonspecific esterase (chloracetate) were not present in NAE cells. These results indicate that NAE is a leukocyte-derived neoplasm and not a malignant endothelial cell neoplasm. Based on these findings and on a review of the literature, it is proposed that NAE represents intravascular malignant lymphomatosis (IML). IML appears to be a primary manifestation and/or a major secondary form of disseminated malignant lymphoma. This would explain the spectrum of findings in previously reported cases.",

    "title": "The Outcome of Polymicrobial Sepsis Is Independent of T and B CellS",
    "abstract": "The contribution of the adaptive and innate immune systems to the pathogenesis and outcome of sepsis remains a fundamental yet controversial question. Here, we use mice lacking the recombination activating gene 1 (Rag-1) to study the role of T and B cells in sepsis after cecal ligation and puncture (CLP). Spleens of Rag-1−/− mice were atrophic and completely devoid of CD3+ T cells and CD19+ B cells. Wild-type mice and Rag-1−/− mice (both on a C57BL/6J background) underwent CLP or sham surgery. Both wild-type and Rag-1−/− mice developed clinical signs of sepsis within the first day after CLP. This included severe hypothermia as measured by a decrease in body surface temperature and organ dysfunction as detected by plasma increases in blood urea nitrogen and lactate dehydrogenase levels. Survival curves of wild-type and Rag-1−/− mice after CLP were superimposable, with 35% survival in the wild-type group and 27% survival in the Rag-1−/− group, respectively (not significant, P = 0.875). Using multiplex bead-based assays, the mediator concentrations for 23 cytokines and chemokines were measured in plasma of wild-type and Rag-1−/− mice 8 h after CLP or sham surgery. Compared with sham surgery mice, the highest mediator levels were observed for granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, keratinocyte chemoattractant, IL-6, monocyte chemotactic protein 1, and IL-10. Levels for most mediators were unaffected by the absence of T and B lymphocytes. Only the concentrations of IL-6 and IL-17 were found to be significantly lower in Rag-1−/− mice compared with wild-type mice. In conclusion, the absence of T and B cells in the CLP model used does not appear to affect the acute outcome of severe sepsis.",

    "title": "IFN‐γ production by innate immune cells is sufficient for development of hypersensitivity pneumonitis",
    "abstract": "Hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP) is an interstitial lung disease that develops following repeated exposure to inhaled particulate antigens. The disease is characterized by lymphocytic alveolitis, granuloma formation and fibrosis. IFN‐γ is required for the formation of granulomas in HP, and we therefore focused on identifying the cellular sources of IFN‐γ during the disease. Using the Saccharopolyspora rectivirgula (SR) animal model of HP, we demonstrated that the majority of IFN‐γ+ cells in the lung following SR exposure are neutrophils. Ab‐mediated depletion of neutrophils in mice prior to exposure to SR resulted in a decrease in the level of IFN‐γ mRNA and protein compared to isotype Ab‐treated mice, suggesting that neutrophils are an important source of IFN‐γ during HP. To determine the contribution of T and non‐T cell sources of IFN‐γ to granuloma formation, we performed adoptive transfer studies. RAG‐1–/– mice reconstituted with spleen cells from IFN‐γ–/– mice developed granulomas similarly to RAG‐1–/– mice reconstituted with normal spleen cells. Therefore innate immune cell IFN‐γ production in the absence of T cell IFN‐γ production is sufficient for granuloma formation. These results provide new insight into the pathogenesis of HP and demonstrate the important contribution of innate immune cells to the disease process.",

    "title": "Role of NK Cells and Gamma Interferon in Transplacental Passage of Toxoplasma gondii in a Mouse Model of Primary Infection",
    "abstract": "ABSTRACT Protective immunity in mice infected with Toxoplasma gondii is mainly mediated by NK cells, CD4 and CD8 T cells, and type 1 cytokines, such as gamma interferon (IFN-γ). To clarify the roles of NK cells and IFN-γ in protection against primary congenital toxoplasmosis, we used recombination activating gene 2 knockout (RAG-2−/−) mice, which lack T and B lymphocytes, in comparison with the wild-type BALB/c model. RAG-2−/− mice had a significantly lower risk of fetal toxoplasmosis than BALB/c mice (25 versus 63.9%; P = 0.003). This protection was associated with an increased number of maternal NK cells, IFN-γ secretion by spleen cells, and decreased parasitemia. In the RAG-2−/− mice, NK cell depletion increased both the rate of fetal infection, to 56.5% (P = 0.02), and the blood parasite burden. Conversely, in the BALB/c mice, this treatment did not modify maternofetal transmission or the blood parasite burden. Neutralization of IFN-γ in both infected RAG-2−/− and BALB/c mice decreased congenital Toxoplasma transmission, contrasting with an exacerbation of maternal infection. These data suggest that a partially protective immunity against congenital toxoplasmosis is achieved due to the increased number of NK cells in RAG-2−/− mice. However, it seems that IFN-γ enhances, directly or indirectly, the transplacental transmission.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this prospective split-mouth-study was to compare the 5-months-healing results after implantation of resorbable (Polyglactin-910) and non-resorbable (e-PTFE) GTR-membranes. 12 healthy patients with 41 periodontal defects were treated. Radiographical and clinical examinations (papillary bleeding index, gingival recession, probing pocket depth, probing attachment level, and furcation depth) were carried out under standardized conditions immediately before and 5 months after surgery. The vertical relative attachment gain (V-rAG) was calculated as a % of the bony defect depth (intra-operatively measured) at baseline, and the horizontal relative attachment gain (H-rAG) as a % of the furcation depth at baseline. The standardized radiographs were evaluated blind by 4 experienced examiners for changes of the alveolar bone. Furthermore, digital subtraction radiography was carried out using the standard deviation of the grey level histograms in the experimental region and in a control region as a test parameter for bone changes. Both types of membranes achieved an attachment gain. Using the split-mouth-design, no statistically significant (< or = 0.05) difference between the two membranes could be detected (number of defects/median) with regard to V-rAG (Polyglactin: 12/77.5%, e-PTFE: 12/73.2%) or to H-rAG of class-II-furcations (Polyglactin: 5/66.7%, e-PTFE: 5/66.7%), or to bone changes using conventional and subtraction radiographic evaluation. In conclusion based on this 5-months-study, the resorbable membranes provided attachment gain comparable to the e-PTFE-membranes.",

Since HCP is expressed in many cell types and protein phosphorylation is a major mechanism of regulating protein function, it is not surprising that the motheaten phenotype is pleiotropic. It is commonly thought that immune system involvement causes this disease. If so, the motheaten disease ought to be alleviated when the recombination activation gene-1 (RAG-1) is disrupted because there will be no V(D)J rearrangement and thus impaired development of B and T cells. We bred homozygous, double- mutant me(v)/me(v) x RAG 1 -/- mice and found that, in fact, inflamed paws, and splenomegaly with elevated myelopoiesis. Thus, except for autoantibodies, the motheaten phenotype does not depend on the presence of B and T cells. This observation cautions the use of motheaten mice as a model of autoimmune disease.",

Our light and ultrastructural studies are in essential agreement with the previous suggestion of the cndothelial nature of the neoplasm and our demonstration of the presence of FVIII RAG in many of the tumor cells offers new evidence strongly supportive of their endothelial differentiation. We believe that IVBAT and a group of cxtrapulmonary tumors described as epithelioid hcmangiocndothclioma and endovascular papillary angioendothelioma are similar biologically indolent neoplasms of epithelioid and dendritic cndothelial cells characterized by stromal sclerosis, intravascular spread, a low incidence of metastases and slow clinical evolution.

    "abstract": "Acinetobacter calcoaceticus RAG-1 and BD413, as well as Streptococcus pyogenes M-5, adhered to octane. Adherence was inhibited by emulsan (100 micrograms/ml), the polymeric emulsifying agent produced by A. calcoaceticus RAG-1. Emulsan also inhibited adherence of S. pyogenes and RAG-1 to buccal epithelial cells. The mean values of bound S. pyogenes per epithelial cell were 57.2 and 20.7 for the control and emulsan-containing suspensions, respectively; mean values of bound RAG-1 per epithelial cell were 221 for the control and 40 for the suspension containing 100 micrograms of emulsan per ml. Desorption of previously bound RAG-1 from epithelial cells by emulsan was concentration dependent: a maximum of 80% desorption was obtained with 200 micrograms of emulsan per ml. The data showing that emulsan desorbed 70% of the indigenous bacterial flora from buccal epithelial cells suggest that hydrophobic interactions mediate not only the in vitro adherence of laboratory strains to epithelial cells, but actually govern the adherence of the majority of the bacteria that colonize this surface. The advantages of using emulsan as an antiadherence agent include its chemical purity, stability, and polymeric nature.",

    "abstract": "In order to isolate cDNA clones for DNA-binding components of the V-(D)-J recombinase, phage libraries from a pre-B-cell line were screened with a radiolabeled probe containing recombination signal sequences (RSS). Among prospective clones, cDNA T160 was analyzed further. It produced a protein of 80.6 kDa which bound to DNA containing RSS but not to DNA in which the RSS had been mutated. A search of a data base revealed that the T160 protein has significant sequence homology (56%) to the nonhistone chromosomal protein HMG1 within the C-terminal region of 80 amino acids. DNA-binding analysis with truncated proteins showed that the HMG homology region is responsible for DNA binding. Using restriction fragment length polymorphisms, the T160 gene was mapped at the proximal end of mouse chromosome 2. Evidence was obtained for genetic linkage between the T160 gene and the recombination activator genes RAG-1 and RAG-2.",

    "abstract": "Rapid analysis of mechanisms that regulate V(D)J recombination has been hampered by the lack of appropriate cell systems that reproduce aspects of normal prelymphocyte physiology in which the recombinase is activated, accessible antigen receptor loci are rearranged, and rearrangement status is fixed by termination of recombinase expression. To generate such a system, we introduced heat shock-inducible V(D)J recombination-activating genes (RAG) 1 and 2 into a recombinationally inert B-cell line. Heat shock treatment of these cells rapidly induced high levels of RAG transcripts and RAG proteins that were accompanied by a parallel induction of V(D)J recombinase activity, strongly suggesting that RAG proteins have a primary role in V(D)J recombination. Within hours after induction, these cells began to rearrange chromosomally integrated V(D)J recombination substrates but only if the substrates contained an active transcriptional enhancer; substrates lacking an enhancer were not efficiently rearranged. Activities necessary to target integrated substrates for rearrangement were provided by two separate lymphoid-specific transcriptional enhancers, as well as an active nonlymphoid enhancer, unequivocally demonstrating that such elements enhance both transcription and V(D)J recombinational accessibility.",

    "abstract": "CD4+Foxp3+ Treg maintain peripheral tolerance and influence immune responses to foreign antigens. The thymus is an important source of Treg, but controversy exists as to whether T cells are selected into the Treg lineage based on signals received through TCR specific for self‐peptides. To examine the specificity of TCR expressed by Treg and its effect on CD4+ T‐cell development, we generated Treg‐TCR transgenic mice. Deletion of >90% of CD4+ T cells in RAG‐sufficient mice, and nearly 100% deletion in RAG−/− mice expressing this TCR indicate that the TCR is specific for an unknown, naturally expressed peptide in the thymus. Deletion occurs late in development, suggesting this peptide is presented by APC in the thymic medulla. These studies are the first to describe the effects of expressing a Treg‐TCR on CD4+ T‐cell development. The implications of our data for models of Treg selection are discussed.",

    "abstract": "The mechanisms responsible for peripheral CD8 T cell tolerance to foreign Ags remain poorly understood. In this study we have characterized the state of CD8 T cell tolerance induced in F5 TCR transgenic mice by multiple peptide injections in vivo. The tolerant state of CD8 T cells is characterized by impaired proliferative responses, increased sensitivity to cell death, and failure to acquire cytotoxic effector function after in vitro antigenic challenge. In vivo monitoring of CD8 T cell proliferation using 5-carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester showed that a large subset of the tolerant T cell population failed to divide in response to peptide. TCR down-regulation could not account for this loss of responsiveness to Ag since recombination-activating gene-1 (RAG-1)-/-F5 CD8 T cell responses were similar to those of RAG-1(-/-)F5 x RAG-1(-/-)F1 T lymphocytes, which express lower levels of the transgenic TCR. Analysis of early signal transduction in tolerant CD8 T cells revealed high basal levels of cytoplasmic calcium as well as impaired calcium mobilization and tyrosine phosphorylation after cross-linking of CD3epsilon and CD8alpha. Together these data indicate that repeated exposure to soluble antigenic peptide in vivo can induce a state of functional tolerance characterized by defective TCR signaling, impaired proliferation, and increased sensitivity to cell death.",

Recent results indicate their applicability also to generating semantic services in interactive editors. For use in editors, it is necessary to update the attribution after edit operations. Earlier algorithms based on statically scheduled incremental attribute evaluation are, however, not applicable to RAGs, as they do not account for the dynamic dependencies that reference attributes give rise to. In this report, we introduce a notion of consistency for RAG attributions, along with an algorithm for maintaining consistency after edit operations, based on dynamic dependency tracking. That is, we introduce a means to do incremental evaluation of RAGs using dynamic dependency tracking. (Less)",

    "title": "An Opposite Pattern of Selection of a Single T Cell Antigen Receptor in the Thymus and among Intraepithelial Lymphocytes",
    "abstract": "The differentiation of intestinal intraepithelial lymphocytes (IEL) remains controversial, which may be due in part to the phenotypic complexity of these T cells. We have investigated here the development of IEL in mice on the recombination activating gene (RAG)-2−/− background which express a T cell antigen receptor (TCR) transgene specific for an H-Y peptide presented by Db (H-Y/Db × RAG-2− mice). In contrast to the thymus, the small intestine in female H-Y/Db × RAG-2− mice is severely deficient in the number of IEL; TCR transgene+ CD8αα and CD8αβ are virtually absent. This is similar to the number and phenotype of IEL in transgenic mice that do not express the Db class I molecule, and which therefore fail positive selection. Paradoxically, in male mice, the small intestine contains large numbers of TCR+ IEL that express high levels of CD8αα homodimers. The IEL isolated from male mice are functional, as they respond upon TCR cross-linking, although they are not autoreactive to stimulator cells from male mice. We hypothesize that the H-Y/Db TCR fails to undergo selection in IEL of female mice due to the reduced avidity of the TCR for major histocompatibility complex peptide in conjunction with the CD8αα homodimers expressed by many cells in this lineage. By contrast, this reduced TCR/CD8αα avidity may permit positive rather than negative selection of this TCR in male mice. Therefore, the data presented provide conclusive evidence that a TCR which is positively selected in the thymus will not necessarily be selected in IEL, and furthermore, that the expression of a distinct CD8 isoform by IEL may be a critical determinant of the differential pattern of selection of these T cells.",

    "title": "Murine Pro-B Cells Require IL-7 and Its Receptor Complex to Up-Regulate IL-7Rα, Terminal Deoxynucleotidyltransferase, and cμ Expression1",
    "abstract": "Phenotypic analysis of bone marrow cells from IL-7 knockout (KO) mice revealed that B cell development is blocked precisely at the transition between pro-B cells and pre-B cells. In contrast, the generation of pre-pro-B cells and pro-B cells appeared to be normal, as judged by total cell numbers, proliferative indexes, D-JH and V-DJH gene rearrangements, and mRNA for recombinase-activating gene-1 (RAG-1), RAG-2, TdT, Igμ, λ5, and VpreB. However, upon closer inspection, several abnormalities in pro-B cell development were identified that could be corrected by injection of rIL-7 in vivo. These included the absence of the subset of late pro-B cells that initiates cμ expression for pre-B cell Ag receptor (BCR) formation, and the failure of pro-B cells to up-regulate TdT and the IL-7Rα (but not the common γ-chain) chain. Similar defects were present in common γ-chain and Jak3 KO mice, but not in λ5 or (excluding cytoplasmic Ig μ heavy chain (cμ)) RAG-1 KO mice, all of which also arrest at the late pro-B cell stage. Consequently, up-regulation of TdT and IL-7Rα expression requires signaling through the high affinity IL-7R, but does not require cμ expression or a functional pre-BCR. Taken together, these results suggest that IL-7 and its receptor complex are essential for 1) up-regulating the expression of TdT and IL-7Rα, 2) initiating the production of cμ, and 3) promoting the formation of a functional pre-BCR in/on pro-B cells. These key events, in turn, appear to be prerequisite both for differentiation of pro-B cells to pre-B cells and for proliferation of these cell subsets upon continued stimulation with IL-7.",

IgM, IgG, and IgE antibodies were all formed in vitro, when the cells were stimulated with DNP-Asc. Stimulation of the same cells with DNP-secondary carrier also resulted in the formation of anti-DNP-antibodies of the three immunoglobulin classes, when donors of lymphocytes received the carrier with alum. Carrier-specific cells generated by the supplemental immunization with the same carrier in complete Freund9s adjuvant (CFA) showed helper function for IgM and IgG antibody response but not for IgE antibody response. Similarly, lymph node cells from the rabbits primed with DNP-Rag and receiving supplemental immunization with Asc in alum responded to DNP-Asc to form IgM, IgG and IgE antibodies. In this system, supplemental immunization with CFA was occasionally effective for IgE antibody response to DNP-Asc, however, alum was a more effective adjuvant than CFA to prepare a carrier-specific cell population having helper function for IgE antibody response. The helper function of the carrier specific cell population for IgE antibody formation did not have any relationship with either the helper function of the same cell population for IgG antibody response or with the size of the carrier-specific cell population estimated by 3 H-thymidine uptake. Evidence was obtained that lack of IgE antibody response to DNP-secondary carrier with the lymphocytes from the CFA group was not due to an increase of precursors of carrier-specific antibody-forming B cells. The results indicated that carrier-specific helper cells for the IgE antibody response were different from those for IgG/IgM antibody response.",

    "title": "Induction of Ig light chain gene rearrangement in heavy chain-deficient B cells by activated Ras.",
    "abstract": "During B cell development, rearrangement and expression of Ig heavy chain (HC) genes promote development and expansion of pre-B cells accompanied by the onset of Ig light chain (LC) variable region gene assembly. To elucidate the signaling pathways that control these events, we have tested the ability of activated Ras expression to promote B cell differentiation to the stage of LC gene rearrangement in the absence of Ig HC gene expression. For this purpose, we introduced an activated Ras expression construct into JH-deleted embryonic stem cells that lack the ability to assemble HC variable region genes and assayed differentiation potential by recombination activating gene (RAG) 2-deficient blastocyst complementation. We found that activated Ras expression induces the progression of B lineage cells beyond the developmental checkpoint ordinarily controlled by mu HC. Such Ras/JH-deleted B cells accumulate in the periphery but continue to express markers associated with precursor B cells including RAG gene products. These peripheral Ras/JH-deleted B cell populations show extensive Ig LC gene rearrangement but maintain an extent of kappa LC gene rearrangement and a preference for kappa over lambda LC gene rearrangement similar to that of wild-type B cells. We discuss these findings in the context of potential mechanisms that may regulate Ig LC gene rearrangement.",

    "title": "A murine model of myeloma that allows genetic manipulation of the host microenvironment",
    "abstract": "SUMMARY Multiple myeloma, and the associated osteolytic bone disease, is highly dependent upon cellular interactions within the bone marrow microenvironment. A major limitation of existing myeloma models is the requirement for a specific host strain of mouse, preventing molecular examination of the bone marrow microenvironment. The aim of the current study was to develop a model of myeloma in which the host microenvironment could be modified genetically. The Radl 5T murine model of myeloma is well characterized and closely mimics human myeloma. In the current study, we demonstrate 5T myeloma establishment in recombination activating gene 2 (RAG-2)-deficient mice, which have improper B- and T-cell development. Importantly, these mice can be easily bred with genetically modified mice to generate double knockout mice, allowing manipulation of the host microenvironment at a molecular level. Inoculation of 5TGM1 myeloma cells into RAG-2−/− mice resulted in myeloma development, which was associated with tumor growth within bone and an osteolytic bone disease, as assessed by microcomputed tomography (microCT), histology and histomorphometry. Myeloma-bearing RAG-2−/− mice displayed many features that were similar to both human myeloma and the original Radl 5T model. To demonstrate the use of this model, we have examined the effect of host-derived matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9) in the development of myeloma in vivo. Inoculation of 5TGM1 myeloma cells into mice that are deficient in RAG-2 and MMP-9 resulted in a reduction in both tumor burden and osteolytic bone disease when compared with RAG-2-deficient wild-type myeloma-bearing mice. The establishment of myeloma in RAG-2−/− mice permits molecular examination of the host contribution to myeloma pathogenesis in vivo.",

The values obtained for polyphenols of lower molecular weight, which are not regarded as tannins, were zero or almost zero. An increase of these two values of up to about 1.3-1.4 times with increase of molecular weight of polyphenols (particularly such increase due to galloylation) was observed for each type of tannin tested. The RMBG determination gives values somewhat larger than the RAG values for hydrolyzable tannins, and rather smaller than the RAG values for condensed tannins.",

Five cases were studied by light microscopy and by immunohistochemistry using antibodies to Factor VHI‐related antigen (FVIII‐rAg), ferritin, α1‐antitrypsin, α1‐antichymotrypsin and vimentin and were compared with conventional intravascular organizing thrombi. The results show a similar progression of the immunophenotype of the endothelial cells in both entities: they are initially positive for ferritin, then acquire vimentin positivity and only display FVIII‐rAg positivity in advanced (“mature”) lesions. This suggests that intravascular endothelial hyperplasia is closely related to organizing thrombi and is probably a peculiar form thereof.",

    "abstract": "During thymocyte differentiation, the T cell receptor (TCR)‐β genes are rearranged before the TCR‐α genes. Immature CD4−8− double‐negative thymocytes with a productive rearrangement of the TCR‐β locus are selected to continue maturation to the CD4+8+ double‐positive stage, driven by signals through the pre‐TCR. The signals through the pre‐TCR can be synchronized by injection of mice with anti‐CD3ϵ monoclonal antibody. Using this approach, we demonstrated coordinated induction of a triad of responses in immature thymocytes: arrest of V to DJ rearrangement in the TCR‐β locus, transient down‐regulation of rearrangement‐activating gene (RAG)‐1 and RAG‐2 transcripts, and initiation of germ‐line transcription of the TCR‐α locus. These results suggest that the transition from TCR‐β to TCR‐α locus rearrangement is controlled by signal transduction through the pre‐TCR.",

    "abstract": "Omenn syndrome (OS) is a peculiar, autosomal recessive severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) associated with early-onset, generalized, exudative erythrodermia; lymphoadenopathy; hepato- and splenomegaly; hypereosinophilia; elevated serum IgE; and normal to high activated, yet non-functional, oligoclonal T cells. Recent investigations have shown that the primum movens of all these puzzling features lies in a defect of the lymphoid-specific V(D)J recombination process. Abnormalities in both alleles of either Rag-1 or -2 genes are found in all OS patients. At variance with T B- SCID, whose Rag mutations represent null alleles, OS mutations maintain a residual recombination activity, allowing limited T-cell receptor gene rearrangements to occur in the thymus. The gene rearrangements are subsequently expanded in the periphery after environmental antigen exposure. Missense mutations detected in OS have been examined in a number of biochemical assays and have contributed to dissect the various functional domains of both Rag-1 and Rag-2 proteins. The examination of a set of mutations occurring in the Rag-1 N-terminal portion has demonstrated that this region plays a fundamental role in vivo. The elucidation of the molecular basis of OS has allowed us to perform early prenatal diagnosis and could be the basis for trials of in utero bone marrow transplantation or gene therapy approaches.",

    "title": "Regulation of antibody response in vitro. VII. Enhancing soluble factors for IgG and IgE antibody response.",
    "abstract": "Mesenteric lymph node cells were obtained from rabbits primed with either dinitrophenyl derivatives of Ascaris antigen (DNP-Asc) or Ragweed Fr.D (DNP-Rag) included in aluminum hydroxide gel. The cell suspension was stimulated in vitro with a mixture of a free homologous carrier plus hapten coupled to an unrelated carrier, i.e., DNP-KLH, and anti-hapten antibody response was assessed. Under optimal conditions, the IgG antibody response to the mixture was 2- to 6-fold more than that obtained by DNP-KLH alone. The IgE antibody response was not obtained by stimulation with DNP-KLH alone; however, addition of free carrier to DNP-KLH resulted in a definite IgE antibody response. It was also found that DNP-Asc-primed lymphocytes treated with DNP-KLH were triggered by cell-free supernatant obtained from the culture of DNP-Rag-primed cells activated by free Rag. The results indicated that enhancing soluble factor was released from carrier-specific cells upon stimulation with carrier. The lymph node cells primed with DNP-primary carrier conjugate and a secondary carrier by supplemental immunization showed antihapten antibody response to a mixture of DNP-KLH plus free secondary carrier. In this system, it was found that the enhancing effect of soluble factor correlated with helper function of T cell 2 population specific for secondary carrier. When the carrier-specific cells had helper function for both IgG and IgE antibody responses, stimulation of the cells with free carrier resulted in the release of soluble factors which enhanced both IgG and IgE antibody responses. When helper functions of the carrier-specific cells were limited to the IgG class, however, soluble factor released from the cells enhanced IgG but not IgE antibody response. The results suggested that helper cells for IgG antibody response and those for IgE antibody response release different soluble factors which trigger hapten-primed precursor cells for the respective immunoglobulin class. Evidence was obtained that enhancing soluble factor directly triggers hapten-primed precursor cells rather than carrier-specific helper cells.",

    "abstract": "By modification of the enrichment culture procedure three bacterial strains capable of degrading crude oil in sea water were isolated in pure culture, UP-2, UP-3, and UP-4. Strain UP-2 appears to be highly specialized for growth on crude oil in sea water since it showed strong preference for oil or oil degradation products as substrates for growth, converted 66% of the oil into a form no longer extractable by organic solvents, quantitatively degraded the paraffinic fraction (gas chromatographic analysis), emulsified the oil during exponential growth, and produced 1.6 x 10-8 cells per mg of oil. After exhaustive growth of UP-2 on crude oil the residual oil supported the growth of UP-3 and UP-4, but not a previously isolated oil-degrading bacterium, RAG-1. Strains UP-2, UP-3, and UP-4 grew on RAG-1-degraded oil (specifically depleted of n-alkanes). The growth of UP-3 and UP-4 on UP-2 and RAG-1-degraded oil resulted in the production of new paraffinic compounds as revealed by gas chromatography. When the four strains were grown either together in a mixed culture or sequentially, there was over 75% oil conversion. By plating on selective media, growth of the individual strains was measured kinetically in the reconstituted mixed culture, revealing competition for common growth substances (UP-2 and RAG-1), emhanced die-off (UP-2), and stabilization (UP-4) during the stationary phase.",

    "abstract": "We previously reported that culture of murine fetal liver (FL) cells with interleukin 7 (IL-7) results in expression of high levels of T cell receptor (TCR) gamma transcripts by a population of cells expressing Thy-1 and Pgp-1, suggesting that IL-7 promotes the growth and/or differentiation of pre-T cells. We demonstrate herein that culture of FL cells for 7 d with IL-7 caused the rearrangement and expression of TCR gamma variable (V) region genes V gamma 4 and V gamma 6, but not V gamma 5 or V gamma 7. Since this effect was not blocked by hydroxyurea, it appeared to represent induction of expression of these genes by IL-7 rather than expansion of a preexisting positive population. We also show that IL-7 induced RAG-1 and RAG-2 mRNA expression by FL cells. These data provide evidence that specific TCR gamma/delta V region genes can be rearranged and expressed by T lineage cells before their migration to the thymus, in response to IL-7.",

    "abstract": "Thrombomodulin (TM) is a newly described endothelial cell-associated protein that functions as a potent natural anticoagulant by converting thrombin from a procoagulant protease to an anticoagulant. Various vascular tumors were characterized with immunoperoxidase staining with the use of a polyclonal anti-TM serum. The staining patterns of TM were compared with those of Factor VIII-related antigen (FVIII-RAG) and Ulex europaeus agglutinin-I (UEA-I), which have been used as markers for endothelial cells. The results showed that TM is a specific and a highly sensitive marker for angiosarcomas in comparison with FVIII-RAG or UEA-I. In contrast, UEA-I is more sensitive for benign vascular tumors than TM or FVIII-RAG. The other mesenchymal tumors of nonvascular origin showed negative staining for three endothelial markers. These results indicate that TM is a new specific and sensitive tool for the diagnosis of angiosarcomas.",

    "title": "Characterization of Chromatin Structure and Enhancer Elements for Murine Recombination Activating Gene-21",
    "abstract": "Recombination-activating genes (RAGs) play a critical role in V(D)J recombination machinery and their expression is specifically regulated during lymphocyte ontogeny. To elucidate the molecular mechanisms regulating murine RAG-2 expression, we examined a chromatin structure of 25-kb DNA segment adjacent to murine RAG-2 by analyzing DNase I hypersensitive (HS) sites. In a RAG-2-expressing murine pre-B cell line, three lymphoid cell-specific HS sites (HS1, HS2, and HS3) were identified. Among these HS sites, one HS site (HS3) that locates in the RAG-2 promoter was associated only with RAG-2-expressing cell lines. Using the transient enhanced green fluorescence protein reporter gene assays, we identified two enhancer elements in the 5′-upstream region of RAG-2 that corresponded to HS1 and HS2. One of the enhancer elements (D3) exhibited enhancer activity only in the lymphoid cell lines. Analysis of the transgenic mice carrying the enhanced green fluorescence protein-reporter gene linked with D3 revealed that D3 activated the reporter gene-expression in the primary lymphoid tissues, but not in the secondary lymphoid tissues or nonlymphoid tissues. D3 was active in CD4−CD8−, but not in CD4+CD8+ or CD4+CD8− thymocytes in the thymus, and also active in B220+IgM−, but not in B220+IgM+, cells in the bone marrow. Finally, our data suggested that C/EBP may bind to the D3 enhancer and function as one of the transcription factor(s) responsible for the enhancer activity. These results show that the tissue- and stage-specific expression of murine RAG-2 is regulated by alteration of the chromatin structure as well as cis-regulatory enhancer elements.",

    "title": "Genetic Control of Experimental Lyme Arthritis in the Absence of Specific Immunity",
    "abstract": "ABSTRACT Host genetics play an important role in determining resistance or susceptibility to experimental Lyme arthritis. While specific immunity appears to regulate disease resolution, innate immunity appears to regulate disease severity. Intradermal infection with Borrelia burgdorferi yields severe arthritis in C3H/He (C3H) mice but only minimal arthritis in BALB/c mice. Intradermal infection of immunodeficient C3H SCID mice also results in severe arthritis, but arthritis of only moderate severity in BALB/c SCID mice. In the present study, we examined immunodeficient recombinase-activating gene-knockout (RAG-1−/−) (RAG−) mice from resistant C57BL/6 (B6) and DBA/2 (DBA) mouse strains. B. burgdorferi-infected B6 RAG− and DBA RAG− mice had little or no ankle swelling, a low occurrence of inflammatory infiltrates in tibiotarsal joints, and low arthritis severity scores in comparison to RAG+ and RAG− BALB/c or C3H mice. Few differences in spirochete DNA levels in ankles of resistant and susceptible RAG− mice were seen. These data suggest that resistance to arthritis development following B. burgdorferi infection is not necessarily dependent on an acquired immune response and can occur despite the presence of high spirochete burden. Thus, genes expressed outside the specific immune response can be central regulators of experimental arthritis.",

    "abstract": "Initial processing of Athabasca oil sands obtained from the water-based extraction process yields stable water-in-bitumen emulsions. When the bitumen is diluted with naphtha to reduce its viscosity and density, partial separation can be obtained with a suitable demulsifier. However, a “rag layer” forms between the clean oil and free water layers. The partially oil-wet kaolinite in clay solids can retard water-in-oil emulsion coalescence, entrap oil drops, and form aggregates, which results in a rag layer in the middle of the sample. Once formed, this rag layer prevents further coalescence and water separation. We show here that wettability of kaolinite can be characterized via ζ potential measurement and modeling. A simplified Gouy−Stern−Grahame model and an oxide site binding model can be used to correlate the ζ potential of kaolinite in brine with different additives. Sodium silicate has the greatest effect per unit addition on changing the ζ potential of kaolinite and can be used to change the wettabil...",

    "abstract": "We have identified two functional domains on the von Willebrand factor (VWF) moiety of the Factor VIII-von Willebrand factor complex (FVIII-VWF), one interacting with blood platelets, and one interacting with vessel wall collagens, by means of two monoclonal antibodies directed against the VWF molecule, CLB-RAg 35 and CLB-RAg 201. The monoclonal antibody CLB-RAg 35 inhibited virtually all platelet adherence to artery subendothelium and to purified vessel wall collagen type III, at relatively high wall shear rates. CLB-RAg 35 also inhibited the ristocetin-induced platelet aggregation and the binding of FVIII-VWF to the platelet in the presence of ristocetin but did not affect the binding of FVIII-VWF to collagen. The monoclonal antibody CLB-RAg 201 inhibited the binding of FVIII-VWF to purified vessel wall collagen type I and III and all platelet adherence to collagen type III and the platelet adherence to subendothelium that was mediated by FVIII-VWF in plasma. The two functional domains on FVIII-VWF that were recognized by CLB-RAg 35 and CLB-RAg 201 were identified by means of immunoprecipitation studies of trypsin-digested FVIII-VWF. The domains resided on different polypeptide fragments, with a Mr of 48,000 for the collagen binding domain and a Mr of 116,000 for the platelet binding domain. The 116,000-mol wt fragment consisted of subunits of 52,000/56,000 mol wt and 14,000 mol wt after reduction. The 52,000/56,000-mol wt subunits possessed the epitope for CLB-RAg 35.",

    "abstract": "IL-7 is a stromal cell-derived cytokine with a well-established physiologic role in lymphocyte biology. This report describes an unexpected role for IL-7 in the development of colitis in a T and B cell-deficient environment. Recombination-activating gene-2 (RAG-2)-deficient mice (RAG-2(-/-)) were exposed to and subsequently maintained a horizontally transmitted microbial flora that included Helicobacter hepaticus. These animals mounted a strong myeloid cell response and developed both systemic and local signs of a severe colitis. A striking infiltration of F4/80 and MHC class II-positive cells was seen in the colon and cecum of animals undergoing the disease. Mice mutant for both IL-7 and RAG-2 (IL-7/RAG-2(-/-)) that were colonized by the same flora showed no signs of myeloid responses or colitis, indicating that IL-7 plays a critical role in exacerbating a non-T cell/non-B cell-mediated chronic inflammatory response. Recombinant IL-10 protein therapy was able to prevent the occurrence of colitis in susceptible mice, suggesting a pivotal role for macrophages. The implications of a role for IL-7 in this disease model with respect to human inflammatory bowel disease are discussed.",

    "abstract": "Th17 cells and Th1 cells coordinate to play a critical role in the formation of inflammatory bowel diseases. To examine how Th17 and Th1 cells are regulated at inflammatory sites, we used Th1‐dominant CD4+CD45RBhigh T cell‐transferred RAG‐2−/− and Th1/Th17‐mixed IL‐10−/− mice. Interestingly, not only did colitic RAG‐2−/− mice that were parabiosed with WT mice show significant amelioration of colitis, but amelioration of disease was also observed in those parabiosed with colitic IL‐10−/− mice. To assess the interference between Th1 and Th17 colitogenic T cells, we co‐transferred colitogenic CD4+ T cells from the lamina propria (LP) of CD4+CD45RBhigh T cell‐transferred RAG‐2−/− mice and IL‐10−/− mice into RAG‐2−/− mice. Surprisingly, the co‐transferred RAG‐2−/− mice showed a vast cellular infiltration of LP CD4+ T cells similar to that seen in RAG‐2−/− mice re‐transferred with the cells from colitic RAG‐2−/− mice alone, but the co‐transferred RAG‐2−/− mice did not have the wasting symptoms, which are also absent in RAG‐2−/− mice transferred with cells from colitic IL‐10−/− mice alone. Furthermore, the percentages of Th1 and Th17 cells originating from IL‐10−/− mice and those of Th1 cells originating from colitic RAG‐2−/− mice were all significantly decreased in the co‐transferred mice as compared with the singly‐transferred paired RAG‐2−/− mice, suggesting that Th1 and Th17 cells are in competition, and that their orchestration results in a merged clinical phenotype of the two types of murine colitis.",

    "title": "Bystander activation of CD4+ T cells accounts for herpetic ocular lesions.",
    "abstract": "PURPOSE\nStromal keratitis is an immunopathologic consequence of herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection of the cornea. The lesion is immunopathologic, but the identities of molecules that drive the reaction remain unresolved. To exclude viral antigen recognition as a necessary step in the disease process, ocular HSV infection was followed in Tg-RAG mice (OVA-TCR transgenic mice crossed to RAG2-deficient mice) whose limited T-cell repertoire did not include immune responsiveness to HSV.\n\n\nMETHODS\nMice with T-cell specificity to OVA peptide (Tg-RAG mice) as well as control DO11.10 and BALB/c mice were infected with HSV on the scarified cornea and subjected to clinical, histologic, and immunologic analysis. To evaluate involvement of OVA-specific CD4+ T cells in lesion development in Tg-RAG mice, monoclonal antibody to CD4+ T cells was used for in vivo CD4+ T-cell depletion.\n\n\nRESULTS\nTg-RAG mice were capable of eliciting ocular lesions in the absence of detectable reactivity to viral antigens. Lesion manifestation in Tg-RAG mice was CD4+ T-cell dependent and the cellular infiltrates and their inflammatory products in the HSV-infected cornea were comparable to similarly infected BALB/c and DO11.10 mice.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe authors conclude that mechanisms other than viral antigen recognition, and hence molecular mimicry, are at play and are sufficient to cause HSV-induced stromal keratitis. The data imply a significant role for non-virus-specific CD4+ T cells that could become activated by an inflammatory milieu consisting of enhanced accessory molecules and proinflammatory cytokines in the cornea.",

    "title": "Function of the pre-T-cell receptor alpha chain in T-cell development and allelic exclusion at the T-cell receptor beta locus.",
    "abstract": "The pre-T-cell receptor, composed of the T-cell receptor (TCR) beta chain (TCRbeta), pre-Talpha (pTalpha) chain, and CD3 molecules, has been postulated to be a transducer of signals during the early stages of T-cell development. To examine the function of the transmembrane pTalpha chain during tbymocyte development, we generated pTalpha-/- embryonic stem cells and assayed their ability to differentiate into lymphoid cells in vivo after injection into recombination-activating gene (RAG)-2-deficient blastocysts. Thymocytes representing all stages of T-cell differentiation were detected in the thymus of pTalpha-/- chimeric mice, indicating that thymocyte development can occur without pTalpha. However, greatly reduced thymocyte numbers and substantially increased percentages of both CD4-CD8- thymocytes and TCRgammadelta+ thymocytes suggest that pTalpha plays a critical role in thymocyte expansion. To investigate the role of the pTalpha chain in allelic exclusion at the TCRbeta locus, a functionally rearranged TCRbeta minigene was introduced into pTalpha-/- and pTalpha+/- embryonic stem cells, which were subsequently assayed by RAG-2-deficient blastocyst complementation. In the absence of pTalpha, expression of the transgenic TCRbeta inhibited rearrangement of the endogenous TCRbeta locus to an extent similar to that seen in normal TCRbeta transgenic mice, suggesting that pTalpha may not be required for signaling allelic exclusion at the TCRbeta locus.",

    "title": "ATP-dependent Remodeling by SWI/SNF and ISWI Proteins Stimulates V(D)J Cleavage of 5 S Arrays*",
    "abstract": "Control of V(D)J recombination is critical for the generation of a fully developed immune repertoire. The molecular mechanisms underlying the regulation of antigen receptor gene assembly are beginning to be revealed. Here we studied the influence of chromatin modifications on V(D)J cleavage of a polynucleosomal substrate, in which V(D)J cleavage is greatly reduced compared with naked DNA. ATP-dependent remodeling by human SWI/SNF (hSWI/SNF) in the presence of HMG1 led to a substantial increase of cleavage by the recombination activation gene (RAG) proteins. Either BRG1, the ATPase subunit of hSWI/SNF, or SNF2h, the ATPase of human ISWI complexes, was capable of stimulating V(D)J cleavage of the array, although these remodelers act by different mechanisms. No effect of histone hyperacetylation was detectable in this system. As is observed on naked DNA, in the presence of core RAG1, the full-length RAG2 protein proved to be more active than core RAG2 on these polynucleosomal arrays, reinforcing the importance of the RAG2 C-terminal domain for efficient recombination. Comparison of 5 S array cleavage by the RAG proteins or by the restriction enzyme HhaI after remodeling by hSWI/SNF suggested that RAG proteins and HhaI might have different requirements for maximal accessibility of the substrate.",

    "abstract": "The cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors are key regulators of cell cycle progression. Although implicated in carcinogenesis, they inhibit the proliferation of a variety of normal cell types, and their role in diverse human diseases is not fully understood. Here, we report that p27(Kip1) plays a major role in cardiovascular disease through its effects on the proliferation of bone marrow-derived (BM-derived) immune cells that migrate into vascular lesions. Lesion formation after mechanical arterial injury was markedly increased in mice with homozygous deletion of p27(Kip1), characterized by prominent vascular infiltration by immune and inflammatory cells. Vascular occlusion was substantially increased when BM-derived cells from p27(-/-) mice repopulated vascular lesions induced by mechanical injury in p27(+/+) recipients, in contrast to p27(+/+) BM donors. To determine the contribution of immune cells to vascular injury, transplantation was performed with BM derived from RAG(-/-) and RAG(+/+) mice. RAG(+/+) BM markedly exacerbated vascular proliferative lesions compared with what was found in RAG(-/-) donors. Taken together, these findings suggest that vascular repair and regeneration is regulated by the proliferation of BM-derived hematopoietic and nonhematopoietic cells through a p27(Kip1)-dependent mechanism and that immune cells largely mediate these effects.",

    "abstract": "Antigen‐presenting cells (APC), including dendritic cells and macrophages, produce a large amount of interferon (IFN)‐γ, a crucial cytokine for the control of infectious diseases. To elucidate the role of IFN‐γ from APC in vivo, we employed cytokine receptor common γ subunit (γc) and recombination‐activating gene (Rag)‐2 double‐knockout (γc–/–(y)‐Rag‐2–/–) mice, which are severely impaired in IFN‐γ production and are extremely susceptible to infection of intracellular pathogens including Listeria monocytogenes and Toxoplasma gondii. Adoptive transfer of IFN‐γ‐producing APC increased levels of serum IFN‐γ and the resistance to Listeria. Although depletion of NK cells from Rag‐2–/– mice slightly increased the susceptibility to bacterial infection, they are substantially more resistant than γc–/–(y)‐Rag‐2–/– mice, which are also devoid of all lymphoid cells. These results demonstrate that the APC‐derived IFN‐γ contributes to the control of infectious agents in vivo.",

    "abstract": "When exponentially growing cultures of Acinetobacter calcoaceticus RAG-1 or RAG-92 were either treated with inhibitors of protein synthesis or starved for a required amino acid, there was a stimulation in the production of emulsan, an extracellular polyanionic emulsifier. Emulsan synthesis in the presence of chloramphenicol was dependent on utilizable sources of carbon and nitrogen and was inhibited by cyanide or azide or anaerobic conditions. Radioactive tracer experiments indicated that the enhanced production of emulsan after the addition of chloramphenicol was due to both the release of material synthesized before the addition of the antibiotic (40%) and de novo synthesis of the polymer (60%). Chemical analysis of RAG-1 cells demonstrated large amounts of polymeric amino sugars; it was estimated that cell-associated emulsan comprised about 15% of the dry weight of growing cells. The data are consistent with the hypothesis that a polymeric precursor of emulsan accumulates on the cell surface during the exponential growth phase; in the stationary phase or during inhibition of protein synthesis, the polymer is released as a potent emulsifier.",

The enzyme catalyzed the hydrolysis of acetyl and other acyl groups from triglycerides and aryl and alkyl esters. Emulsan, the extracellular heteropolysaccharide bioemulsifier produced by strain RAG-1, was also a substrate for the enzyme. Gel filtration showed that the cell-free enzyme was released from the cell surface either emulsan free or associated with the bioemulsifier. The partially purified enzyme was found to interact specifically with the esterified fully active emulsan, but not with the deesterified polymer. A role for esterase in emulsan release from the cell surface was indicated when the enzyme was preferentially depleted from the cell surface under conditions in which emulsan was not released. Such cells lost the capacity to release the biopolymer.",

This process proceeds through two distinct phases: a cleavage phase in which the RAG1 and RAG2 proteins introduce DNA double-strand breaks at antigen receptor gene segments, and a joining phase in which the resulting DNA breaks are processed and repaired via the non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) repair pathway. Genetic and biochemical evidence suggest that the RAG proteins play an active role in guiding the repair of DNA breaks introduced during V(D)J recombination to the NHEJ pathway. However, evidence for specific association between the RAG proteins and any of the factors involved in NHEJ remains elusive. Here we present evidence that two components of the NHEJ pathway, Ku70 and Ku80, interact with full-length RAG1, providing a biochemical link between the two phases of V(D)J recombination.",

Both 13-cis-RAG and all-trans-RAG have been identified as major plasma metabolites in these studies using thermospray/HPLC/mass-spectrometry of the intact conjugates. AUC comparisons from 0-24 hr after administration indicated that 13-cis-RA treatment resulted in primarily cis metabolites and all-trans-RA treatment resulted in primarily trans metabolites, although low levels of isomerization products were observed. Comparison of the two doses (2 and 10 mg/kg, po) revealed that the AUCs were proportional to the dose administered. Although qualitatively similar, elimination of 13-cis-RA in the monkey was more rapid than in the human, and approximately a 10-fold greater dose of 13-cis-RA was required in the monkey to produce the AUC values comparable to the human. The elimination of all-trans-RA in monkey was faster than that of 13-cis-RA and tended to increase with repeated dosing.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "title": "Sublethal gamma-radiation induces differentiation of CD4-/CD8- into CD4+/CD8+ thymocytes without T cell receptor beta rearrangement in recombinase activation gene 2-/- mice",
    "abstract": "DNA recombination of the immunoglobulin (Ig) or T cell receptor (TCR) gene loci is an essential step in the production of lymphocytes bearing antigen-specific receptors. Mice that lack the ability to rearrange their Ig and TCR gene loci are devoid of mature B and T cells. Complete rearrangement and expression of the TCR-beta chain has been suggested to allow immature thymocytes to switch from the CD4-/CD8- to the CD4+/CD8+ stage of thymic development. Thus, thymocytes from severe combined immune deficient (SCID) mice or mice deficient in recombinase activation genes (RAG), which do not undergo proper DNA rearrangement, are arrested at the early CD4-/CD8- stage of development. B cell precursors in SCID or RAG mice do not progress from the B220+/sIgM- /heat stable antigen (HSA)+/CD43+ to the B220+/sIgM-/HSA+/CD43- stage. In an attempt to reconstitute RAG-2-/- mice with bone marrow- or fetal liver-derived progenitor cells, we subjected these mice to sublethal doses of gamma-radiation. It is surprising that in the absence of donor cells, irradiated RAG-2-/- mice revealed a dramatic change in their lymphoid phenotype. 14 d after irradiation, the majority of thymocytes had advanced to the CD4+/CD8+ stage of T cell development and a small number of bone marrow precursors had progressed to the CD43-, HSAhi stage of B cell development. Analysis of the resulting CD4+/CD8+ thymocytes revealed no surface expression of the TCR/CD3 complex and no V-D-J rearrangement of the TCR-beta gene locus. Our findings provide evidence for a novel pathway that allows the transition of thymocytes from the CD4-/CD8- to the CD4+/CD8+ stage and that does not appear to require TCR-beta chain rearrangement.",

    "abstract": "The variability of Kluyveromyces lactis strains in sensitivity to glucose is correlated with genetic differences in Kluyveromyces hexose transporter (KHT) genes. The glucose sensitive strain JA6 was shown to contain an additional gene, KHT2, not found in strains that are less sensitive. KHT2 is tandemly arranged with KHT1 which is identical to the low-affinity transporter gene RAG1, except for the C-terminus. Sequence analysis indicated that most of KHT2 had been lost by a recombination event between KHT1 and KHT2 generating the chimeric gene RAG1. Recombination between KHT1 and KHT2 was also found in mutants of JA6 selected as 2-deoxyglucose resistant colonies. These mutants, like kht1 kht2 double mutants were unable to grow on glucose when respiration was blocked (Rag- phenotype) and glucose repression was strongly reduced. kht1 or kht2 single mutants of JA6 were Rag+ but still an influence of the kht mutations on glucose repression was detectable. Repression was not affected in a Rag- mutant deleted for the phosphoglucose isomerase gene suggesting that the influence of transporter genes on repression is not caused by a reduction of the glycolytic flux. The data rather suggest that sensitivity to glucose repression is dependent on the rate of glucose uptake.",

    "abstract": "The epithelial component of the thymic environment is organized into discrete cortical and medullary compartments that mediate different aspects of thymocyte differentiation. The processes controlling the growth and organization of these epithelial compartments are poorly defined. In this study we have used a novel approach to define the three-dimensional organization of thymic epithelial (TE) compartments to demonstrate that the organization of the medullary TE compartment is very complex. A spatial relationship of medullary thymic epithelium with vascular elements of the thymus was demonstrated by simultaneous immunohistochemical labeling of vascular elements and medullary TE. Medullary TE was often arranged as perivascular cuffs surrounding intermediate-sized vessels, but was not associated with either the capillary network or large centrally located vessels. Similar analyses of RAG-2(-/-) thymi revealed a striking physical association of medullary TE with vascular elements. Ultrastructural analysis of the RAG-2(-/-) thymus indicated a preferential association of focal accumulations of medullary TE with post-capillary venules. These data suggest that discrete segments of the thymic vasculature provide cues that act in concert with thymocyte-derived stimuli to effect normal development of the thymic environment.",

We show that thymocyte development in these mice can be reconstituted by the introduction of a transgenic T cell receptor (TCR), implying that one function of the IL‐7Rα chain is to initiate TCR gene rearrangement. Expression of the recombinase‐activating genes RAG1 and RAG2 was greatly reduced in the IL‐7Rα‐/‐ thymuses, and in DN thymocytes from the TCR transgenic IL‐7Rα‐/‐ mice, but was restored in double‐positive thymocytes from the TCR transgenic IL‐7Rα‐/‐ mice. These data suggest that the IL‐7Rα chain controls RAG expression and initiation of TCRβ chain VDJ rearrangement in DN cells. In contrast, once cells have progressed beyond the DN stage of development the IL‐7Rα chain becomes no longer essential for RAG expression.",

    "title": "Maturation of B cell precursors is impaired in thymic-deprived nude and old mice.",
    "abstract": "We have previously reported that bone marrow B cell precursors from thymic-deprived nude and old mice express less recombination-activating gene-1 (RAG-1) mRNA than they do in young euthymic mice. We now report that both nude and old mice have decreased bone marrow pre-B cells and that fewer pre-B cells express RAG protein. This combination of events appears to be the basis for the lower level of bone marrow RAG mRNA in thymic-deprived mice. A link between thymic function and B cell development was suggested by the similar kinetics of thymic involution and of declining bone marrow RAG-1 gene expression during aging. Support for this hypothesis was obtained by demonstrating that injection of supernatant medium from activated CD8+ but not CD4+ young T cells from mice increases RAG mRNA, RAG protein, and the number of bone marrow pre-B cells in nude and old mice. Furthermore, in vivo CD8+ T cells also regulate bone marrow RAG gene expression. Thus, mice deficient in CD8+ T cells expressed levels of RAG-1 mRNA in their bone marrow that were only 10% of those observed in normal or CD4+ T cell-deficient mice. IL-16 was detected in the supernatant medium from activated T cell cultures, and injection of nanogram quantities of recombinant IL-16 (rIL-16) into nude or old mice increased the levels of RAG mRNA in bone marrow B cell precursors and the number of bone marrow pre-B cells. We conclude that the impaired development of B cells within the bone marrow of thymic-deprived nude and old mice can be reversed, at least in part, by the administration of rIL-16.",

    "title": "Neurobehavioral Changes Resulting from Recombinase Activation Gene 1 Deletion",
    "abstract": "ABSTRACT Recombinase activation gene 1 (RAG-1) function is essential for V(D)J recombination in T-cell-receptor and immunoglobulin rearrangements whereby the immune system may encode memories of a vast array of antigens. The RAG-1 gene is also localized to neurons in the hippocampal formation and related limbic regions that are involved in spatial learning and memory as well as other parameters of neurobehavioral performance. Since the unique ability to encode memory is shared by the immune system and the brain, we tested the hypothesis that loss of the RAG-1 gene in the brain would influence learning and memory performance and examined several different domains of behavior in RAG-1-knockout and control mice. Compared to control mice, RAG-1-knockout mice exhibited increased locomotor activity in an open field under both dim and bright lighting conditions and decreased habituation (reduction in the expected decline in locomotor activity with increasing familiarity with the novel environment in a 1-h test session) in bright lighting. RAG-1-knockout mice also showed reduced levels of fearfulness for some measures of fear-motivated behavior in both the open-field behavior test and elevated-plus maze test. Contrary to our hypothesis, no differences in spatial learning and memory were found between the groups, although modest differences were observed visible-platform testing in the Morris water maze. Neither prepulse inhibition, a measure of sensorimotor gating, nor reflexive acoustic startle responses differed between the RAG-1-knockout and control mice. It remains to be determined if these changes are due to the loss of RAG-1 gene expression in the brain, are due to the absence of the gene in the immune system (e.g., the loss of cytokines with neuromodulatory activities), or are due to some combination of both effects. Study of the neurobiological actions of RAG-1 in the brain may provide new insights into important processes involved in normal brain function and disease.",

    "title": "Mechanistic Basis for Coding End Sequence Effects in the Initiation of V(D)J Recombination",
    "abstract": "ABSTRACT V(D)J recombination is directed by recombination signal sequences. However, the flanking coding end sequence can markedly affect the frequency of the initiation of V(D)J recombination in vivo. Here we demonstrate that the coding end sequence effect can be qualitatively and quantitatively recapitulated in vitro with purified RAG proteins. We find that coding end sequence specifically affects the nicking step, which is the first biochemical step in RAG-mediated cleavage. The subsequent hairpin formation step is not affected by the coding end sequence. Furthermore, the coding end sequence effect can be ablated by prenicking the substrate, indicating that the coding end effect is specific to the nicking step. In reactions in which both 12- and 23-substrates are present, a suboptimal coding end sequence on one signal can slow down hairpin formation at the partner signal, a result consistent with models in which coordination between the signals occurs at the hairpin formation step. The coding end sequence effect on nicking and the coupling of the 12- and 23-substrates explains how hairpin formation can be rate limiting for some 12/23 pairs, whereas nicking can be rate limiting when low-efficiency coding end sequences are involved.",

    "title": "A non-B DNA can replace heptamer of V(D)J recombination when present along with a nonamer: implications in chromosomal translocations and cancer.",
    "abstract": "The RAG (recombination-activating gene) complex is responsible for the generation of antigen receptor diversity by acting as a sequence-specific nuclease. Recent studies have shown that it also acts as a structure-specific nuclease. However, little is known about the factors regulating this activity at the genomic level. We show in the present study that the proximity of a V(D)J nonamer to heteroduplex DNA significantly increases RAG cleavage and binding efficiencies at physiological concentrations of MgCl(2). The position of the nonamer with respect to heteroduplex DNA was important, but not orientation. A spacer length of 18 bp between the nonamer and mismatch was optimal for RAG-mediated DNA cleavage. Mutations to the sequence of the nonamer and deletion of the nonamer-binding domain of RAG1 reinforced the role of the nonamer in the enhancement in RAG cleavage. Interestingly, partial mutation of the nonamer did not significantly reduce RAG cleavage on heteroduplex DNA, suggesting that even cryptic nonamers were sufficient to enhance RAG cleavage. More importantly, we show that the fragile region involved in chromosomal translocations associated with BCL2 (B-cell lymphoma 2) can be cleaved by RAGs following a nonamer-dependent mechanism. Hence our results from the present study suggest that a non-B DNA can replace the heptamer of RSS (recombination signal sequence) when present adjacent to nonamers, explaining the generation of certain chromosomal translocations in lymphoid malignancies.",

CLB-RAg 201, an MAb against von Willebrand factor, completely inhibits the binding of von Willebrand factor to collagen type I and type III. CLB-RAg 201 does not inhibit the binding of 125I-von Willebrand factor to extracellular matrices of endothelial cells, to smooth muscle cells, or to the subendothelium. CLB-RAg 201 partly inhibits platelet adhesion to these surfaces, but this directly affects the interaction between von Willebrand factor and platelets and is not due to inhibition of binding of von Willebrand factor to these surfaces. Another MAb, CLB-RAg 38, does not inhibit the binding of von Willebrand factor to collagen. CLB-RAg 38 completely inhibits the binding of von Willebrand factor to extracellular matrices. CLB-RAg 38 inhibits platelet adhesion to cellular matrices completely insofar as it is dependent on plasma von Willebrand factor. CLB-RAg 38 does not inhibit the total binding of von Willebrand factor to subendothelium, as there are too many different binding sites, but it completely inhibits the functional binding sites for von Willebrand factor that support platelet adhesion. The epitopes for CLB-RAg 38 and 201 on the von Willebrand factor molecule are located on different fragments of the molecule. These results indicate that von Willebrand factor binds to subendothelium and matrices of cultured cells by a mechanism that is different from that by which it binds to collagen.",

    "abstract": "To examine the role of light chains in early B cell development we combined RAG-1 and lambda 5 mutations to produce mice that expressed neither conventional nor surrogate light chains (RAG-1-/-, lambda 5-/- ). Unique heavy and light chain genes were then introduced into the double and single mutant backgrounds. Membrane immunoglobulin (Ig)mu (mIg mu) associated with Ig alpha-Ig beta but was unable to activate the pre-B cell transition in RAG-1-/-lambda 5-/- mice. Either lambda 5 or kappa light chains were sufficient to complement this deficiency. Therefore light chains are absolutely required for a functional Ig signaling module in early B cell development. Our data provide direct evidence for the existence of two pathways for induction of early B cell development: one which is activated through surrogate light chains and mIg mu, and an alternative pathway which uses conventional light chains and mIg mu.",

    "title": "Role of T Lymphocytes in Angiotensin II–Mediated Microvascular Thrombosis",
    "abstract": "Clinical trials and animal studies have revealed a role for the renin-angiotensin system in the enhanced thrombus development that is associated with hypertension. Because T lymphocytes have been implicated in the vascular dysfunction and blood pressure elevation associated with increased angiotensin II (Ang II) levels, we evaluated the role of the adaptive immune system in mediating the enhanced thrombosis during Ang II–induced hypertension. Light/dye-induced thrombosis was induced in cremaster arterioles of wild-type, immunodeficient Rag-1−/−, CD8+, or CD4+ lymphocyte-deficient and NADPH oxidase (gp91phox)–deficient mice implanted with an Ang II–loaded pump for 2 weeks. Chronic Ang II infusion enhanced arteriolar thrombosis in wild-type mice but not in Rag-1−/−, CD4+ T-cell–deficient, or gp91phox−/− mice. CD8+ T-cell−/− mice exhibited partial protection. Adoptive transfer of T cells derived from wild-type or gp91phox−/− mice into Rag-1−/− restored the prothrombotic phenotype induced by Ang II. T lymphocytes (CD4+ and, to a lesser extent, CD8+) play a major role in mediating the accelerated microvascular thrombosis associated with Ang II–induced hypertension. NADPH oxidase–derived reactive oxygen species, produced by cells other than T lymphocytes, also appear critical for the Ang II–enhanced, T cell–dependent thrombosis response.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND & AIMS\nLigation of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptors (TNFRs) with TNF plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of human inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). However, it remains unclear which cell types activated through TNFR-associated signaling cascades are involved in the pathogenesis of colitis.\n\n\nMETHODS\nRecombination activating gene-1 (RAG) knockout (KO) (no T or B cells)-based TNFR double and triple KO mice were generated. Bone marrow (BM) chimera mice in which BM-derived myeloid cells, but not colonic epithelial cells (CECs), express TNFRs were also generated. Colitis was induced by administration of dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) in distilled water. Murine lines and chimeras were assessed for disease severity, histopathology, apoptotic cell rate, epithelial proliferation, and bacterial invasion rate.\n\n\nRESULTS\nFollowing DSS administration, mice lacking both RAG and TNFR1 exhibited a high mortality (>80%) rate with an impaired CEC regeneration compared with RAG KO and RAG x TNFR2 double KO (DKO) mice. Transplantation of RAG KO-derived BM cells restored CEC regeneration and rescued the majority of recipient RAG x TNFR1 DKO mice from DSS-induced mortality. After BM transplantation, RAG x TNFR1 DKO mice exhibited an increased rate of apoptosis in the colonic lamina propria macrophages in association with the activation of caspases. In addition, BM reconstitution directly or indirectly enhanced the proliferation of CECs by activating mitogen-activated protein kinase and phosphoinositide-3 kinase/Akt pathways.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nTNFR1-signaling cascade in colonic myeloid lineage cells contributes to the suppression of acute damage-associated mortality presumably by controlling CEC homeostasis.",

    "abstract": "To examine the function of CD2 in vivo, N15 TCR transgenic (tg) RAG-2−/− H-2b mice bearing a single TCR specific for the vesicular stomatitis virus octapeptide bound to the H-2Kb molecule were compared on a wild-type or CD2−/− background. In N15tg RAG-2−/− CD2−/− mice, thymic dysfunction is evident by 6 wk with a pre-TCR block in the CD4−CD8− double-negative thymocytes at the CD25+CD44− stage. Moreover, mature N15tg RAG-2−/− CD2−/− T cells are ∼100-fold less responsive to vesicular stomatitis virus octapeptide and unresponsive to weak peptide agonists, as judged by IFN-γ production. Repertoire analysis shows substantial differences in Vα usage between non-tg C57BL/6 (B6) and B6 CD2−/− mice. Collectively, these findings show that CD2 plays a role in pre-TCR function in double-negative thymocytes, TCR selection events during thymocyte development, and TCR-stimulated cytokine production in mature T cells.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nB cells that accumulate in the synovial tissue of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients revise their receptors due to coordinate expression of recombination-activating gene 1 (RAG-1) and RAG-2 genes. The aim of this study was to determine the mechanisms that control this re-expression.\n\n\nMETHODS\nB cells from healthy control subjects were cocultured with fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS) from patients with RA and osteoarthritis (OA). Re-expression of RAG messenger RNA (mRNA) and proteins was analyzed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and indirect immunofluorescence. Activity of RAG enzymes was evaluated by flow cytometry to measure variations in immunoglobulin kappa and lambda light chain expression and by ligation-mediated-PCR to assess specific DNA breaks. Blocking antibodies, short hairpin RNA, and recombinant cytokine were used to identify the molecules involved in RAG re-expression.\n\n\nRESULTS\nRA FLS, but not OA FLS, induced B cells to re-express RAG mRNA and proteins. Enzymes were functional, since the kappa-to-lambda ratios decreased and specific DNA breaks were detectable after coculture with RA FLS. Transmembrane BAFF provided the first signal of RAG re-expression, since its down-regulation in RA FLS prevented RAG gene transcription in B cells. The failure of transmembrane BAFF from OA FLS to induce RAG suggests that a second signal was provided by RA FLS. Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is a candidate, since blockade of its receptors precluded transcription of RAG genes by RA FLS. Unless supplemented with IL-6, OA FLS were unable to induce RAG gene expression in normal B cells.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nTwo independent signals are required for the induction of RAG gene expression in B cells that infiltrate the synovium of patients with RA.",

    "abstract": "North Indian rāg performance, especially as practised in intimate and informal settings, is often distinguished by a lively interaction involving both musicians and listeners, mediated by gestures and vocal interjections. Performers gesture to each other, to the audience, and expressively with the music, and audiences become part of that process. The premise of this study is that observing the behaviour of audience members, as well as that of performers, should provide a valuable window onto the ways in which rāg performance is experienced by all of its participants. The main questions I aim to elucidate in this paper are: What does observable behaviour tell us about the way people experience the metrical and formal structures of a rāg performance? When and how do listeners become involved in the performance gesturally and/or verbally? I shall address these and related questions through an analysis of a khyāl performance by Vijay Koparkar recorded in Mumbai in 2005. Detailed analysis of this performance indicates that these questions can indeed be answered using observational methods, and also suggests other important issues that may not have done been raised had this approach not been adopted.",

    "abstract": "Tumour necrosis factor (TNF) is critical for sustained protective immunity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection. To investigate the relative contributions of macrophage‐ and T cell‐derived TNF towards  this immunity T cells from wild‐type (WT) or TNF–/– mice were transferred into RAG–/– or TNF–/– mice which were then infected with M. tuberculosis. Infected RAG–/– mice and RAG–/– recipients of TNF deficient T cells developed overwhelming infection, with extensive pulmonary and hepatic necrosis and succumbed with a median of only 16 days infection. By contrast, RAG–/– recipients of WT T cells showed a significant increase in survival with a median of 32 days. Although initial bacterial growth was similar in all groups of RAG–/– mice, the transfer of WT, but not TNF–/–, T cells led to the formation of discrete foci of leucocytes and macrophages and delayed the development of necrotizing pathology. To determine requirements for macrophage‐derived TNF, WT or TNF–/– T cells were transferred into TNF–/– mice at the time of M. tuberculosis infection. Transfer of WT T cells significantly prolonged survival and reduced the early tissue necrosis evident in the TNF–/– mice, however, these mice eventually succumbed indicating that T cell‐derived TNF alone is insufficient to control the infection. Therefore, both T cell‐ and macrophage‐derived TNF play distinct roles in orchestrating the protective inflammatory response and enhancing survival during M. tuberculosis infection.",

    "abstract": "It has long been accepted that immunoglobulins (Igs) were produced by B lymphoid cells only. Recently Igs have been found to be expressed in various human cancer cells and promote tumor growth. Recombination activating gene 1 (RAG1) and RAG2, which are essential enzymes for initiating variable-diversity-joining segment recombination, have also been found to be expressed in cancer cells. However, the mechanism of RAG activation in these cancer cells has not been elucidated. Here, we investigated the regulatory mechanism of RAG expression in four human cancer cell lines by analyzing transcription factors that induce RAG activation in B cells. By RT-PCR, Western blot and immunofluorescence, we found that transcription factors E2A, FOXO1 and FOXP1 were expressed and localized to the nuclei of these cancer cells. Over-expression of E2A, FOXO1 or Foxp1 increased RAG expression, while RNA interference of E2A, FOXO1 or FOXP1 decreased RAG expression in the cancer cells. Chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments showed acetylation of RAG enhancer (Erag) and E2A, FOXO1 or FOXP1 were bound to Erag in vivo. These results indicate that in these cancer cells the transcription factors E2A, FOXO1 and FOXP1 regulate RAG expression, which initiates Ig gene rearrangement much in the way similar to B lymphocytes.",

    "abstract": "The beta2 integrin lymphocyte function-associated antigen-1 (LFA-1; CD11a/CD18) is important for lymphocyte trafficking and activation as well as recruitment to sites of tissue inflammation. The objective of this study was to assess the role of 'T-cell-associated' LFA-1 in the pathogenesis of chronic colitis in vivo. Transfer of CD4+CD25- T cells isolated from wild-type (wt) mice into immunodeficient recipients [recombinase-activating gene-1-deficient (RAG-1-/-] produced moderate to severe colitis, whereas RAG-1-/- mice injected with CD11a-deficient (CD11a-/-; LFA-1-/-) donor T cells displayed minimal macroscopic and histological evidence of colitis. Surface expression of L-selectin, alpha4, alpha4beta7 and chemokine receptor-7 were similar for wt and CD11a-/- donor T cells. Attenuated disease in the CD11a-/- --> RAG-1-/- animals was associated with decreased numbers of CD4+ T cells in the mesenteric lymph nodes (MLNs), spleen and intestinal lamina propria (LP). In addition, significant reductions in Th1 cytokines were observed following ex vivo stimulation of mononuclear cells obtained from the MLNs and colonic LP. Interestingly, mononuclear cells obtained from the spleens of CD11a-/- --> RAG-1-/- exhibited enhanced pro-inflammatory cytokine production compared with splenocytes obtained from wt --> RAG-1-/- colitic mice. Taken together, our data suggest that T-cell-associated CD11a (LFA-1) expression plays a dual role in the initiation of chronic gut inflammation by facilitating naive T-cell priming/activation and expansion within MLNs and by augmenting pro-inflammatory cytokine production following secondary stimulation by antigen-presenting cells in the colonic interstitium.",

    "abstract": "Autoreactive B cells are regulated in the BM during development through mechanisms, including editing of the B cell receptor (BCR), clonal deletion, and anergy. Peripheral B cell tolerance is also important for protection from autoimmune damage, although the mechanisms are less well defined. Here we demonstrated, using a mouse model of SLE-like serology, that during an autoimmune response, RAG was reinduced in antigen-activated early memory or preplasma B cells. Expression of RAG was specific to antigen-reactive B cells, required the function of the IL-7 receptor (IL-7R), and contributed to maintenance of humoral tolerance. We also showed that soluble antigen could diminish a non-autoreactive antibody response through induction of BCR revision. These data suggest that tolerance induction operates in B cells at a postactivation checkpoint and that BCR revision helps regulate autoreactivity generated during an ongoing immune response.",

    "abstract": "Orange juice is a suspension of heterogeneous particles in a clear serum. The size of the particles varies between 0·05 μm and a few hundred μm. The particles with a size below 2 μm constitute the stable ‘cloud’. This fraction consists of needle-like crystals of hesperidin, chromoplastids, amorphous (rag) particles and oil globules attached to some of these particles. The adsorption of oil globules on the rag particles enhances their stability in suspension, by decreasing their density. The hesperidin crystals are formed partly by crystallisation immediately after juice extraction. All the cloud particles exhibit a negative charge, which decreases with decreasing pH. However, it seems that hydration rather than electrical charge is responsible for the stabilisation of the cloud. Heat treatment of the juice causes an increase in the number of fine particles at the expense of coarser ones. In this process some extraction of pectin into the serum also takes place but this has little significance on the cloudiness and cloud stability of the juice.",

    "title": "Epitopes of the Onchocerca volvulus RAL1 antigen, a member of the calreticulin family of proteins, recognized by sera from patients with onchocerciasis",
    "abstract": "RAL1 is an antigen (Ag) encoded by the filarial nematode Onchocerca volvulus, the parasite causing onchocerciasis (river blindness). RAL1 shares 64.4% identity with the autoantigen calreticulin. The striking similarity of the parasite Ag and the human autoantigen has led to the hypothesis that RAL1 may induce a cross-reactive immune response to calreticulin, which in turn may be involved in the pathogenesis of onchocerciasis. To test this hypothesis, we explored the immune response to RAL1 recombinant Ag (RAL1 rAg) and human calreticulin in patients with O. volvulus infection. A total of 86% of the O. volvulus-infected individuals produced antibodies recognizing RAL1 rAg. Antibody reactivity to RAL1 rAg in patient sera was confined primarily to the central and carboxyl-terminal parts of the molecule. No significant correlations were found to associate recognition of RAL1 rAg, or any particular portion thereof, with a particular disease state. Antibodies against RAL1 thus appear to be produced as a general immune reaction to O. volvulus infection and do not necessarily lead to a cross-reacting response with the host protein. In contrast, 33% of the patient sera tested bound recombinant human calreticulin. All of these sera also recognized a polypeptide encompassing the carboxyl-terminal portion of the RAL1 rAg. These results suggest that recognition of an epitope encoded in the carboxyl-terminal portion of RAL1 is at least in part responsible for inducing a cross-reacting immune response to the host protein.",

    "abstract": "The origin of the vascular hyperplasia seen in glioblastoma multiforme is a matter of debate. To test the predominant hypothesis that these glomeruloid structures are of endothelial origin the following study was undertaken. Seven glioblastomas containing prominent glomeruloid vascular structures were stained with Ulex europaeus agglutinin I (UEA-1) and with antibodies against factor VIII/related antigen (fVIII/RAg), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), S-100 protein, muscle specific a-actin (MSA) and smooth muscle specific a-actin (SMSA). The GFAP and S-100 antibodies stained the neoplastic glial component of each tumor but did not bind to vascular cells. Endothelial cells lining the lumina of normal vessels and the lumina of glomeruloid vascular structures stained positively with both UEA-1 and fVIII/RAg antibody. No other cells were found to be stained by UEA-1 or by fVIII/RAg antibody. Smooth muscle cells of the normal vasculature stained positively exclusively with anti-MSA and anti-SMSA antibodies. The same pattern of positive actin antibody staining was seen in the majority of cells forming the glomeruloid structures; however, the cells lining the vascular lumina did not bind the MSA and SMSA antibodies. These data strongly suggest that the vascular proliferation resulting in glomeruloid structures is due in large measure to smooth muscle hyperplasia.",

    "abstract": "The intestinal lamina propria (LP) is a major effector site of the mucosal immune system where antigen-specific and antigen-nonspecific factors shape the functional responses of CD4+ T helper cells. To study the functional differentiation of LP T helper cells we utilized DO11.10 T cell receptor (TCR) transgenic (Tg) mice that expressed a clonotypic TCR specific for a class II major histocompatibility complex-restricted peptide of chicken ovalbumin. The majority of cells expressing Tg TCR (Tg+) in peripheral lymphoid tissue expressed naive surface phenotypes whereas nearly all Tg+ T cells in the intestinal LP expressed an activated/ memory-like phenotype. Flow cytometric analysis of Tg+ T cell populations revealed that a small proportion of cells in peripheral lymphoid tissue but nearly all cells in the LP expressed dual (Tg plus non-Tg) TCRs. In Tg x recombinase-activating-gene-1-deficient (Tg x RAG-1(-/-)) mice, splenic and LP T cells expressed naive surface phenotypes and produced cytokines equivalent to naive splenic cells from Tg x RAG-1(+/+) mice. In contrast, Tg LP cells from Tg x RAG-1(+/+) mice produced 35-fold greater levels of interferon-gamma and 5-fold greater levels of interleukin 4 compared with naive splenic cells. These findings suggested that activation of Tg+ T cells through endogenous non-Tg TCR had promoted the localization and differentiation of memory-like effector T helper cells in the intestine.",

    "abstract": "The RAG-1 and RAG-2 genes synergistically confer VDJ recombinase activity to nonlymphoid cell lines. To unequivocally test RAG gene function, we created lines of mice that lack functional copies of these genes. Consistent with the possibility that RAG gene encode the tissue-specific components of VDJ recombinase, RAG-2-deficient mice are viable but have a severe combined immune deficiency due to inability to initiate VDJ recombination and thereby generate mature lymphocytes. RAG-2-deficient mice have no obvious defect in any tissue or lineage other than lymphocytes, indicating that VDJ recombinase activity and RAG-2-gene function is required only for lymphocyte development. Levels of RAG-1 and RAG-2 expression in primary murine lymphoid tissues and lymphoid bone marrow cultures generally are much higher than those of transformed precursor B-cell lines. Low-level RAG gene expression in permanent cell lines results from a decline during propagation due to outgrowth of cells with lower RAG expression levels. The low and variable level of RAG gene expression in transformed pre-B cell lines correlates with low and variable rates of endogenous VDJ recombination; therefore, such lines are not reliable models for experiments aimed at studying mechanisms that target this activity to particular variable region gene segments. To generate such a system, we introduced RAG genes into B-lineage lines under the control of a heat shock-inducible promoter; heat-shock treatment induces extremely high-level but transient RAG expression accompanied by parallel induction of VDJ recombinase activity. Such cells efficiently rearrange transfected VDJ recombination substrates in a regulated manner that is dependent on the activity of transcriptional control elements associated with the target V gene segments.",

    "title": "Bone marrow declines as a site of B-cell precursor differentiation with age: relationship to thymus involution.",
    "abstract": "The rearrangement of immunoglobulin genes in B-lymphocyte precursors requires the expression of the recombination activating genes (Rag), which leads to the generation of a highly diverse B-cell repertoire. We can use the level of Rag-1 mRNA in the bone marrow as an index of its capacity to support the maturation of B lymphocytes as all detectable bone marrow Rag-1 mRNA is expressed by B-cell precursors. In mouse bone marrow, Rag-1 mRNA increases during the first 2 months of life to reach its maximal level at 2 months of age. This level is maintained until 5 months of age and thereafter declines to a minimum level by 10 months of age. Thus, bone marrow Rag-1 mRNA is highest at the time when thymic function is maximal in euthymic mice. An association between thymic activity and bone marrow Rag-1 gene expression was supported by showing a low level of bone marrow Rag-1 mRNA in athymic nude mice at an age when this gene is maximally expressed in euthymic mice. Another characteristic of B cells in nude mice is their preferential rearrangement of diversity region (D)-proximal heavy-chain variable region (VH) genes. We demonstrated that injection of syngeneic splenic T cells into nude mice not only stimulates an increase in Rag-1 mRNA in their bone marrow B-cell precursors but also restores their random use of VH genes. Most interestingly, injection of supernatant medium from phytohemagglutinin-activated splenic T-cell cultures from young euthymic mice also induces both Rag-1 mRNA in bone marrow B-cell precursors and random use of VH genes. These findings suggest that thymic function can regulate both Rag-1 gene expression and VH gene use by bone marrow B-cell precursors.",

    "title": "Protective Intestinal Anti-Rotavirus B Cell Immunity Is Dependent on α4β7 Integrin Expression But Does Not Require IgA Antibody Production1",
    "abstract": "Rotavirus (RV) is the main cause of severe gastroenteritis in young children; protection has been correlated with intestinal Ab responses. Using a mouse model of RV infection and β7-deficient (β7−/−) mice, which do not express α4β7 integrin, we demonstrated the importance of α4β7 integrin in B cell-mediated anti-RV immunity. β7−/− mice acutely infected with murine RV resolved infection and developed normal serum IgG Abs but had diminished intestinal IgA responses. α4β7−/− immune B cells did not resolve RV infection when adoptively transferred into RV-infected Rag-2-deficient mice. Fewer RV-specific B cells were found in the intestine of Rag-2-deficient mice transferred with β7−/− B cells compared with wild type. The absence of α4β7 expression and/or a lower frequency of IgA-producing cells among transferred β7−/− B cells could have accounted for the inability of these cells to resolve RV infection following passive transfer. To distinguish between these possibilities, we studied the importance of IgA production in RV infection using IgA-deficient (IgA−/−) mice. IgA−/− mice depleted of CD8+ T cells were able to clear primary RV infection. Similarly, adoptive transfer of immune IgA−/− B cells into chronically infected Rag-2-deficient mice resolved RV infection. We further demonstrated in both wild-type and IgA−/− mice that, following oral RV infection, protective B cells reside in the α4β7high population. Our findings suggest that α4β7 integrin expression is necessary for B cell-mediated immunity to RV independent of the presence of IgA.",

    "title": "Targeted Transposition by the V(D)J Recombinase",
    "abstract": "ABSTRACT Cleavage by the V(D)J recombinase at a pair of recombination signal sequences creates two coding ends and two signal ends. The RAG proteins can integrate these signal ends, without sequence specificity, into an unrelated target DNA molecule. Here we demonstrate that such transposition events are greatly stimulated by—and specifically targeted to—hairpins and other distorted DNA structures. The mechanism of target selection by the RAG proteins thus appears to involve recognition of distorted DNA. These data also suggest a novel mechanism for the formation of alternative recombination products termed hybrid joints, in which a signal end is joined to a hairpin coding end. We suggest that hybrid joints may arise by transposition in vivo and propose a new model to account for some recurrent chromosome translocations found in human lymphomas. According to this model, transposition can join antigen receptor loci to partner sites that lack recombination signal sequence elements but bear particular structural features. The RAG proteins are capable of mediating all necessary breakage and joining events on both partner chromosomes; thus, the V(D)J recombinase may be far more culpable for oncogenic translocations than has been suspected.",

We have characterized the genomic organization of the human RAG locus, mapped the transcriptional initiation sites, and partially sequenced and performed functional reporter assays on the 5' flanking regions of human RAG1 and RAG2. Transcription initiation sites were mapped by rapid amplification of 5' cDNA ends, primer extension, and/or RNase protection in normal thymocytes, three pre-B cell lines, and a mature B cell line. A single promoter region was used for RAG1 transcription. In contrast, transcription of RAG2 initiates at two distinct regions of the genome. The 5'-flanking region of the human RAG2 gene is TATA-less; however, there is a GATAA consensus at position -34 with respect to the major transcriptional initiation site of RAG1. Promoter regions of human RAG1 and RAG2 are active in both lymphoid and nonlymphoid cell lines, suggesting that an outside regulatory element is probably involved in the tissue-specific transcriptional regulation of the RAG genes.",

    "abstract": "Two major DNA repair pathways, nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ) and homologous recombination (HR), repair double-stranded DNA breaks (DSBs) in all eukaryotes. Additionally, several alternative end-joining pathways (or subpathways) have been reported that characteristically use short-sequence homologies at the DNA ends to facilitate joining. How a cell chooses which DNA repair pathway to use (at any particular DSB) is a central and largely unanswered question. For one type of DSB, there is apparently no choice. DSBs mediated by the lymphocyte-specific recombination activating gene (RAG) endonuclease are repaired virtually exclusively by NHEJ. Here we demonstrate that non-RAG-mediated DSBs can be similarly forced into the NHEJ pathway by physical association with the RAG endonuclease.",

    "abstract": "Both anti-single-stranded (ss) and anti-double-stranded (ds) DNA antibodies are associated with the autoimmune disease systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), but only anti-dsDNA antibodies are considered one of the diagnostic criteria. Using Ig transgenes coding for anti-DNA we have determined the fate of anti-dsDNA B cells in a non-autoimmune environment. In a Rag-2 wild-type background, B cells expressing the anti-dsDNA Ig transgenes are present in the spleen but dsDNA specificity is disrupted due to expression of endogenous L chains. In a Rag-2-deficient background where co-expression of endogenous Ig is blocked, splenic B cells expressing only the anti-dsDNA transgene Ig are present, indicating that endogenous Ig expression is not required for bone marrow export. The anti-dsDNA B cells that persist are profoundly crippled in that they are unable to proliferate to lipopolysaccharide or anti-Ig stimulation. Furthermore, these anti-dsDNA Ig transgene B cells show a decreased lifespan relative to non-transgene BALB/c B cells. Persistence of anti-dsDNA B cells in the periphery of non-autoimmune mice raises the possibility that their appearance in the context of SLE is due to their reactivation by T cell help.",

    "abstract": "Products of recombination activating genes (RAG-1 and RAG-2) involved in the rearrangement of Ig genes have been shown to be expressed only in immature stages of B cells. However, we have recently found that RAG genes were re-expressed in mature mouse B cells activated in vitro and in germinal centers (GCs) of immunized mouse lymph nodes (LNs). Here, we report that RAG transcripts and their proteins were expressed in parallel with the formation of GCs in popliteal LNs from mice immunized in the hind footpads. Immunocytochemical analysis revealed that RAG+ B cells were localized within GCs and were present as apoptotic tingible body cells. RAG expression is not considered a nonspecific result of apoptosis, since apoptotic B cells generated by surface Ig-engagement did not express RAG genes. These results suggest a novel role of RAG products in the differentiation of B cells in GCs.",

Adoptive immunity was expressed more effectively in the spleens than in the lungs. Although CD4+ or unfractionated T cells protected both lungs and spleens, CD8+ T cells conferred significant protection only in the spleens and not in the lungs.

    "abstract": "A limiting factor impacting the quality and recovery of bitumen from oil sand operations is the formation of stable water-in-oil (w/o) and/or oil-in-water (o/w) emulsions during froth treatment. In a previous study, the impact of asphaltene partitioning on oil−water phase separation from the resulting emulsified phases (rag layers) was evaluated as a function of the solvent−bitumen−water ratio, temperature, and solvent aromaticity. In this work, the added effect of naphthenic amphiphiles at concentrations of 3 and 10 wt % on oil−water phase separation from similarly formulated rag layers is assessed. The observed phase behavior of these rag layers is discussed in view of interfacial coadsorption mechanisms proposed in the literature. A major finding is that, under alkaline process conditions, an increase in the concentration of sodium naphthenates (NaNs), produced as a result of naphthenic amphiphile dissociation, promotes a shift in emulsion morphology from w/o to o/w. The resulting transition from aspha...",

    "title": "Molecular Mechanism Underlying RAG1/RAG2 Synaptic Complex Formation*",
    "abstract": "Two lymphoid cell-specific proteins, RAG1 and RAG2 (RAG), initiate V(D)J recombination by assembling a synaptic complex with recombination signal sequences (RSSs) abutting two different antigen receptor gene coding segments, and then introducing a DNA double strand break at the end of each RSS. Despite the biological importance of this system, the structure of the synaptic complex, and the RAG protein stoichiometry and arrangement of DNA within the synaptosome, remains poorly understood. Here we applied atomic force microscopy to directly visualize and characterize RAG synaptic complexes. We report that the pre-cleavage RAG synaptic complex contains about twice the protein content as a RAG complex bound to a single RSS, with a calculated mass consistent with a pair of RAG heterotetramers. In the synaptic complex, the RSSs are predominantly oriented in a side-by-side configuration with no DNA strand crossover. The mass of the synaptic complex, and the conditions under which it is formed in vitro, favors an association model of assembly in which isolated RAG-RSS complexes undergo synapsis mediated by RAG protein-protein interactions. The replacement of Mg2+ cations with Ca2+ leads to a dramatic change in protein stoichiometry for all RAG-RSS complexes, suggesting that the cation composition profoundly influences the type of complex assembled.",

    "abstract": "The development of an optimized animal model for the in vivo analysis of human muscle cells remains an important goal in the search of therapy for muscular dystrophy. Here we examined the efficiency of human myoblast xenografts in three distinct immunodeficient mouse models. We found that different conditioning regimes used to provoke host muscle regeneration (i.e., cardiotoxin versus cryodamage) had a marked impact on xenograft success. Tibialis anterior muscle of Rag2-, Rag-/γc-, and Rag-/γc-/C5- mice was treated by cardiotoxin or cryodamage, submitted to enzymatic digestion, and analyzed by cytofluorometry to quantitate inflammatory cells. Human myoblasts were injected into pretreated muscles from immunodeficient recipients and the cell engraftment evaluated by immunocytochemistry, 4—8 weeks after transplantation. Donor cell differentiation and dispersion within the host muscles was also investigated. Host regeneration in cardiotoxin-treated mice was accompanied by a higher inflammatory cell infiltration when compared to that induced by cryodamage. Accordingly, when compared to the cardiotoxin group, more human myogenic cells were found after cryodamage. When the distinct immunodeficient mice were compared, we found that the alymphoid strain lacking the complement component C5 (Rag-/γc-/C5- mice) was the most efficient host for human muscle xenografts, when compared with C5+Rag-/γc- mice or Rag- mice. Our results demonstrate that cryolesion-conditioned muscles of Rag-/γc-/C5- mice provide the best environment for long-term in vivo human myoblast differentiation, opening the way for a novel approach to study the pathophysiology of human muscle disorders.",

    "abstract": "Surrogate light chain expression during B lineage differentiation was examined by using indicator fluorochrome-filled liposomes in an enhanced immunofluorescence assay. Pro-B cells bearing surrogate light chain components were found in mice, but not in humans. A limited subpopulation of relatively large pre-B cells in both species expressed pre-B cell receptors. These cells had reduced expression of the recombinase activating genes, RAG-1 and RAG-2. Their receptor-negative pre-B cell progeny were relatively small, expressed RAG-1 and RAG-2, and exhibited selective down-regulation of VpreB and lambda5 expression. Comparative analysis of the 2 pre-B cell subpopulations indicated that loss of the pre-B cell receptors from surrogate light chain gene silencing was linked with exit from the cell cycle and light chain gene rearrangement to achieve B-cell differentiation.",

    "abstract": "The T-cell receptor (TCR) beta chain is instrumental in the progression of thymocyte differentiation from the CD4-CD8- to the CD4+CD8+ stage. This differentiation step may involve cell surface expression of novel CD3-TCR complexes. To facilitate biochemical characterization of these complexes, we established cell lines from thymic lymphomas originating from mice carrying a mutation in the p53 gene on the one hand and a mutation in TCR-alpha, TCR-beta, or the recombination activating gene 1 (RAG-1) on the other hand. The cell lines were CD4+CD8+ and appeared to be monoclonal. A cell line derived from a RAG-1 x p53 double mutant thymic lymphoma expressed low levels of CD3-epsilon, -gamma, and -delta on the surface. TCR-alpha x p53 double mutant cell lines were found to express complexes consisting of TCR-beta chains associated with CD3-epsilon, -gamma, and -delta chains and CD3-zeta zeta dimers. These lines will be useful tools to study the molecular structure and signal transducing properties of partial CD3-TCR complexes expressed on the surface of immature thymocytes.",

TCR- (cid:97) (cid:50) / (cid:50) (cid:51) Ig (cid:109) (cid:50) / (cid:50) mice spontaneously developed colitis at an earlier age, and the colitis was more severe than in TCR- (cid:97) (cid:50) / (cid:50) mice. Colitis was induced in recombination-activating gene-1 (RAG-1 (cid:50) / (cid:50) ) mice by the transfer of mesenteric lymph node (MLN) cells from TCR- (cid:97) (cid:50) / (cid:50) (cid:51) Ig (cid:109) (cid:50) / (cid:50) mice. When purified B cells from TCR- (cid:97) (cid:50) / (cid:50) mice were mixed with MLN cells before cell transfer, colitis did not develop in RAG-1 (cid:50) / (cid:50) mice. Administration of the purified Ig from TCR- (cid:97) (cid:50) reactive led decrease in the number of apoptotic cells. These findings suggest that although B cells are not required for the initiation of colitis, B cells and Igs (autoAbs) can suppress colitis, presumably by affecting the clearance of apoptotic cells. / (cid:50) mice with or without Ig transfer) with CFA were injected into groups of five C57BL/6 mice (6 wk of age). The sera obtained 14 d after immunization were used for ELISA and immunohistochemical analysis of colonic tissue from RAG-1 (cid:50) / (cid:50) mice (nonspecific binding of secondary Ab to tissue is not present in RAG-1 (cid:50) / (cid:50) mice due to lack of B cells and Igs; reference 33). For ELISA, the purified colonic epithelial cells (2 (cid:51) 10 5 /well) from RAG-1 (cid:50) / (cid:50) mice were directly coated on plates by centrifugation. After fixation with EtOH for 10 min, the plates were blocked with 5% BSA and 2% rat serum/PBS, and serial dilution of sera from the immunized C57BL/6 mice was added and the antibody binding was detected by incubation with alkaline-phosphatase rat anti–mouse Ig (PharMingen).",

    "title": "Paleo-Immunology: Evidence Consistent with Insertion of a Primordial Herpes Virus-Like Element in the Origins of Acquired Immunity",
    "abstract": "Background The RAG encoded proteins, RAG-1 and RAG-2 regulate site-specific recombination events in somatic immune B- and T-lymphocytes to generate the acquired immune repertoire. Catalytic activities of the RAG proteins are related to the recombinase functions of a pre-existing mobile DNA element in the DDE recombinase/RNAse H family, sometimes termed the “RAG transposon”. Methodology/Principal Findings Novel to this work is the suggestion that the DDE recombinase responsible for the origins of acquired immunity was encoded by a primordial herpes virus, rather than a “RAG transposon.” A subsequent “arms race” between immunity to herpes infection and the immune system obscured primary amino acid similarities between herpes and immune system proteins but preserved regulatory, structural and functional similarities between the respective recombinase proteins. In support of this hypothesis, evidence is reviewed from previous published data that a modern herpes virus protein family with properties of a viral recombinase is co-regulated with both RAG-1 and RAG-2 by closely linked cis-acting co-regulatory sequences. Structural and functional similarity is also reviewed between the putative herpes recombinase and both DDE site of the RAG-1 protein and another DDE/RNAse H family nuclease, the Argonaute protein component of RISC (RNA induced silencing complex). Conclusions/Significance A “co-regulatory” model of the origins of V(D)J recombination and the acquired immune system can account for the observed linked genomic structure of RAG-1 and RAG-2 in non-vertebrate organisms such as the sea urchin that lack an acquired immune system and V(D)J recombination. Initially the regulated expression of a viral recombinase in immune cells may have been positively selected by its ability to stimulate innate immunity to herpes virus infection rather than V(D)J recombination Unlike the “RAG-transposon” hypothesis, the proposed model can be readily tested by comparative functional analysis of herpes virus replication and V(D)J recombination.",

    "title": "Constitutive Notch signalling promotes CD4 CD8 thymocyte differentiation in the absence of the pre-TCR complex, by mimicking pre-TCR signals.",
    "abstract": "Notch1 signalling is essential for the commitment of multipotent lymphocyte precursors towards the alphabeta T-cell lineage and plays an important role in regulating beta-selection in CD4(-)CD8(-) double-negative (DN) thymocytes. However, the role played by Notch in promoting the development of CD4(+)CD8(+) double-positive (DP) thymocytes is poorly characterized. Here, we demonstrate that the introduction of a constitutively active Notch1 (ICN1) construct into RAG(-/-) lymphocyte precursors resulted in the generation of DP thymocytes in in vitro T-cell culture systems. Notably, developmental rescue was dependent not only on the presence of an intact Notch1 RAM domain but also on Delta-like signals, as ICN1-induced DP development in RAG(-/-) thymocytes occurred within an intact thymus or in OP9-DL1 co-cultures, but not in OP9-control co-cultures. Interestingly, ICN1 expression in SLP-76(-/-) precursors resulted in only a minimal developmental rescue to the immature CD8(+) single-positive stage, suggesting that Notch is utilizing the same signalling pathway as the pre-TCR complex. In support of this, ICN1 introduction resulted in the activation of the ERK-MAPK-signalling cascade in RAG(-/-) thymocytes. Taken together, these studies demonstrate that constitutive Notch signalling can bypass beta-selection during early T-cell development by inducing pre-TCR-like signals within a T-cell-promoting environment.",

    "title": "SOLID WASTE MANAGEMENT IN DELHI – A SOCIAL VULNERABILITY STUDY",
    "abstract": "Management of burgeoning solid wastes has become a critical issue for almost all the major cities in India. Although the responsibility of solid waste management remains primarily with the municipal bodies, several other stakeholder groups play significant roles in the process. In the Indian scenario the so-called waste pickers, who come from highly vulnerable social backgrounds, play a unique role. Waste pickers, scavengers or rag pickers as they are commonly called eke out a living by collecting and selling recyclable materials out of municipal solid wastes. In the process they make a significant contribution to the environmental management in different metropolis’ over and above rendering a service to the local economy. The present paper intends to present a vulnerability study of the rag pickers of Delhi with focus on the socio-economic and occupational health aspects. The paper makes use of a database, parenting to the socio-economic profile of the rag pickers including the working conditions, and their problems and expectations. This database has been developed through literature review, questionnaire survey and open-ended interviews conducted to generate data on rag pickers in Delhi. Further, relevant policies of the Delhi Government have been ex amined to assess its understanding of the overall role of the waste pickers, and to explore the concerns and commitments of the Government towards them. Recommendations have been made to enhance the efficiency of the Government ventures in addressing the basic problems of the waste pickers, associated with deplorable working conditions, poor returns, exploitation and their everyday harassments. Suggestions have been made to improve the design of policy initiatives • Senior Program Officer (Chemicals and Health) Toxics Link, H-2 Jungpura Extension, Ground Floor, New Delhi110014.

    "title": "Homing and in situ differentiation of resident pulmonary lymphocytes.",
    "abstract": "At birth, T lymphocytes which colonize the lung are mainly of the gamma delta subset, while alpha beta T cells predominate in the spleen. Thus, the lung is a preferred site for the homing of gamma delta T cells in the perinatal period. However, after birth, the pattern of V gamma gene usage among resident pulmonary lymphocytes (RPL) changes with age, from a predominance of V gamma 6 at birth to a predominance of V gamma 4 in older mice. The generation of the V gamma 6 fraction appears to be thymus dependent, since in athymic nude mice, the V gamma 6 population present at birth is replaced by V gamma 4 T cells. In the postnatal period, both RAG-1 and RAG-2 genes are expressed at high levels in the RPL population. TCR bearing cells are among those that express RAG genes, indicating that maturation of T cells takes place in this organ. In addition, transfer experiments reveal that lymphoid precursors are present in the lung. The stage of differentiation of these precursors will be characterized in future studies. The data presented here indicate that pulmonary T lymphocytes are derived from both migrants of thymic origin and from precursors which have undergone differentiation and selection in the lung. The population that is generated in situ and that has not been selected in the thymus may include cells that are typical for the pulmonary environment.",

    "abstract": "Exclusion and inclusion of T cell receptor (TCR) genes were analyzed in alpha beta TCR transgenic mice. Both transgenes are expressed unusually early on the surface of CD4-8-, HSA+, IL-2R- thymocytes. These progenitor cells give rise to progeny, which at the single-cell level contains endogenous alpha but not beta TCR-RNA as well as protein, in addition to products encoded by the transgenes. Thus, the surface expression of an alpha beta TCR does not prevent further alpha TCR rearrangement in immature thymocytes that still transcribe RAG-1 and RAG-2 genes. Reduced levels of RAG-1 and RAG-2 RNA are detectable only in CD4+8+ TCR high cells, which result from positive selection in the thymus. The results suggest that a developing T cell may try different alpha beta TCRs for binding to thymic MHC ligands, and that recombination at the alpha locus ceases only after positive selection.",

    "title": "Expression of DNA-dependent protein kinase holoenzyme upon induction of lymphocyte differentiation and V(D)J recombination.",
    "abstract": "Murine preB lymphocytes grow in tissue culture in the presence of stromal cells and interleukin 7 (IL-7), and can be induced to differentiate to surface-immunoglobulin-positive B cells in vitro by withdrawal of IL-7. Upon differentiation, proliferation ceases, and upregulation of Rag-1 and Rag-2 expression, and induction of V(D)J immunoglobulin-gene rearrangements occur. DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) is required for effective V(D)J recombination and repair of DNA double-strand breaks. The holoenzyme comprises a catalytic subunit (DNA-PKcs) and the Ku heterodimer (Ku70/Ku80). We have analyzed expression of Ku70, Ku80 and DNA-PKcs upon induction of differentiation in preB cells derived from wild-type, severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) and Rag-2-/- mice. Protein levels of Ku80 and Ku70 moderately decrease after induction in all three cell types. A distinct polypeptide that crossreacts with anti-Ku Ig appears in the cytoplasm of wild-type and Rag-2-/- cells, but not of SCID cells. In mouse preB cells, Ku70 and Ku80 are present in the nuclei and cytoplasm before and after onset of differentiation. In vivo, Ku70 is predominantly expressed in V(D)J-recombination-active, early-preB and CD4-/CD8- thymocyte cell populations. Upon differentiation, protein levels of DNA-PKcs are unaltered. DNA-PK activity, which is not detectable in SCID cells, increases in wild-type and Rag-2-/- cells more than twofold shortly after induction of differentiation, then falls back to about 50% of starting levels.",

    "title": "Inhibition of Helicobacter hepaticus-Induced Colitis by IL-10 Requires the p50/p105 Subunit of NF-κB1",
    "abstract": "Defects within the innate immune system sensitize NF-κB-deficient (p50−/−; p65+/−) mice to Helicobacter hepaticus (Hh)-induced colitis. Because IL-10 plays a central role in the inhibition of Hh-induced colitis, we hypothesized that the ability of IL-10 to inhibit the innate inflammatory response to Hh may be compromised in NF-κB-deficient mice. To test this hypothesis, we evaluated the ability of an IL-10-Ig fusion protein with IL-10-like properties to inhibit Hh-induced colitis in RAG-2−/− (RAG) and p50−/−; p65+/−; RAG-2−/− (3X/RAG) mice. As expected, IL-10-Ig efficiently inhibited the development of colitis in RAG mice. In contrast, the ability of IL-10-Ig to inhibit colitis was compromised in 3X/RAG mice. The defect in response to IL-10-Ig appeared to be primarily the result of the absence of the p50/p105 subunit, because the ability of IL-10-Ig to inhibit colitis was also compromised in p50−/−; RAG-2−/− (p50/RAG) mice. Radiation chimeras demonstrated that the presence of p50/p105 within hemopoietic cells of the innate immune system was necessary for efficient inhibition of colitis by IL-10-Ig. Consistent with a defect in the suppressive effects of IL-10 in the absence of p50/p105, we found that the ability of IL-10 to control LPS-induced expression of IL-12 p40 was significantly compromised in macrophages lacking p50/p105. These results suggest that the absence of the p50/p105 subunit of NF-κB within hemopoietic cells of the innate immune system interferes with the ability of IL-10 to suppress inflammatory gene expression and Hh-induced colitis.",

    "abstract": "In animal models of acute lung injury (ALI), gene expression studies have focused on the acute phase of illness, with little emphasis on resolution. In this study, the acute phase of intratracheal lipopolysaccharide (IT LPS)-induced lung injury was similar in wild-type (WT) and recombinase-activating gene-1-deficient (Rag-1(-/-)) lymphocyte-deficient mice, but resolution was impaired and resolution-phase lung gene expression remained different from baseline only in Rag-1(-/-) mice. By focusing on groups of genes involved in similar biological processes (gene ontologies) pertinent to inflammation and the immune response, we identified 102 genes at days 4 and 10 after IT LPS with significantly different expression between WT and Rag-1(-/-) mice. After adoptive transfer of isolated CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ regulatory T cells (Tregs) to Rag-1(-/-) mice at the time of IT LPS, resolution was similar to that in WT mice. Of the 102 genes distinctly changed in either WT or Rag-1(-/-) mice from our 7 gene ontologies, 19 genes reverted from the Rag-1(-/-) to the WT pattern of expression after adoptive transfer of Tregs, implicating those 19 genes in Treg-mediated resolution of ALI.",

    "title": "PATTERNS OF ENGRAFTMENT IN DIFFERENT STRAINS OF IMMUNODEFICIENT MICE RECONSTITUTED WITH HUMAN PERIPHERAL BLOOD LYMPHOCYTES1",
    "abstract": "Background. Models of immunodeficient mice reconstituted with a competent human immune system would represent an invaluable tool for the study of transplantation immunobiology allergy, autoimmunity, and infectious diseases. Severe combined immune deficiency (scid) mice can be successfully reconstituted with human peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs), but rates and levels of engraftment are poor. New strains of mice with diverse immunodeficiencies have been recently characterized or developed, which might prove to be advantageous for in vivo studies of human immune reactivity. Methods. We have compared rates and patterns of human PBL engraftment in four available immunodeficient murine strains; scid-beige, nonobese diabetic (NOD)-scid, NOD-scid-&bgr;2 m− and rag−. T- and B-lymphocyte engraftment, phenotype of engrafted cells, and occurrence of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) were studied and compared. Results. Successful engraftment of human PBL was readily obtained in the majority of scid-beige, NOD-scid, and NOD-scid-&bgr;2 m− with a single i.p. administration of human PBLs, whereas it was seldom achieved in rag− animals. Human Ig levels were accordingly remarkably low in rag− recipients but, interestingly also in NOD-scid-&bgr;2 m− mice. Engraftment was readily observed not only in peripheral blood but also in spleen and bone marrow of successfully reconstituted animals. Phenotypic analysis of engrafted human cells showed preserved CD4/CD8 ratios and a clear skewing toward an activated phenotype. GVHD was invariably observed in successfully reconstituted animals. Conclusions. Our data indicate that a high rate of reconstitution with human lymphocytes can be achieved in scid-beige, NOD-scid, and NOD-scid-&bgr;2 m− mice. Human Ig are produced at high levels, except in NOD-scid-&bgr;2 m−, including xenoreactive natural antibodies. Scid-beige and NOD-scid appear therefore better suited than NOD-scid-&bgr;2 m− or rag− for analysis of human immunoreactivity in vivo. An important caveat is the invariable occurrence of GVHD that precludes long-term studies in this model system.",

    "title": "IL-6 Contributes to the Expression of RAGs in Human Mature B Cells1",
    "abstract": "Mature B cells acquire the capacity to revise rearranged Ig V region genes in secondary lymphoid organs. In previous studies, we demonstrated that cross-linking the BCR and the CD40 induces the expression of the RAG1 and RAG2 enzymes and, thereby, secondary rearrangements. We examine herein the mechanism that underpins RAG1 and RAG2 expression in peripheral and tonsil B cells. Coordinated engagement of the BCR and CD40 promoted the synthesis of IL-6 and, thereby, up-regulation of its receptor on activated B lymphocytes. Furthermore, we provide evidence that IL-6 initiates the expression of RAGs in circulating B cells, and extends those in tonsil B cells. Thus, neutralization of IL-6 or blocking of its receptor inhibits RAG expression. Moreover, we demonstrate that IL-6 impedes BCR-mediated termination of RAG gene expression in both population of B cells. The recovered inhibition of RAG gene transcription by IL-6 receptor blockade supports the notion that once recombination is launched, its termination is also regulated by IL-6. Taken together, these studies provide new insight into the dual role of IL-6 in inducing and terminating expression of the recombinase machinery for secondary rearrangements in mature human B cells.",

    "abstract": "Regulation of V-(D)-J recombinations that occur in antigen receptor encoding genes remains poorly understood. Recently, two genes, RAG1 and RAG2, that are able to activate rearrangement of synthetic recombination substrates were cloned in mouse and a human gene homologous to RAG1 was described. To define the differentiation stages corresponding to RAG1 and RAG2 RNA expression, we have studied a large number of B- and T-lymphoid neoplasias. First, we show that a human gene homologous to the murine RAG2 is transcribed in humans. Moreover, using a polymerase chain reaction approach, we have shown that RAG are expressed not only in T-cell receptor (TCR)-negative T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemias (T-ALLs), but also in some cases in which a significant percentage of cells expressed surface TCR. Absence of RAG expression was shown in certain T-ALLs at variable stages of thymic differentiation. Data obtained in B-lineage ALLs show that RAG RNAs are expressed in almost all slg- B-lineage ALLs but are not transcribed in the slg+ B-cell proliferations tested, including Burkitt's ALLs, follicular center cell lymphomas, and chronic leukemias. These findings are consistent with the involvement of RAG in the control of in vivo V-(D)-J recombinations. These findings are also of interest in the delineation of potential regulatory factors acting on RAG transcription and in the understanding of the mechanisms of specific chromosomal abnormalities occurring in immature lymphoid cells.",

This receptor revision mechanism could serve either receptor diversification or tolerance-induced functions. Alternatively, it might rescue those cells the receptors of which have been damaged by somatic mutation. Less is known about the occurrence of similar mechanisms in T cells. Here we show that mature T cells with defective TCR surface expression can express RAG genes and are capable of initiating secondary V(D)J rearrangements. The possibility that a cell rescue mechanism based on the generation of a novel Ag receptor might be active in peripheral T cells is envisaged.",

When assessed on a single-cell basis, there was a 3-fold increase in the frequency of RAG1- and RAG2-expressing B cells in SLE patients compared with healthy subjects. Notably, B cells expressing both RAG1 and RAG2 mRNA expressed only IgD mRNA, but not IgG mRNA. Fifty percent of RAG-expressing B cells also expressed VpreB mRNA, whereas all expressed CD154 mRNA. Phenotypic analysis indicated that RAG-expressing B cells were activated, mature B cells.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThese results indicate that RAG expression is up-regulated in peripheral IgD+ and VpreB+ B cells of patients with active SLE. These cells may contribute to the immunoregulatory abnormalities in patients with SLE.",

These included 196 sarcomas, 20 carcinomas and 14 angiomas. All angiomas showed positive staining for F VIII RAg; all carcinomas showed negative staining; the vasoformative areas of all angiosarcomas stained positively but only four of six angiosarcomas showed positive staining of their solid areas; of seven Kaposi's sarcomas, all showed positive staining of vessels and six showed positive staining of the spindle cell component. In the remaining 181 non‐vascular sarcomas there was a false positive result in four tumours (2.2%), three of which had a history of irradiation. Pre‐radiotherapy biopsies of these three tumours stained negatively with anti‐F VIII RAg. UEA‐I was demonstrated in all the angiomas studied, in all angiosarcomas (including the solid components) and in well‐formed vessels of all Kaposi's sarcomas, but only in the spindle cell component of 3/6. However, there was an unacceptably high rate of false positive staining amongst the carcinomas and non‐vascular sarcomas. In conclusion, F VIII RAg is a specific but not a sensitive marker of angiosarcomas; UEA‐I is a sensitive but not a specific marker of angiosarcomas.",

    "abstract": "IL-7 signaling is required for V(D)J recombination at the TCRγ locus. We have recently reported that IL-7 controls chromatin accessibility for RAG-mediated cleavage. Inhibition of histone deacetylase substituted for the IL-7 signal, indicating a role for histone acetylation in altering chromatin accessibility. We found a greatly reduced histone 3 and histone 4 acetylation level in IL-7Rα−/− thymocytes in comparison with RAG−/− thymocytes or fetal thymocytes. Sterile transcripts, indicating an open chromatin configuration, were suppressed in IL-7Rα−/− and IL-7−/−RAG−/− thymocytes. Moreover, exogenously added IL-7 induced sterile transcripts from the TCRγ constant region in cultured thymocytes from IL-7−/−RAG−/− mice. This induction correlated with increased histone acetylation at the J-promoter and C-enhancer regulatory elements at the TCRγ locus. These results suggest that IL-7 regulates chromatin accessibility for V(D)J recombination by specifically altering histone acetylation within the TCRγ locus.",

    "abstract": "We previously demonstrated that IL-7 is produced by intestinal goblet cells and is essential for the persistence of colitis. It is well known, however, that goblet cells are decreased or depleted in the chronically inflamed mucosa of animal colitis models or human inflammatory bowel diseases. Thus, in this study, we assess whether intestinal IL-7 is surely required for the persistence of colitis using a RAG-1/2−/− colitis model induced by the adoptive transfer of CD4+CD45RBhigh T cells in combination with parabiosis system. Surprisingly, both IL-7−/− × RAG-1−/− and IL-7+/+ × RAG-1−/− host mice developed colitis 4 wk after parabiosis to a similar extent of colitic IL-7+/+ × RAG-1−/− donor mice that were previously transferred with CD4+CD45RBhigh T cells. Of note, although the number of CD4+ T cells recovered from the spleen or the bone marrow of IL-7−/− × RAG-1−/− host mice was significantly decreased compared with that of IL-7+/+ × RAG-1−/− host mice, an equivalent number of CD4+ T cells was recovered from the lamina propria of both mice, indicating that the expansion of CD4+ T cells in the spleen or in the bone marrow is dependent on IL-7, but not in the lamina propria. Development of colitis was never observed in parabionts between IL-7+/+ × RAG-1−/− host and noncolitic IL-7−/− × RAG-1−/− donor mice that were transferred with CD4+CD45RBhigh T cells. Collectively, systemic, but not intestinal, IL-7 is essential for the persistence of colitis, suggesting that therapeutic approaches targeting the systemic IL-7/IL-7R signaling pathway may be feasible in the treatment of inflammatory bowel diseases.",

Here we demonstrate that a transposition hot spot (5'-GCCGCCGGGCC-3'), smaller portions of this hot spot and other GC rich motifs are able to target RAG-mediated transposition. Tracks of GC base pairs have been shown to have an unusually high rate of base pair breathing. Intriguingly, we find that DNA mismatches can efficiently target RAG-mediated transposition and suppress the use of other target sites. Hairpins, however, are not generally preferred targets. Our results indicate that target DNA melting may be a crucial step during RAG-mediated transposition, and that target site selection by the RAG transposase may be intimately linked to mutagenic and metabolic processes that transiently present favorable DNA structures to the transposition machinery.",

    "title": "Integration of synthetic aperture radar image segmentation method using Markov random field on region adjacency graph",
    "abstract": "A novel approach to obtain precise segmentation of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images using Markov random field model on region adjacency graph (MRF-RAG) is presented. First, to form a RAG, the watershed algorithm is employed to obtain an initially over-segmented image. Then, a novel MRF is defined over the RAG instead of pixels so that the erroneous segmentation caused by speckle in SAR images can be avoided and the number of configurations for the combinatorial optimisation can be reduced. Finally, a modification method based on Gibbs sampler is proposed to correct edge errors, brought by the over-segmented algorithm, in the segmentations obtained by MRF-RAG. The experimental results both on simulated and real SAR images show that the proposed method can reduce the computational complexity greatly as well as increase the segmentation precision.",

    "abstract": "The induction and perpetuation of chronic colitis are thought to involve a complex set of adhesive interactions between T cells and endothelial cells located on the vasculature within secondary lymphoid tissue and the intestine. The objective of this study was to assess the roles of T cell-associated CD18, CD62L (L-selectin), ICAM-1, and P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 (PSGL-1) in the induction of chronic colitis in mice. CD4(+)CD25(-) T cells derived from either wild-type (WT), CD18-deficient [CD18 knockout (KO)], CD62L KO, ICAM-1 KO, or PSGL-1 KO mice were adoptively transferred into recombinase activating gene-1 (RAG-1)-deficient mice (RAG KO mice) to assess the potential of these T cells to induce chronic colitis. At 8-10 wk following T cell transfer, we observed moderate to severe colitis as assessed by increases in colon weight-to-length ratios and by blinded histopathological analysis. In contrast, we found that transfer of CD18 KO T cells into RAG KO recipients resulted in the significant attenuation of colonic inflammation in these mice. Furthermore, we observed fewer infiltrating CD4(+) T cells in the colonic lamina propria in the CD18 KO-->RAG KO group compared with the WT-->RAG KO group. Finally, message levels of colonic TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, and IFN-gamma were significantly reduced in CD18 KO-->RAG KO mice compared with colitic control animals. We conclude that T cell-associated CD18, but not CD62L, ICAM-1, or PSGL-1, is required for the development of chronic colitis.",

    "abstract": "The activation and expression of recombination activating genes (RAGs) plays critical roles in V(D)J gene recombination machinery and lymphocyte development. We showed that RAG gene expression was induced in freshly isolated human bone marrow cells and a human lymphoid progenitor cell line, FL8.2.4.4, by coculture on a monolayer of a murine bone marrow-derived stromal cell line, PA6, in the presence of a mixture of recombinant cytokines. The RAG transcripts were detected 12 hours after initiation of culture, and the increased level was sustained at 24 hours. Among recombinant cytokines, interleukin-3 (IL-3), IL-6, and IL-7, but not IL-2, IL-4, stem cell factor (SCF), and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) could induce RAG-1 activation in FL8.2.4.4 cells, and a significant synergistic effect between IL-3, IL-6, and IL-7 was observed. Using a double chamber culture technique, it was shown that a cognate interaction between FL8.2.4.4 cells and PA6 stromal cells was a prerequisite for RAG-1 activation. Furthermore, RAG-1 transcripts were induced in FL8.2.4.4 cells when they were cocultured on paraformaldehyde-fixed PA6 stromal cells in the presence of cytokines. These results suggest that two separate signals are both required for induction of RAG-1 activation in lymphoid progenitors; one from the cell surface molecule(s) on stromal cells, and the other from the recombinant cytokine(s). Finally, we showed that expression of RAG mRNA in FL8.2.4.4 cells was concomitant with induction of recombinase activity. This system may provide useful means for further understanding the mechanisms controlling RAG activation and lymphocyte development in the human system.",

    "title": "Differential effects of zeta and eta transgenes on early alpha/beta T cell development",
    "abstract": "The zeta-family dimers (zeta, eta, and gamma) are a group of structurally and functionally related proteins that are expressed in developing thymocytes and function as signal transducing subunits of the T cell antigen receptor (TCR) and certain Ig Fc receptors. Zeta, eta, and gamma each contain one or more copies of a conserved tyrosine- based activation motif (TAM) that is known to be required for signal transduction. To examine the developmental importance of multiple or individual TAM elements we generated transgenic mice that express: (a) full-length (FL) zeta-chain (3 TAMs); (b) eta-chain, a naturally occurring variant of zeta that is derived from alternative splicing (2 TAMs); or (c) truncated zeta-chain (CT108; 1 TAM), under the control of the human CD2 promoter and regulatory elements. Unexpectedly, we found that overexpression of the FL zeta chain caused premature termination of RAG-1 and RAG-2 expression, prevented productive rearrangement of the TCR-alpha and TCR-beta genes and blocked entry of thymocytes into the CD4/CD8 developmental pathway. In contrast, we found that overexpression of eta or CT108 had no effect on normal thymocyte maturation. These results suggest that an early signaling pathway exists in precursor TCR- thymocytes that can regulate RAG-1 and RAG-2 expression and is differentially responsive to individual members of the zeta-family dimers.",

    "abstract": "A hybrid image segmentation algorithm is proposed which combines edge- and region-based techniques through the morphological algorithm of watersheds and consists of the following steps: (a) edge-preserving noise reduction, (b) gradient approximation, (c) detection of watersheds on gradient magnitude image, and (d) hierarchical region merging (HRM) in order to get semantically meaningful segmentations. HRM uses the region adjacency graph (RAG) representation of the image regions. At each step, the most similar pair of regions is determined (minimum cost RAG edge), the regions are merged and the RAG is updated. Traditionally, the above is implemented by storing all the RAG edges in a priority queue (heap). We propose a significantly faster algorithm which maintains an additional graph, the most similar neighbor graph, through which the priority queue size and processing time are drastically reduced. In addition, this region based representation provides one-pixel wide, closed, and accurately localized contours/surfaces. Experimental results using 2D real images are presented.",

Regions and their relations in an image are represented with region adjacency graph (RAG), which is a kind of attributed planar graph. The problem to find an optimal region correspondence, which matches the regions in two images with maximal similarity in region features and region relations, is formulated into the problem to find the optimal inexact matching between two RAGs. The properties specific to planar graph and that of the region adjacency relations are utilized to invent an efficient algorithm to solve the problem.

    "abstract": "When kept under strict specific-pathogen-free conditions, H-21-Abeta (Abeta(-/-),T-cell receptor beta (TCRbeta(-/-)), and recombinase-activating gene 1 (RAG-1(-/-) gene disruption mutant mice, deficient in conventional CD4+ T cells, TCRalphabeta cells, and all peripheral T and B lymphocytes, respectively, consistently developed lethal Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia through natural infection. The most severe symptoms appeared in RAG-1(-/-) mutants. In contrast, TCRdelta(-/-) and beta2-microglobulin(-/-)(beta2m-/-) mutants, deficient in TCRgammadelta cells and conventional CD8alphabeta+ TCRalphabeta cells, respectively, were fully resistant to infection. Our data indicate not only the insufficiency but also the dispensability of CD8 alphabeta+TCRalphabeta cells and of TCRgammadelta lymphocytes in resistance to P. carinii infection. Under disease conditions, large numbers of unusual single-positive CD4+ and CD8alphabeta+ as well as double-negative TCRgammadelta subpopulations of cells accumulated in lungs of TCRbeta(-/-) mutants. This accumulation was consistently accompanied by a drastic increase in the pulmonary B-cell population. In contrast, CD8alphabeta+ TCR alpha beta cells, but no B cells, appeared in lungs of parasitized Abeta (-/-) mutants. Since lung damage and parasite numbers were less prominent in morbid TCRbeta(-/-) and Abeta(-/-) mutants than in diseased RAG-1(-/-) mice, the remaining lymphocytes accumulating in lungs of the former two mutants seem to perform residual resistance functions.",

    "title": "B-Cell Deficiency Predisposes Mice to Disseminating Anaerobic Infections: Protection by Passive Antibody Transfer",
    "abstract": "ABSTRACT We have previously demonstrated that a high proportion of RAG-2 SCID knockout mice, which lack T and B cells, develop orofacial abscesses and disseminated infections following pulpal infection, whereas immunocompetent control mice do not. In the present study, we sought to identify the components of the adaptive immune response which contribute to protection against disseminating anaerobic infections and sepsis. For this purpose, various genetically engineered immunodeficient mice were employed, including RAG-2 SCID, Igh-6 (B-cell deficient), Tcrb Tcrd (T-cell deficient) and Hc0 (C5 deficient). For abscess induction, the mandibular first molars were subjected to pulp exposure on day 0. Teeth were infected with a mixture of four anaerobic pathogens, including Prevotella intermedia, Streptococcus intermedius,Fusobacterium nucleatum, and Peptostreptococcus micros, and teeth were sealed to prevent communication with the oral cavity. The findings demonstrate that both RAG-2 SCID and B-cell-deficient mice, but not T-cell- or C5-deficient mice, have increased susceptibility to the development of disseminating anaerobic infections. Abscess-susceptible RAG-2 SCID and B-cell-deficient mice also showed a significant loss of body weight, splenomegaly, and absent antibacterial antibody production. Furthermore, dissemination was significantly reduced, from 74 to 25%, in susceptible RAG-2 mice by passively transferred antibody, predominantly immunoglobulin G2b (IgG2b) and IgM, against the infecting bacterial innoculum. Fractionated IgG-enriched preparations were more efficient in transferring protection than IgM preparations. We conclude that an antibody-mediated mechanism(s), most likely bacterial opsonization, is of importance in localizing anaerobic root canal infections and in preventing their systemic spread.",

    "title": "The CD45 tyrosine phosphatase regulates CD3‐induced signal transduction and T cell development in recombinase‐deficient mice: restoration of pre‐TCR function by active p56lck",
    "abstract": "The pre‐TCR complex regulates the transition from CD4–CD8– double‐negative (DN) to CD4+CD8+ double‐positive (DP) thymocytes during T cell development. In CD45– / – mice there is an accumulation of DN cells, suggesting a possible role for CD45 in pre‐TCR signaling. We therefore crossed CD45– / – with Rag‐1– / – mice to investigate the signaling functions of the CD3 complex in DN thymocytes. Remarkably, treatment of Rag‐1– / – / CD45– / – mice with a CD3 mAb caused maturation to the DP stage at only 3 % of the level measured in Rag‐1– / – mice. Furthermore, ligation of the CD3 complex on Rag‐1– / – / CD45– / – thymocytes in vitro induced less tyrosine phosphorylation in specific proteins when compared to Rag‐1– / – thymocytes. CD45– / – mice were also crossed with pLGFA mice expressing a constitutively active form of the lck tyrosine kinase which restored the DN to DP transition to near normal levels. Our results are consistent with a model in which CD45‐activated p56lck is critical for pre‐TCR signal transduction.",

    "abstract": "F1 hybrid mice vigorously reject transplanted parental bone marrow (BM) cells, which is a phenomenon called \"hybrid resistance (HR)\". Since NK1.1+ cells play crucial role in HR, both NK1.1+CD3+ NKT cells and NK1.1+CD3– NK cells have been possible candidates of effector cells. To elucidate the major effector cells in HR, we employed Rag‐2– / – mice devoid of T, B, and NKT cells and cytokine receptor common γ subunit and Rag‐2 double‐deficient (γc– / –(y)‐Rag‐2– / –) mice lacking all lymphoid cells including NK cells. Rag‐2– / – F1 hybrid mice rejected parental BM cells to the extent similar to wild‐type (WT) F1 hybrids. In contrast, male γc− / y‐Rag‐2– / – F1hybrid mice were unable to reject parental BM cells. After reconstitution with NK but not NKT cells, male γc– / y‐Rag‐2– / – F1 hybrid mice restored the ability to reject parental BM cells. Collectively, it is concluded that NKT cells play little role, if any, and NK cells are the only cells involved in HR.",

    "title": "Expression of recombination-activating genes and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase and secondary rearrangement of immunoglobulin kappa light chains in rheumatoid arthritis synovial tissue.",
    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nLymphocytic infiltrates in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) synovium often resemble lymphoid follicles and contain clonally related Ig transcripts, suggesting in situ antigen-dependent B cell selection. Recent reports have shown expression of recombination-activating genes (RAGs) and concurrent secondary rearrangement of Ig genes in normal peripheral lymphoid organs (receptor revision). We sought to determine if RAG-mediated receptor revision of Ig kappa light chains occurs in B cells within the RA synovium. Because we previously reported enhanced N-region addition at V(L)-J(L) joins in clonally expanded light-chain transcripts from RA synovium, we also sought expression of terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT), which is normally expressed only in B cell precursors or immature B cells.\n\n\nMETHODS\nReverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to detect RAG and TdT transcripts from unselected and B cell-enriched synovial and peripheral blood mononuclear cells obtained from 12 RA patients. Activity of RAG protein was sought using ligation-mediated PCR to detect recombination intermediates, and immunohistochemistry was performed to identify RAG+ cells within synovia.\n\n\nRESULTS\nWe found evidence of RAG-mediated secondary Ig kappa light chain rearrangements in about one-third of RA synovia. TdT expression was found in several samples, but did not correlate with RAG expression.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nRAG-mediated secondary Ig rearrangements of kappa light chains may contribute to the local production of antibodies to autoantigens (e.g., rheumatoid factor) or exogenous antigens, or it may represent a failed attempt at immune tolerance. TdT expression suggests the presence of immature B cells in RA synovia. These findings have important implications for the local generation of antibodies in RA and other chronic inflammatory diseases.",

    "abstract": "The recombination‐activating genes (RAG) encode a site‐specific recombinase that is centrally responsible for the rearrangement of genomic V(D)J exons necessary to form functional immunoglobulin and T‐cell receptor genes. To help elucidate the origins of the RAG genes, we have cloned the RAG2 gene from the sandbar shark (Carcharhinus plumbeus) and characterized the entire RAG1/RAG2 gene locus. The shark RAG2 protein consists of 520 amino acids, is ~50% identical with RAG2 proteins from other vertebrates, and contains the same three domains identified in mammalian RAG2. Residues critical for RAG2 function are conserved in the shark sequence. In common with other vertebrate species, the shark RAG2 coding region lacks introns and is closely linked in opposite orientation to the RAG1 gene. The intergenic region is 9.4 kb, which is considerably larger than of teleosts (2–3 kb) and is comparable to that of tetrapods. This length is partially explained by the presence of several SINE and LINE fragments. The ancestors of the sharks were apparently the first vertebrates in phylogeny to have RAG genes, and our results confirm that the RAG genes have been highly conserved during evolution both in terms of sequence and gene organization.",

    "title": "A defensible maximum for inorganic sulfate in drinking water of cattle.",
    "abstract": "Twelve Hereford-Angus weanling heifers were used in a split:plot design incorporating a randomized complete block to determine physiological effects of subtoxic concentrations of inorganic sulfate in drinking water. Treatments were tap-water (110 mg/liter sulfate), 1,250 rag/liter sulfate and 2,500 rag/liter surface. The sulfate was added to the tap water as sodium sulfate. The sulfate-waters did not affect feed consumption, water consumption or growth during the 90-day experiment. No overt toxicity was observed. Heifers drinking sulfate-water had tendencies to accumulate methemoglobin and sulfhemoglobin without affecting total hemoglobin. Sulfate loading did not induce diuresis although heifers drinking 2,500 mg/liter sulfate-water increased renal filtration of sulfate by 37.7% and decreased renal reabsorption of this ion by 23.7%. Therefore, in these animals the percentage of filtered sulfate reabsorbed was decreased by 44.8%. The heifers were subsequently used in a taste response experiment in which they were offered either sodium chloride or sodium sulfate in a twochoice preference situation. The choice was the salt solution or tap-water. The salts were added to tap-water in increasing but estimated equal anionic concentrations in six increments from 275 to 4,400 mg/liter of anion. The animals discriminated against drinking water containing 1,620 mg/liter chloride or 2,018 rag/liter sulfate. Concentrations at the estimated rejection threshold were 5,524 and 3,317 rag/liter for chloride and sulfate, respectively. On a molar basis, discrimination and rejection thresholds for suffate were 21.0 and 34.5 raM, respectively. Those for chloride were 45.6 and 155.6 mMolar. Apparently, sulfate was more unpalatable than chloride when compared on an equimolar basis. It appears that these heifers were able to tolerate 2,500 rag/liter sulfate in their drinking water without adverse effects, and that this concentration of sulfate represents a safe tolerance concentration.

    "abstract": "The asymmetric disposition of T cell receptor (TCR) Cβ and Cα ectodomains creates a cavity with a side-wall formed by the rigid Cβ FG loop. To investigate the significance of this conserved structure, we generated loop deletion (βΔFG) and βwt transgenic (tg) mice using the TCR β subunit of the N15 CTL. N15βwt and N15βΔFG H-2b animals have comparable numbers of thymocytes in S phase and manifest developmental progression through the CD4−CD8− double-negative (DN) compartment. N15βΔFG facilitates transition from DN to CD4+8+ double-positive (DP) thymocytes in recombinase activating gene (RAG)-2−/− mice, showing that pre-TCR function remains. N15βΔFG animals possess ∼twofold more CD8+ single-positive (SP) thymocytes and lymph node T cells, consistent with enhanced positive selection. As an altered Vα repertoire observed in N15βΔFG mice may confound the deletion's effect, we crossed N15αβ TCR tg RAG-2−/− with N15βΔFG tg RAG-2−/− H-2b mice to generate N15αβ RAG-2−/− and N15αβ.βΔFG RAG-2−/− littermates. N15αβ.βΔFG RAG-2−/− mice show an 8–10-fold increase in DP thymocytes due to reduced negative selection, as evidenced by diminished constitutive and cognate peptide-induced apoptosis. Compared with N15αβ, N15αβ.βΔFG T cells respond poorly to cognate antigens and weak agonists. Thus, the Cβ FG loop facilitates negative selection of thymocytes and activation of T cells.",

    "abstract": "Background—Immune deficiency results in exuberant intimal thickening after arterial injury. The mechanisms involved are not well defined. We investigated the role of T cells and IFN-γ in the response to injury in normal and immune-deficient Rag-1KO mice. Methods and Results—Carotid arterial injury was induced in wild-type (WT), Rag-1KO mice, and Rag-1KO mice reconstituted with T cell-enriched splenocytes. The exuberant intimal thickening in Rag-1KO mice compared with WT mice 21 days after injury was reduced by T cell transfer (P<0.01). Exogenous IFN-γ starting on the day of injury inhibited intimal thickening in Rag-1KO mice. However, antibody neutralization of endogenous IFN-γ in Rag-1KO mice starting 7 days after injury decreased intimal thickening, indicating that late presence of IFN-γ promoted intimal thickening in Rag-1KO mice. Results further suggest that the effect of late IFN-γ in Rag-1KO mice is mediated in part by increased IRF-1 and iNOS expression, coupled with low SOCS1 expression. Conclusion—T cells inhibit intimal thickening in the early stages of the response to injury through basal IFN-γ secretion. In the Rag-1KO mice, late IFN-γ expression promotes intimal thickening. These findings add novel insight to conditions of immune deficiency that affect intimal thickening.",

    "abstract": "The immunoglobulin alpha (Ig alpha)/Ig beta heterodimer was detected on the surface of mu-negative proB cell lines in association with calnexin. The cross-linking of Ig beta on proB cells freshly isolated from bone marrow of recombination activating gene (RAG)-2-deficient mice induced a rapid and transient tyrosine-phosphorylation of Ig alpha as well as an array of intracellular proteins including Syk, PI3-kinase, Vav, and SLP-76. It also elicited the phosphorylation and activation of a MAP kinase ERK but not JNK/SAPK or p38. When RAG-2-deficient mice were treated with anti-Ig beta monoclonal antibody, developmentally arrested proB cells were induced to differentiate to the small preB cell stage as observed when the mu transgene was expressed in RAG-2-deficient mice. Thus, the cross-linking of Ig beta on proB cells appears to elicit differentiation signals analogous to those delivered by the preB cell receptor in normal B cell development.",

    "abstract": "Central to understanding the process of V(D)J recombination is appreciation of the protein-DNA complex which assembles on the recombination signal sequences (RSS). In addition to RAG1 and RAG2, the protein HMG1 is known to stimulate the efficiency of the cleavage reaction. Using electrophoretic mobility shift analysis we show that HMG1 stimulates the in vitro assembly of a stable complex with the RAG proteins on each RSS. We use UV crosslinking studies of this complex with azido-phenacyl derivatized probes to map the contact sites between the RAG proteins, HMG1 derivatives and the RSS. We find that the RAG proteins make contacts at the nonamer, heptamer and adjacent coding region. The HMG1 protein by itself appears to localize at the 3' side of the nonamer, but a cooperative complex with the RAG proteins is positioned at the 3' side of the heptamer and adjacent spacer in the 12RSS. In the complex with RAG proteins, HMG1 is positioned primarily in the spacer of the 23RSS. We suggest that bends introduced into these DNA substrates at specific locations by the RAG proteins and HMG1 may help distinguish the 12RSS from the 23RSS and may therefore play an important role in the coordinated reaction.",

    "abstract": "M14T is a virally transformed immature T-cell line which continues to rearrange its T-cell antigen receptor (TCR) alpha-chain genes in vitro and thus represents a dynamic system for studying TCR assembly. In an effort to investigate whether the TCR alpha locus is accessible for V(D)J rearrangement events, we examined M14T cells for the presence of germ line TCR alpha transcripts. Several unrearranged V alpha segments were found to be transcriptionally active in M14T cells. By comparison, germ line V alpha transcripts are absent in nonlymphoid and pro-T-cell lines and barely detectable in mature T-cell lines, suggesting that this phenomenon is likely stage and tissue specific. We demonstrate a perfect correlation between transcriptionally active V alpha segments and their involvement in ongoing V alpha-to-J alpha rearrangements. In addition, data suggesting that the unrearranged J alpha locus is also transcriptionally active in the M14T line are presented. Furthermore, the recombination-activating genes RAG-1 and RAG-2 are differentially expressed, with RAG-2 detectable only by polymerase chain reaction, implying that very low levels of one of these gene products are sufficient to complement the other to facilitate VJ rearrangements. These findings provide the first direct evidence for an accessibility model of antigen receptor rearrangement in T cells.",

Both endothelial cell markers made visible a greater number of instances of vascular invasion than were detected on routine elastic stains, but UEA‐1 lectin gave more reliable staining of endothelium lining large capsular veins and of blood vessels within the tumour than did F VIII‐RAg. In vessels completely occluded by tumour, examples of endothelial staining by UEA‐1 in the absence of F VIII‐RAg staining were found, but some such vessels appeared to lack surviving endothelial cells and in these no staining occurred. It is concluded that UEA‐1 lectin is a more reliable endothelial marker in this setting than F VIII‐RAg and may assist the demonstration of vascular invasion in these tumours.",

    "abstract": "Emulsan is a polyanionic heteropolysaccharide bioemulsifier produced by Acinetobacter calcoaceticus RAG-1. A mixed bacterial population was obtained by enrichment culture that was capable of degrading emulsan and using it as a carbon source. From this mixed culture, an emulsan-degrading bacterium, termed YUV-1, was isolated. Strain YUV-1 is an aerobic, gram-negative, non-spore-forming, rod-shaped bacterium which grows best in media containing yeast extract. When placed on preformed lawns of A. calcoaceticus RAG-1, strain YUV-1 produced translucent plaques which grew in size until the entire plate was covered. Plaque formation was due to solubilization of the emulsan capsule of RAG-1. Plaque formation was not observed on emulsan-negative mutants of RAG-1. As a consequence of the solubilization of the emulsan capsule, RAG-1 cells became more hydrophobic, as determined by adherence to hexadecane. Growth of YUV-1 on a medium containing yeast extract and emulsan was biphasic. During the initial 24 h, cell concentration increased 10-fold, but emulsan was not degraded; during the lag in growth (24 to 48 h), emulsan was inactivated and depolymerized but not consumed; during the second growth phase (48 to 70 h) the depolymerized emulsan products were consumed.",

    "abstract": "The inherited human disorders sialidosis and galactosialidosis are the result of deficiencies of glycoprotein-specific alpha-neuraminidase (acylneuraminyl hydrolase, EC 3.2.1.18; sialidase) activity. Two genes were determined to be necessary for expression of neuraminidase by using human-mouse somatic cell hybrids segregating human chromosomes. A panel of mouse RAG-human hybrid cells demonstrated a single-gene requirement for human neuraminidase and allowed assignment of this gene to the (pter----q23) region of chromosome 10. A second panel of mouse thymidine kinase (TK)-deficient LM/TK- -human hybrid cells demonstrated that human neuraminidase activity required both chromosomes 10 and 20 to be present. Analysis of human neuraminidase expression in interspecific hybrid cells or polykaryocytes formed from fusion of mouse RAG (hypoxanthine/guanine phosphoribosyltransferase deficient) or LM/TK- cell lines with human sialidosis or galactosialidosis fibroblasts indicated that the RAG cell line complemented the galactosialidosis defect, but the LM/TK- cell line did not. This eliminates the requirement for this gene in RAG-human hybrid cells and explains the different chromosome requirements of these two hybrid panels. Fusion of LM/TK- cell hybrids lacking chromosome 10 or 20 (phenotype 10+,20- and 10-,20+) and neuraminidase-deficient fibroblasts confirmed by complementation analysis that the sialidosis disorder results from a mutation on chromosome 10, presumably encoding the neuraminidase structural gene. Galactosialidosis is caused by a mutation in a second gene required for neuraminidase expression located on chromosome 20.",

    "abstract": "Inherited demyelinating neuropathies are chronically disabling human disorders caused by various genetic defects, including deletions, single site mutations, and duplications in the respective myelin genes. We have shown in a mouse model of one distinct hereditary demyelinating neuropathy (heterozygous P0-deficiency, P0+-) that an additional null mutation in the recombination activating gene-1 (RAG-1--) leads to a substantially milder disorder, indicating a disease modifying role of T-lymphocytes. In the present study, we addressed the role of lymphocytes in the mouse model by reconstituting bone marrow of P0+-/RAG-1-- mice with bone marrow from immunocompetent wild-type mice. We compared the pathology and nerve conduction in double mutant mice (P0+-/RAG-1-- on a C57BL/6 background) with that in double mutants after receiving a bone marrow transplant. We found that the milder demyelination seen in the lymphocyte-deficient P0+-/RAG-1-- mutants was reverted to the more severe pathology by reestablishing a competent immune system by bone marrow transfer. These data corroborate the concept that the immune system contributes substantially to the pathologic process in this mouse model and may open new avenues to ameliorate human hereditary neuropathies by exploiting immunosuppressive treatments.",

    "title": "V(D)j Recombination Becomes Accessible",
    "abstract": "The diverse antigen receptor repertoires of B and T lymphocytes are generated by somatic rearrangement of Ig and TCR V, D, and J gene segments during lymphocyte development. A basic mechanistic understanding of V(D)J recombination reaction is now at hand. The process is initiated by recombinase proteins recombination activating gene (RAG)-1 and RAG-2, which bind to recombination signal sequences (RSSs) that flank Ig and TCR gene segments, recruit a pair of RSSs into a synaptic complex, and generate double strand breaks (DSBs) between the RSSs and coding segments. The reaction is then completed with the additional participation of DSB repair proteins, which help to process and rejoin the coding and signal end molecules to generate coding joints and signal joints, respectively. V(D)J recombination at the various Ig and TCR loci is highly regulated during lymphocyte development, with lineage- and developmental stage‐specific rearrangement events distinguishing individual loci, and even individual gene segments within loci. It has long been appreciated that this developmental regulation cannot be accounted for by the expression of either RAG or DNA repair proteins. It has been noted that transcription of unrearranged gene segments (germline transcription) parallels their developmental activation for V(D)J recombination.

    "abstract": "Rag-1 and Rag-2 are essential for the construction of the BCR repertoire. Regulation of Rag gene expression is tightly linked with BCR expression and signaling during B cell development. Earlier studies have shown a major role of the PI(3)K/Akt pathway in regulating the transcription of Rag genes. In this study, by using the 38c13 murine B cell lymphoma we show that transcription of Rag genes is also regulated by the MEK/ERK pathways, and that both pathways additively coordinate in this regulation. The additive effect is observed for both ligand-dependent (upon BCR ligation) and ligand independent (tonic) signals. However, whereas the PI(3)K/Akt regulation of Rag transcription is mediated by Foxo1, we show in this study that the MEK/ERK pathway coordinates with the regulation of Rag by controlling the phosphorylation and turnover of E47 and its consequential binding to the Rag enhancer regions. Our results suggest that the PI(3)K and MEK/ERK pathways additively coordinate in the regulation of Rag transcription in an independent manner.",

    "abstract": "V(D)J recombination in lymphocytes is mediated by 2 recombination-activating genes, RAG1 and RAG2, which are expressed during lymphocyte development in bone marrow and thymus. Prompted by studies reporting re-expression of the RAGs in germinal center B cells, the expression of RAGs and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) in human lymphoid tissues was examined using in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry, respectively. Here it is shown that RAGs and TdT are not reinduced in germinal center reactions. However, RAG(+)/TdT(+) cells are frequently present in extrafollicular areas of tonsils mainly at the boundary between lymphoid tissue and fibrous scaffold. Phenotypic analyses suggest that these cells are B cells. Finally, it is shown that RAG(+)/TdT(+) cells are found more frequently in tonsils than in other peripheral lymphoid tissues. This may reflect an increased influx of RAG(+)/TdT(+) cells as a result of higher antigenic stimulation at this site. Alternatively, this observation may indicate that the tonsils are an additional site of lymphocyte ontogeny.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT RAG-1 and RAG-2 initiate V(D)J recombination by binding to specific recognition sequences (RSS) and then cleave the DNA in two steps: nicking and hairpin formation. Recent work has established that a dimer of RAG-1 and either one or two monomers of RAG-2 bind to a single RSS, but the enzymatic contributions of the RAG molecules within this nucleoprotein complex and its functional organization have not been elucidated. Using heterodimeric protein preparations containing both wild-type and catalytically deficient RAG-1 molecules, we found that one active monomer is sufficient for both nicking and hairpin formation at a single RSS, demonstrating that a single active site can carry out both cleavage steps. Furthermore, the mutant heterodimers efficiently cleaved both RSS in a synaptic complex. These results strongly suggest that two RAG-1 dimers are responsible for RSS cleavage in a synaptic complex, with one monomer of each dimer catalyzing both nicking and hairpin formation at each RSS.",

    "title": "Induction of sterile transcription from the kappa L chain gene locus in V(D)J recombinase-deficient progenitor B cells.",
    "abstract": "B cell development in RAG-2-deficient (RAG-2T) mice is impeded at an early stage, due to the inability of these animals to rearrange their endogenous ig gene loci. Expression of an E mu-bcl-2 transgene in these mice did not change this phenotype. However, stromal cell/IL-7-reactive B cell progenitors (pro-B cells) were found in fetal live and bone marrow of RAG-2T and RAG-2T/E mu-bcl-2 transgenic mice in numbers comparable to normal mice. Like cells from normal mice they are c-kit+, surrogate L chain+ and CD25-, and can proliferate in vitro for long periods of time. Upon IL-7 deprivation, they can be induced to differentiate into c-kit-, surrogate L chain- and CD25+ cells that are no longer clonable on stromal cells and IL-7. Furthermore, sterile transcription from the kappa L chain gene loci is induced. The latter was also observed with pro-B cells directly isolated ex vivo from the bone marrow of RAG-2-deficient animals. The results suggest that progenitor B cell differentiation can occur in cells from V(D)J recombinase-deficient mice to the stage where kL chain gene rearrangements would normally be initiated. It further indicates that some molecular programs of early B cell differentiation can take place in the absence of Ig gene rearrangements.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this retrospective observational study was to delineate determinants for antegrade flow and entire patency of the sequential radial artery graft (RAG) in the left circumflex artery (LCX) and right coronary artery (RCA). Angiograms of 432 RAGs, which were sequentially anastomosed to the LCX and RCA, and were proximally anastomosed with the in-situ internal thoracic artery as the composite I- or Y-graft, were studied. The mean targets of RAG were 2.83±0.79. We examined effects of characteristics of RAG and the targets, such as native coronary stenosis and their combinations, on competitive flow and occlusion. Of 432 RAGs, 413 (95.6%) were patent to all targets, while 331 (76.6%) provided antegrade flow to all targets in sequential anastomoses. By the univariate and multivariate analyses, 51-75% stenosis of the most distal target was identified as the significant predictor of competitive flow or occlusion (OR=8.59, P<0.0001). The cumulative graft patency rate of RAGs with 76-100% stenosis of the most distal target at 40 months was 88.6%, whereas that of RAGs with 51-75% stenosis of the most distal target was 59.1% (P<0.0001). In sequential RAG, severity of stenosis in the most distal target had the significant impact on prevention of competitive flow and long-term patency to all targets.",

    "title": "Inducing the Loss of Immunoglobulin Light Chain Production and the Rearrangement of a Previously Excluded Allele in Human Plasma B Cell Lines with Concanavalin A*",
    "abstract": "We investigated the expression of differential λ light chains in human B cell lines secreting immunoglobulin (Ig). When these cell lines were cultured with concanavalin A for a long period of time, a subpopulation of some but not all of these cell lines was induced to express new λ light chains replacing the original λ chain (light chain shifting). Production of the new λ chain, which replaces the original λ chain, results from a VJ rearrangement at a previously excluded allele and a dramatic reduction of the original λ chain transcript, although no difference was found in the level of heavy chain transcript. Recombination activating genes RAG-1 and RAG-2, which are normally expressed during specific early stages of lymphocyte development, were expressed in not only the light chain shifting-inducible lines but also in the non-inducible cells. Treatment of these Ig secreting cell lines with dibutyryl cAMP, which is known to enhance expression of the RAG genes, could not induce the creation of new λ light chain-producing cells from the inducible lines, suggesting that the expression of the two RAG genes is not sufficient for inducing new λ light chain production. Concanavalin A induced a gradual but significant production lost of the original λ chain in a subpopulation of the light chain shifting-inducible cells but not in the non-inducible cells. Association of new λ light chain production with loss of original λ chain raises the possibility that, when the RAG genes are expressed, concanavalin A may act on a novel intracellular mechanism controlling λ light chain allelic exclusion in these plasma cell lines.",

Expression of both genes is lymphocyte‐specific and RAG levels are tightlyregulated throughout lymphopoiesis and cell cycle. To assess the significance of this pattern of expression, we generated transgenic mice expressing the Rag genes both continuously throughout lymphocyte development and constitutively in most non‐lymphoid tissues. The transgenes partially complement an endogenous Rag2 null mutation and lead to a partial block in early B and T lymphopoiesis when introduced on a Rag2 sufficient background. The defect in thymocyte number is restricted to the α β lineage leaving the γ δ T cell pool intact, while neither IgH phenotypic allelicexclusion nor the κ/λ light chain ratio are altered. Finally, the ectopic expression of the Rag genes associates with growth retardation and early death of the animals, a phenotype reminiscent of those reported for mice deficient in double‐strand break repair molecules.",

    "title": "Regulation of antibody response in vitro. 8. Multiplicity of soluble factors released from carrier-specific cells.",
    "abstract": "Mesenteric lymph node cells were obtained from rabbits that were primed with dinitrophenylated ragweed antigen (DNP-Rag) and supplemented with free Ascaris antigen (Asc); in vitro anti-hapten antibody response of the primed cells was studied. It was found that stimulation of Rag-sensitized cells with free Rag enhanced anti-DNP antibody response to DNP-unrelated carrier conjugate (DNP-KLH) but suppressed the response of the same cell suspension to DNP-Asc. It was also found that both IgG and IgE antibody responses to DNP-Rag were suppressed by the addition of free Asc with the homologous antigen. Mechanisms involved in the enhancement and suppression of antibody response by free carrier were explored with cell-free supernatant (CFS) obtained from the culture of primed lymph node cells with free carrier. The results showed that essentially all CFS preparations studied enhanced antibody response when they were added to primed lymph node cells which had been treated with a hapten-protein conjugate. Some of the CFS preparations, however, suppressed antibody response of the same primed cells, if they were added to the cells together with the antigen. Evidence was obtained which indicated that suppression of the antibody response by CFS is not due to an excess amount of enhancing soluble factor. Several preparations of CFS were incubated with the same primed cell suspension, either before or after incubation with antigen, to determine their suppressive effect and enhancing effect. The results showed that suppressive effect of CFS on the unstimulated cells did not correlate with their enhancing effect on the antigen-stimulated cells. The experiment eliminated the possibility that the same T cell factor expresses two opposite effects depending on the stage of B cell differentiation, and suggested the presence of both suppressive and enhancing soluble factors in the preparations of cell free supernatant. The experiment also showed that enhancing soluble factor for IgE antibody response was obtained from carrier-specific cells primed with alum-precipitated antigen but the cells proliferated by the immunization with the carrier included in complete Freund9s adjuvant did not release the enhancing soluble factor for IgE. It was also found that enhancing soluble factor for IgG antibody neither enhanced nor suppressed IgE antibody response.",

    "abstract": "Alasan, the exocellular polymeric emulsifier produced by Acinetobacter radioresistens KA53 was shown to bind to the surface of Sphingomonas paucimobilis EPA505 and Acinetobacter calcoaceticus RAG-1. The presence of alasan on the surface of S. paucimobilis EPA505 and A. calcoaceticus RAG-1 caused a decrease in their cell-surface hydrophobicities. Binding was proportional to the concentration of recipient cells and input alasan. At the highest concentration of A. calcoaceticus RAG-1 (4 x 10(9) ml(-1)) and alasan (20 microg ml(-1)) tested, 75% of the alasan was cell bound. Alasan binding was measured by the loss of emulsifying activity and alasan protein and polysaccharide from the aqueous phase after incubation of alasan with the recipient cells. In addition, alasan was visualized on the surface of the recipient cells by staining with anti-alasan antibodies and rhodamine-labelled secondary antibodies. Moreover, when the alasan-producing A. radioresistens KA53 was grown together with A. calcoaceticus RAG-1, alasan was released from the producing strain and became bound to the recipient RAG-1 cells, as demonstrated by fluorescence microscopy. This horizontal transfer of exopolymers from one bacterial species to another has significant implications in natural microbial communities, coaggregation and biofilms.",

When RAG was fed orally to vitamin A-deficient rats, RA was identified as the major metabolite in the serum within hours of administration of RAG. Very little or no RAG was detected in the serum. Thus RAG, which was not appreciably hydrolysed to RA in vitamin A-sufficient rats [Barua and Olson (1987) Biochem. J. 263, 403-409], was rapidly converted into RA in vitamin A-deficient rats.",

    "title": "Retinoyl β-Glucuronide: A Biologically Active Interesting Retinoid",
    "abstract": "Numerous reports have indicated that the biological activity of all-trans retinoyl beta-glucuronide (RAG) is similar to that of all-trans-retinoic acid (RA), but without the toxic side effects of RA. In the present series of studies, we report new findings that support the contention that RAG can function as a nontoxic substitute for RA in a variety of clinic settings. One study on the effects of s.c. injected graded doses of RA and RAG (20-480 micromol/kg BW) into pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats showed that any differences between RAG and RA could be observed only at the highest dose levels of 360 and 420 micromol/kg BW, with RAG being much less toxic than RA. Similarly, daily topical application of RAG (0.16-1.6%) and RA (0.1-0.5%) to shaved swine dorsal skin for six mo resulted in redness and scabbing in RA-treated patches, and to a lesser extent in 1.6% RAG-treated, but not in other RAG-treated patches. Histological scores were significantly higher in the dermis and epidermis of RA-treated pigs than in RAG-treated pigs. Studies to document the pharmacokinetics of chronically administered RAG in mice indicated that, unlike RA, sustained blood levels of parent retinoid (RAG) can be achieved during at least 2 mo of daily administration. Another investigation to study the effects of RAG on the development and growth in nude mice of tumors derived from the human neuroblastoma cell line LA-N-5 showed that s.c. injection of RAG (30 micromol/kg BW) reduced tumor formation when the retinoid was first administered 3 d before tumor injection and continued daily for 30 d thereafter. In established tumors, RAG was shown to inhibit progressive tumor growth, the antitumor effects of RAG being comparable with RA. However, with RAG, as opposed to RA, there were no significant adverse physical side effects. Based on the results of these series of studies along with ample published reports over the last 15 y, we conclude that RAG may be a safe and effective alternative to RA and some other retinoids that are presently being utilized in the clinic.",

    "abstract": "Abstract: Like all antibodies, autoreactive antibodies are generated in developing B cells in the bone marrow by variable (V), diversity (D), and joining (J) recombination under the regulation of recombination activating gene (RAG) 1 and RAG2 proteins. Deletion, anergy, and receptor edition prevent the emergence of autoreactive B cells. In the periphery, somatic hypermutation during the course of germinal center responses can lead to the emergence of autoreactive and low‐affinity antibody‐producing B cells. Deletion and receptor revision regulate autoreactive and inappropriate B cells. Defects in central or peripheral tolerance mechanisms associated with RAG expression could contribute to the appearance of autoreactive B cells. We demonstrate the presence of RAG+ B cells in CD5‐expressing cells outside germinal centers. Our data suggest that receptor revision in the periphery also may occur in unusual sites when B cells are induced to express CD5. This revision may correspond to a novel regulation checkpoint in which impaired control of RAG expression could generate autoreactive B cells and lead to autoimmune states.",

    "abstract": "A central problem for real-time scheduling is to acquire tight but conservative bounds on task execution times. We present a prototype for an environment where such bounds are interactively presented, in terms of source code constructs, to the programmer during development. The prototype is based on the language development tool APPLAB and uses an extended attribute grammar formalism, reference attributed grammars (RAGs), which overcomes some drawbacks of conventional attribute grammars in this context (e.g. description of non-local dependencies). In this paper we show how timing schemata can be implemented as RAGs. Our experience is that the RAG approach allows timing schemata to be implemented in a clear, concise, and modular manner.",

    "abstract": "Summary:  The lymphoid‐specific factors, recombination‐activating gene 1 (RAG1) and RAG2, initiate V(D)J recombination by introducing DNA double‐stand breaks at specific sites in the genome. In addition to this critical endonuclease activity, the RAG proteins catalyze other chemical reactions that can affect the outcome of V(D)J recombination, one of which is transposition. While the transposition activity of the RAG proteins is thought to have been critical for the evolution of modern antigen‐receptor loci, it has also been proposed to contribute to chromosomal translocations and lymphoid malignancy. A major challenge has been to determine how the transposition activity of the RAG proteins is regulated in vivo. Although a variety of mechanisms have been suggested by recent studies, a clear resolution of this issue remains elusive.",

    "abstract": "IL-4 and IL-13 are the only known activators of 15-lipoxygenase (LO) expression in cultured macrophages. To determine whether these lymphocyte-derived cytokines regulate 15-LO expression in vivo, the abundance of the murine homologue (12/15-LO) was assessed in peritoneal macrophages from immune-deficient strains of mice. Macrophages were harvested from recombinase activator gene (RAG)-2-/- mice that do not develop mature lymphocytes and cannot secrete activation-dependent cytokines. Unexpectedly, 12/15-LO protein and activity were significantly increased in peritoneal macrophages from RAG-2-/- mice compared with strain-matched controls. This increase was related to phenotypic differences between cells from RAG-2+/+ and RAG-2-/- mice. After 3 h in culture, RAG-2+/+ macrophages were of two distinct sizes, with only the larger cells immunostaining for 12/15-LO. However, all RAG-2-/- cells were distributed in the large size range, and all were immunoreactive for the enzyme. The activation of 12/15-LO expression appears to be related to prolonged residence within the peritoneum, since there were fewer resident peritoneal macrophages in RAG-2-/- than in RAG-2+/+ mice, and newly recruited macrophages elicited by the administration of Sephacryl to RAG-2-/- mice did not immunostain for 12/15-LO. To determine whether 12/15-LO expression was due to IL-4 or IL-13 from nonlymphoid cells, the abundance of the enzyme was quantified in peritoneal macrophages from STAT6-/-mice that have attenuated responses to both cytokines. STAT6 deficiency did not influence the abundance of the protein in macrophages. Therefore, neither IL-4 nor IL-13 secretion is a requirement for macrophage 15-LO expression in vivo.",

    "abstract": "Immune factors are involved in modulating neointimal response to arterial wall injury, but the role of individual immune effectors in this response remains unclear. Using a carotid cuff injury model in mice, we tested the role of immunoglobulin isotypes in modulating intimal thickening by using adoptive transfer of splenocytes from WT mice, or the direct administration of IgG or IgM into immune-deficient Rag-1-/- [Rag-1 knockout (Rag-1KO)] mice. The direct role of complement was also tested by depletion of complement. Splenocytes from WT mice were isolated and adoptively transferred to Rag-1KO mice subjected to carotid cuff arterial injury. Transfer of splenocytes to Rag-1KO mice resulted in increased serum IgM and IgG within 48 h and were comparable to WT levels by 21 days after injury. Splenocyte transfer in Rag-1KO decreased intimal area by 40% compared with Rag-1KO mice without cell transfer. To further differentiate the relative contribution of IgM or IgG in reducing intimal thickening, additional groups of Rag-1KO mice were subjected to injury and given intravenous injections of pooled mouse IgG or IgM. Both IgG and IgM treatment significantly reduced intimal thickening compared with untreated Rag-1KO mice. Immunoglobulin treatments modified serum complement C3 profile and decreased C3 presence in injured arteries. Depletion of C3 using cobra venom factor in Rag-1KO mice significantly decreased intimal thickening. Our results identify the direct role of natural IgG and IgM, and complement in the modulation of neointimal response to arterial injury.",

In this review, we examine the progress that has been made toward understanding the regulatory mechanisms that prohibit transposition in order to formulate a model that takes into account the diverse observations that have been made over the last 15 years. First, we touch on the striking mechanistic similarities between transposition and V(D)J recombination and review evidence suggesting that the RAG proteins may be members of the retroviral integrase superfamily. We then dispense with an old theory that certain standard products of V(D)J recombination called signal joints protect against deleterious transposition events. Finally, we discuss the evidence that target capture could serve a regulatory role and close with an analysis of hairpins as preferred targets for RAG‐mediated transposition. These novel strategies for harnessing the RAG transposase not only shed light on V(D)J recombination but also may provide insight into the regulation of other transposases.",

Thus, the i.v. administration of OA-PEG and RAG-PEG conjugates into mice did not elicit antibodies to OA and RAG, respectively, and these conjugates were shown to suppress in an immunologically specific manner the capacity of these animals to mount primary as well as secondary IgE responses to sensitizing doses of dinitrophenylated OA or of RAG. Moreover, the Peg-modified antigens did not combine either in vitro or in vivo with IgE antibodies directed against the natural antigens. Hence, OA-PEG and RAG-PEG conjugates were incapable of triggering allergic reactions in animals possessing IgE antibodies to the unmodified antigens. These PEG-modified antigens were also shown to be tolerogenic.",

    "abstract": "Summary. The factor VIII coagulant activity (FVIII :C), factor VIII related antigen (FVIII: RAG), and factor VIII ristocetin cofactor activity (FVIII :RCF) was determined in the cord blood samples of 30 healthy term newborns. Sodium citrate anticoagulant, cold, and a proteolytic inhibitor were used in sample processing. All three factor VIII activities were elevated in infants compared to adults; additionally, FVIII: RAG was significantly higher in vaginally compared with caesarean section delivered infants. Crossed immunoelectrophoresis of the term infant plasma showed a consistently normal factor VIII mobility. An additional group of 22 sick premature and term infants had determinations of factor VIII antigen and crossed immunoelectrophoresis. The FVIII: RAG of sick infants was approximately twice that of the well term infants. Infants with severe lung disease, asphyxia, thrombosis and sepsis had normal electrophoretic mobility despite marked elevations in FVIII: RAG. Abnormal, symmetrical, more anodal migrations were seen only in a group of severely ill newborns with dessiminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) or signs of activated fibrinolysis. These results suggest that the elevated FVIII activities seen in well infants and most sick newborns are the result of increased release of a normal form of the FVIII molecule. Those elevations seen in sick newborns with DIC result from increased release and the production of an altered, faster moving FVIII molecule.",

    "abstract": "Antibody and T cell receptor genes are assembled from gene segments by V(D)J recombination to produce an almost infinitely diverse repertoire of antigen specificities. Recombination is initiated by cleavage of conserved recombination signal sequences (RSS) by RAG1 and RAG2 during lymphocyte development. Recent evidence demonstrates that recombination can occur at noncanonical RSS sites within Ig genes or at other loci, outside the context of normal lymphocyte receptor gene rearrangement. We have characterized the ability of the RAG proteins to bind and cleave a cryptic RSS (cRSS) located within an Ig VH gene segment. The RAG proteins bound with sequence specificity to either the consensus RSS or the cRSS. The RAG proteins nick the cRSS on both the top and bottom strands, thereby bypassing the formation of the DNA hairpin intermediate observed in RAG cleavage of canonical RSS substrates. We propose that the RAG proteins may utilize an alternative mechanism for double-stranded DNA cleavage, depending on the substrate sequence. These results have implications for further diversification of the antigen receptor repertoire as well as the role of the RAG proteins in genomic instability.",

However, when we isolated cells from rabbit thoracic aorta (after collagenase treatment and gentle scraping of the intima) and examined them with immunoperoxidase techniques, we observed two cell types which stained specifically for either F8-RAg or ACE, but not both. Each cell type was morphologically distinguishable in primary culture. F8-RAg-positive cells were recognizable in distinct patches as more elongated, tightly apposed, and firmly adherent cells; they exhibited only faint or no staining for ACE and no accumulation of a fluorescent, acetylated low-density lipoprotein probe (Dil-Ac-LDL), another endothelial cell marker. In contrast, ACE-positive cells were more rounded, less closely apposed, and grew as strict monolayers that exhibited a characteristic cobblestone appearance at confluence; ACE-positive cells were F8-RAg negative, but demonstrated intense labeling with Dil-Ac-LDL. Subcultures of ACE-positive cells were also stained by anti-rabbit thrombomodulin.",

However, they can sense # as a kind of context. In this paper, we investigate this #-sensing ability. and study the language generating power of RAGs. Making good use of this ability, We show a method for RAGs to sense the contexts of local shapes of a host array in a derivation. Using this method, we give RAGs which generate the sets of all solid upright rectangles and all solid squares. On the other hand. it is proved that there is no context-free array grammar (and thus no RAG) which generates the set of all hollow upright rectangles.",

Although the concentration of radiolabelled metabolites decreased with time, RAG predominated at nearly all times in nearly all tissues. Small amounts of retinoic acid (RA) were also universally present, together with unidentified polar metabolites and small amounts of non-polar esters of RA. The major excretion products of RAG in faeces and urine were RA and polar metabolites. Thus RAG, although converted in part to RA in vivo, persists as a major component in blood and tissues for at least 24 h.

    "abstract": "Recombination activating genes, RAG-1 and RAG-2, encode proteins that catalyze the rearrangement of immunoglobulin genes in B cells and T cell receptor genes in T cells to generate the diversity of these important recognition molecules in immune system. It has been believed that these gene rearrangements occur exclusively in premature stages of B and T lymphocytes, consistent with the observation that RAG expression is downregulated in mature lymphocytes. However, recent studies have revealed that even mature B cells in peripheral lymphoid tissues can reexpress RAG-1 and RAG-2 proteins following immunization. Strikingly, RAG-expressing B cells are localized in the germinal centers (GCs) of secondary lymphoid tissues in which somatic hypermutations, isotype switching, and affinity maturation of antibodies take place. Recently, it has been shown that RAG proteins thus induced are functional and can mediate the secondary rearrangement of Ig genes (receptor editing) at mature stages of B cells. Evidence is accumulating suggesting that GCs are regarded as a primary lymphoid tissue. In the present review, we briefly summarize recent advances in the expression and the characterization of RAG proteins and discuss their possible role in mature B cells in relation to the diversification and the selection of B cell repertoire in GCs.",

    "abstract": "Formalin‐fixed, paraffin‐embedded material from 15 haemangioendotheliosarcomas and eight malignant haemangiopericytomas was stained with an immunohistochemical technique for the presence of factor VIII‐related antigen (F VIII‐RAg), actin, laminin and for reactivity with the lectin Ulex europaeus I (UEA‐I). Haemangioendotheliosarcomas stained with both F VIII‐RAg and UEA‐1; however, UEA‐I was found to be the more sensitive of the two, reacting also with the poorly differentiated tumours. Haemangiopericytomas reacted negatively with UEA‐I; surprisingly, some of these tumours exhibited a weak positivity in staining for F VIII‐RAg, possibly supporting the theory about intermediate forms between haemangioendotheliosarcomas and haemangiopericytomas. Laminin was found in most of the haemangioendotheliosarcomas and was useful in illustrating their vascular growth pattern. Haemangiopericytomas also reacted positively for laminin, but the intensity of staining was less pronounced. Positive staining for actin was demonstrated in both tumour types.",

    "title": "All-trans-retinoyl-beta-glucuronide is a potent teratogen in the mouse because of extensive metabolism to all-trans-retinoic acid.",
    "abstract": "All-trans-retinoyl-beta-D-glucuronide (all-trans-RAG) is a water-soluble derivative of all-trans-retinoic acid (all-trans-RA) and has been characterized as an endogenous metabolite of vitamin A in rat bile and kidney. All-trans-RAG was previously demonstrated to be a major metabolite after application of all-trans-RA in several species (mouse, rat, rabbit, monkey); all-trans-RAG was described in these experiments to exhibit a very low placental transfer to the embryo. Because retinoid-like activity has been found after application of all-trans-RAG in vivo as well as in several in vitro systems, and because of its low placental transfer, this glycoconjugate appeared to be an interesting retinoid with possible therapeutic activity, but reduced teratogenicity. Here we investigated the teratogenic activity of all-trans-RAG in comparison to all-trans-RA in mice, and performed accompanying pharmacokinetic studies. Surprisingly, all-trans-RAG was more teratogenic than equimolar doses of all-trans-RA following subcutaneous application on day 11 of gestation in the mouse (20 mumol/kg body weight). Pharmacokinetic studies revealed that all-trans-RAG was extensively hydrolyzed to all-trans-RA and that the plasma area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) of all-trans-RA following all-trans-RAG application exceeded the plasma AUC value of all-trans-RA following application of all-trans-RA. Extensive hydrolysis of all-trans-RAG was also observed after intravenous application of this glycoconjugate. Transfer of all-trans-RAG to the embryo was low, but transfer was high to maternal organs such as the liver and kidney. These in vivo studies suggest that all-trans-RAG serves as a precursor of all-trans-RA by the intravenous and subcutaneous routes, and application of all-trans-RAG results in high and teratogenic in vivo exposure to all-trans-RA.",

    "title": "Retinoid signaling by all-trans retinoic acid and all-trans retinoyl-beta-D-glucuronide is attenuated by simultaneous exposure of human keratinocytes to retinol.",
    "abstract": "Retinol and retinyl esters are converted with time to slowly increasing amounts of all-trans retinoic acid (RA) in cultured human keratinocytes. Exogenous RA has been shown to limit retinol oxidation and to increase retinol esterification. Because significant amounts of retinol are present in biologic systems, we examined whether RA and all-trans-retinoyl-beta-D-glucuronide (RAG) interact with retinol in exhibiting their activities on HaCaT keratinocytes maintained in a retinoid-free culture system. RA was more potent than RAG and retinol in inducing ultrastructural changes attributed to retinoids, inhibiting cell proliferation as well as enhancing keratin 19 expression. In addition, retinoids were able to induce cellular retinoic acid-binding protein II mRNA levels in the cultures, whereas early RA and late RAG activity was detected. The described biologic effects of RA and RAG were diminished by simultaneous cell exposure to retinol. HaCaT cells quickly metabolized retinol to retinyl esters and consequently to low amounts of RA. RA treatment led to an early high peak of cellular RA followed by reduction to trace amounts. Treatment with RAG resulted in constantly high cellular RAG and low RA levels. Under the combined RA and retinol treatment retinyl esters were increased and RA was reduced in HaCaT cells, whereas extracellular RA levels were similar to those obtained by RA alone. On the other hand, the combination of RAG and retinol resulted in higher extracellular RAG, similar cellular RAG, and lower cellular RA levels than those obtained by RAG alone without any change in retinyl esters. This study demonstrates that retinoid signaling by RA and RAG is attenuated by simultaneous exposure of HaCaT keratinocytes in vitro to retinol. The presence of retinol in the medium alters the rate of RA or RAG metabolism and thus cellular RA concentrations. The intensity of retinoid signal is probably dependent on cellular RA levels. The resulting \"antagonism\" among retinoids is consistent with the presence of an auto-regulatory mechanism in human keratinocytes offering protection against excessive accumulation of cellular RA.",

Numbers of peritoneal B-1 cells and Ig-producing cells were negligible in the T cell-deficient HL mice generated by the cross with RAG-2-/- mice (RAG-2-/- x HL mice). Proliferation and activation of B-1 cells in RAG-2-/- x HL mice were recovered by fetal thymus transfer, indicating involvement of T cells in B-1 cell-mediated autoimmune hemolytic anemia. Involvement of T cells in proliferation and activation of B-1 cells could be by-passed by administration of lipopolysaccharide (LPS), IL-5 or IL-10 to RAG-2-/- x HL mice. Administration of LPS elevated the serum IL-10 level in HL, RAG-2-/- x HL and normal mice. Proliferation and activation of B-1 cells were blocked by an anti-IL-10 antibody in conventionally bred as well as LPS-treated HL mice. Taken together, IL-10 plays a pivotal role in activation of peritoneal B-1 cells.",

The SCC-RAG titers were significantly high in three patients with invasive SCC in whom primary tumors were either comparatively large or were associated with metastatic lesions, while they remained within the normal limit in patients with smaller-sized, nonmetastatic SCC, Bowen's disease, other non-SCC dermatoses, and in normal control subjects. The SCC-RAG titers, therefore, provided a useful tumor marker for cutaneous SCC, particularly in advanced stages. In such cases, the values were clearly correlated with tumor behaviors in response to or against treatments and with the development of metastasis.",

    "abstract": "The recombination activating gene, RAG-1, which is supposed to encode a molecule regulating V(D)J recombination, has been isolated. In the current study, the distribution of RAG-1 expression in human neoplastic hematopoietic cells was compared with the phenotypic and genotypic status of differentiation. Thirty-one hematopoietic cell lines (16 B-lineage, 9 T-lineage, 2 Hodgkin's disease, and 4 nonlymphoid cell lines) were investigated for the expression of human RAG-1 using the reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). RAG-1 was not expressed in nonlymphoid, Hodgkin's disease, or mature-stage lymphoid cell lines, but was present in some acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL)/lymphoblastic lymphoma (LBL) cell lines. The investigation was extended to 45 cases of fresh ALL/LBL cells. The patterns of RAG-1 expression found in the cell lines and fresh ALL/LBL cells were similar. In B-lineage cells, the product of RAG-1 RT-PCR was detected in CD19+ CD10- CD20- CD5- stage (stage II, Nadler's classification) and was at the highest level in CD19+ CD10+ CD20- CD5- stage (stage III), but was absent or limited in CD19+ CD10+ CD20-+ CD5- (stage IV) or CD19+ CD10+ (or CD10-) CD5+. In stage II, monoclonal gene rearrangements of only the immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgH) were found, whereas monoclonal gene rearrangements of both IgH and T-cell receptor (TCR)-beta chain were frequently noted in stages III and IV. The expression of CD20 or CD5 antigen apparently correlated with the decline of RAG-1 expression. In T-lineage cells, RAG-1 was highly expressed in CD3- CD4+ CD8+/CD3+ CD4+ CD8+ thymic stages, but was negative or only weakly expressed in the CD3- CD4- CD8- prothymic or early thymic stage, in which the TCR-beta gene was often germline, or the CD3+ CD4+ CD8- mature thymic stage. The relative levels of RAG-1 mRNA give an additional delineating frame to the schemes of lymphoid differentiation based on phenotypic and genotypic status. RAG-1 is exhibited by cells of the thymic stage capable of synthesizing TCR or expressing it on the cell surface. The weak or absent expression of RAG-1 in the prothymic or early thymic stage suggests that the contribution of RAG-1 to the gene rearrangement may differ quantitatively between TCR-delta/TCR-gamma and TCR-beta.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",

    "abstract": "This study assayed serum levels of FVIII Rag as a marker of endothelial injury in patients not only with frank connective tissue disease but also in those presenting with Raynaud's phenomenon and in families of those with systemic sclerosis. Elevated levels of FVIII Rag were found in 62% of patients with systemic sclerosis (SS), 38% with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), 67% with mixed connective tissue disease (MCTD) and in 17% with primary Raynaud's phenomenon. Twenty per cent of first degree relatives of patients with SS also demonstrated high levels of FVIII Rag and certain antibodies, namely those reacting with U1RNP and the centromere. The association between elevated FVIII Rag and antibodies linked to Raynaud's and vasculitis lends support to antibody involvement in pathogenesis. High levels of FVIII Rag in family members may reflect an increased susceptibility of endothelium to injury particularly since relatives also have a higher frequency of clinical features such as Raynaud's phenomenon.",

    "abstract": "Emulsan, the extracellular polyanionic emulsifying agent produced by Acinetobacter calcoaceticus RAG-1, has been implicated as a receptor for a specific virulent RAG-1 bacteriophage, ap3. Aqueous solutions of emulsan did not interfere with phage ap3 adsorption to RAG-1 cells. However, binding of phage ap3 occurred at the interfaces of hexadecane-in-water emulsions specifically stabilized by emulsan polymers. Binding of ap3 to emulsions was inhibited either in the presence of anti-emulsan antibodies or in the presence of a specific emulsan depolymerase. Moreover, when the phage was first bound to emulsan-stabilized emulsions and the emulsions subsequently treated with emulsan depolymerase, viable phage was released, indicating that phage ap3 DNA ejection was not triggered by binding. The results indicate that emulsan functions as the ap3 receptor and suggest that to function as a receptor, emulsan assumes a specific conformation conferred on it by its specific interaction with hydrophobic surfaces.",

    "title": "Immature T cells in peripheral lymphoid organs of recombinase-activating gene-1/-2-deficient mice. Thymus dependence and responsiveness to anti-CD3 epsilon antibody.",
    "abstract": "Thymocytes of mice deficient in the recombinase-activating gene (RAG)-1 or RAG-2 cannot express and receive signals through the pre-TCR. As a result, thymocyte development in these mice terminates at the CD4/8 double negative (DN), IL-2R-alpha-positive stage. Nevertheless, RAG-deficient DN thymocytes express functional CD3 complexes and can therefore be induced by anti-CD3 epsilon mAb to mature to the CD4+8+ double positive stage. In the present paper we demonstrate that the peripheral lymphoid organs (lymph nodes, spleen) and peripheral blood of RAG-deficient mice harbor an immature T cell population which, similar to RAG-deficient DN thymocytes, contains high levels of cytoplasmic CD3 epsilon and responds to anti-CD3 epsilon mAb in vivo. With respect to surface phenotype (Thy1.2+, PgP-1+, HSA+, Fc gamma RII/III-, IL-2R-alpha-, c-kit-), these cells are similar to intermediate stage RAG-deficient DN thymocytes. Moreover, they express mRNA for pre-TCR-alpha and for the nondeleted RAG. Following injection of anti-CD3 epsilon mAb, these cells proliferate, down-regulate heat stable Ag and PgP-1, and partially differentiate to CD4+ and CD8+ double positive and single positive cells. The induced population displays a mixed phenotype, between that of immature thymocytes and lymph node T cells in normal mice. Induction is successful in thymectomized RAG-deficient mice, suggesting that it occurs in the periphery. However, after thymectomy, inducible cells disappear with an approximate half-life of 10 to 14 days. We suggest that DN thymocytes can emigrate and repopulate peripheral lymphoid organs of RAG-deficient mice. These cells respond to CD3 signaling by aberrant maturation, possibly due to the inappropriate microenvironment of peripheral lymphoid organs.",

    "abstract": "It has been reported that a small population of peripheral T lymphocytes are capable of expressing V(D)J recombinase and initiating secondary V(D)J rearrangements. To determine whether RAG‐expression and secondary TCR gene recombination in peripheral T cells are an antigen‐driven process in secondary lymphoid tissues, we examined naive CD4+ T cells, activated/memory CD4+ T cells, and germinal center T cells from human tonsils. Our results showed that low levels of RAG‐1 and RAG‐2 mRNA were present in all T cell subpopulations except CD3+/CD4– T cells. LM‐PCR analyses for double‐strand DNA breaks showed that all the T cell subsets expressing RAG genes contain double‐strand signal break ends, indicating ongoing TCR gene recombination. Continued RAG gene expression, introducing and repairing of double‐strand DNA breaks at the TCR loci in the periphery may have significant implications in the development of some T cell neoplasms.",

The effects studied included antioxidant levels in plasma and the liver, oxidative damage of lipids represented by the formation of substances reacting with thiobarbituric acid (TBARP) and selected biochemical indicators. The administration of RAG did not significantly affect antioxidant status of diabetic rats or hemoglobin glycation and plasma concentration of fructosamine. In diabetic rats, application of RAG decreased formation of TBARP in plasma but not in the liver. Moderate steatosis of liver and increased plasma levels of triacylglycerols in diabetic rats were significantly improved by application of RAG.",

    "title": "Up-regulation of recombination activating gene expression by signal transduction through the surface Ig receptor.",
    "abstract": "Recent evidence has demonstrated that a signal transduced through the lymphocyte Ag receptor may regulate the expression of the recombination activating genes (RAG). Although several groups have shown that such a signal may be required to down-regulate RAG-1 and RAG-2 after a functional Ag receptor has been generated in early mature T or B cells, recently it has been suggested that under some circumstances, cross-linking the B cell Ag receptor may result in up-regulation of RAG expression. To study this possibility, we used a unique set of cell variants isolated from a human mature B cell line, which differ in their expression of both the surface Ig receptor (sIg) and RAG-1 and RAG-2 genes. Two forms of stimulation were employed to generate a signal; either a soluble F(ab')2 anti-mu fragment or the combination of PMA and ionomycin. Northern blot analysis demonstrated that RAG-1 mRNA levels were increased in sIg+ variants after cross-linking with anti-mu. Increases were also observed in all variants after stimulation with PMA and ionomycin. Further analysis of cross-linked sIg+ variants suggests that the observed up-regulation in RAG expression was a reversible event. Furthermore, we have determined that both increased transcription and transcript stabilization contributed to this inducible up-regulation. We thus describe a mature B cell line in which RAG expression is up-regulated after sIg cross-linking. This finding is discussed in the context of its potential role in situations where sIg+ B cells may undergo secondary rearrangements for the purpose of \"editing\" their sIg receptors.",

    "title": "Microbial Degradation of Crude Oil: Factors Affecting the Dispersion in Sea Water by Mixed and Pure Cultures",
    "abstract": "By means of the enrichment culture technique, a mixed population of microorganisms was obtained which catalyzed the dispersion of crude oil in supplemented sea water. From this enrichment culture, eight pure cultures were isolated and studied. Only one of the isolates (RAG-1) brought about a significant dispersion of crude oil. RAG-1 has been tentatively characterized as a member of the genus Arthrobacter. The other seven isolates gave rise to colonies on supplemented oil agar, but were neither able to disperse oil nor to stimulate the dispersion catalyzed by RAG-1. The dispersion of crude oil by either RAG-1 or the enrichment culture was absolutely dependent on exogenous sources of nitrogen and phosphorous and completely inhibited by 10−2m azide. The increase in cell number of RAG-1 was directly proportional to the concentration of crude oil added to the medium over the range 0.05 to 1.0 mg/ml. Within this linear region, 1.0 mg of crude oil yielded 9 × 107 cells and approximately 65% of the oil was converted into a nonbenzene extractable form. Accompanying the emulsification was a decrease in the pH from 7.6 to 5.0. Acidic conditions, however, were neither necessary nor sufficient for oil dispersion. When sea water was supplemented with 0.029 mm K2HPO4 and 3.8 mm (NH4)2SO4 and inoculated with RAG-1, oil dispersion occurred within 1 day. This dispersion could also be brought about by the supernatant following separation of the cells from the medium. Similarly, the supernatant obtained following growth of RAG-1 on hexadecane was capable of emulsifying crude oil in 60 min.",

Information is sought with regard to the probable permanence of such papers after about 150 years. The three answers given to this inquiry are more or less in agreement that rag-content papers made with high alpha pulps to approach the permanence of 100% rag papers are not commercially available and if prepared to such high standards, will not allow a significant price differential. Since purified wood pulps are of comparatively recent origin, nobody has yet had experience with their keeping qualities after 150 years, whereas high-grade, glue-sized, all-rag papers have stood the test of time for even longer periods. In addition, handling and storage conditions must be taken into account; acid environments can be very damaging to any paper, but all-rag papers undoubtedly suffer least under such conditions. -- AATA",

Wolfson et al. identified a biochemical sensor of leucine, Sestrin2, which connects the concentration of leucine to the control of organismal metabolism and growth. When leucine bound to Sestrin2, it was released from a complex with the mTORC1 regulatory factor GATOR2, activating the mTORC1 complex. Saxton et al. describe the crystal structure of Sestrin2 and show how it specifically detects leucine. Aylett et al. determined the structure of human mTORC1 by cryoelectron microscopy and the crystal structure of a regulatory subunit, Raptor. The results reveal the structural basis for the function and intricate regulation of this important enzyme, which is also a strategic drug target. Science, this issue p. 43, p. 48, p. 53; see also p. 25 A protein that senses leucine concentration for metabolic control is identified. [Also see Perspective by Buel and Blenis] Leucine is a proteogenic amino acid that also regulates many aspects of mammalian physiology, in large part by activating the mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) protein kinase, a master growth controller. Amino acids signal to mTORC1 through the Rag guanosine triphosphatases (GTPases). Several factors regulate the Rags, including GATOR1, aGTPase-activating protein; GATOR2, a positive regulator of unknown function; and Sestrin2, a GATOR2-interacting protein that inhibits mTORC1 signaling. We find that leucine, but not arginine, disrupts the Sestrin2-GATOR2 interaction by binding to Sestrin2 with a dissociation constant of 20 micromolar, which is the leucine concentration that half-maximally activates mTORC1. The leucine-binding capacity of Sestrin2 is required for leucine to activate mTORC1 in cells. These results indicate that Sestrin2 is a leucine sensor for the mTORC1 pathway.",

    "title": "Lysosomal amino acid transporter SLC38A9 signals arginine sufficiency to mTORC1",
    "abstract": "Sensing amino acids at the lysosome The mTORC1 protein kinase is a complex of proteins that functions to regulate growth and metabolism. Activity of mTORC1 is sensitive to the abundance of amino acids, but how the sensing of amino acids is coupled to the control of mTORC1 has been unclear. Wang et al. searched for predicted membrane proteins that interacted with regulators of mTORC1. They identified a protein currently known only as SLC38A9. Interaction of SLC38A9 with mTORC1 regulators was sensitive to the presence of amino acids. SLC38A9 has sequence similarity to amino acid transporters. Effects of modulation of SLC38A9 in cultured human cells indicate that it may be the sensor that connects the abundance of arginine and leucine to mTORC1 activity. Science, this issue p. 188 A possible sensor for detecting and signaling amino acid abundance is identified. [Also see Perspective by Abraham] The mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) protein kinase is a master growth regulator that responds to multiple environmental cues. Amino acids stimulate, in a Rag-, Ragulator-, and vacuolar adenosine triphosphatase–dependent fashion, the translocation of mTORC1 to the lysosomal surface, where it interacts with its activator Rheb. Here, we identify SLC38A9, an uncharacterized protein with sequence similarity to amino acid transporters, as a lysosomal transmembrane protein that interacts with the Rag guanosine triphosphatases (GTPases) and Ragulator in an amino acid–sensitive fashion. SLC38A9 transports arginine with a high Michaelis constant, and loss of SLC38A9 represses mTORC1 activation by amino acids, particularly arginine. Overexpression of SLC38A9 or just its Ragulator-binding domain makes mTORC1 signaling insensitive to amino acid starvation but not to Rag activity. Thus, SLC38A9 functions upstream of the Rag GTPases and is an excellent candidate for being an arginine sensor for the mTORC1 pathway.",

    "title": "Vaccination with early ferroptotic cancer cells induces efficient antitumor immunity",
    "abstract": "Background Immunotherapy represents the future of clinical cancer treatment. The type of cancer cell death determines the antitumor immune response and thereby contributes to the efficacy of anticancer therapy and long-term survival of patients. Induction of immunogenic apoptosis or necroptosis in cancer cells does activate antitumor immunity, but resistance to these cell death modalities is common. Therefore, it is of great importance to find other ways to kill tumor cells. Recently, ferroptosis has been identified as a novel, iron-dependent form of regulated cell death but whether ferroptotic cancer cells are immunogenic is unknown. Methods Ferroptotic cell death in murine fibrosarcoma MCA205 or glioma GL261 cells was induced by RAS-selective lethal 3 and ferroptosis was analyzed by flow cytometry, atomic force and confocal microscopy. ATP and high-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) release were detected by luminescence and ELISA assays, respectively. Immunogenicity in vitro was analyzed by coculturing of ferroptotic cancer cells with bone-marrow derived dendritic cells (BMDCs) and rate of phagocytosis and activation/maturation of BMDCs (CD11c+CD86+, CD11c+CD40+, CD11c+MHCII+, IL-6, RNAseq analysis). The tumor prophylactic vaccination model in immune-competent and immune compromised (Rag-2−/−) mice was used to analyze ferroptosis immunogenicity. Results Ferroptosis can be induced in cancer cells by inhibition of glutathione peroxidase 4, as evidenced by confocal and atomic force microscopy and inhibitors’ analysis. We demonstrate for the first time that ferroptosis is immunogenic in vitro and in vivo. Early, but not late, ferroptotic cells promote the phenotypic maturation of BMDCs and elicit a vaccination-like effect in immune-competent mice but not in Rag-2−/− mice, suggesting that the mechanism of immunogenicity is very tightly regulated by the adaptive immune system and is time dependent. Also, ATP and HMGB1, the best-characterized damage-associated molecular patterns involved in immunogenic cell death, have proven to be passively released along the timeline of ferroptosis and act as immunogenic signal associated with the immunogenicity of early ferroptotic cancer cells. Conclusions These results pave the way for the development of new therapeutic strategies for cancers based on induction of ferroptosis, and thus broadens the current concept of immunogenic cell death and opens the door for the development of new strategies in cancer immunotherapy.",

    "abstract": "This study shows that the normal thymus produces immunoregulatory CD25+4+8- thymocytes capable of controlling self-reactive T cells. Transfer of thymocyte suspensions depleted of CD25+4+8- thymocytes, which constitute approximately 5% of steroid-resistant mature CD4+8- thymocytes in normal naive mice, produces various autoimmune diseases in syngeneic athymic nude mice. These CD25+4+8- thymocytes are nonproliferative (anergic) to TCR stimulation in vitro, but potently suppress the proliferation of other CD4+8- or CD4-8+ thymocytes; breakage of their anergic state in vitro by high doses of IL-2 or anti-CD28 Ab simultaneously abrogates their suppressive activity; and transfer of such suppression-abrogated thymocyte suspensions produces autoimmune disease in nude mice. These immunoregulatory CD25+4+8- thymocytes/T cells are functionally distinct from activated CD25+4+ T cells derived from CD25-4+ thymocytes/T cells in that the latter scarcely exhibits suppressive activity in vitro, although both CD25+4+ populations express a similar profile of cell surface markers. Furthermore, the CD25+4+8- thymocytes appear to acquire their anergic and suppressive property through the thymic selection process, since TCR transgenic mice develop similar anergic/suppressive CD25+4+8- thymocytes and CD25+4+ T cells that predominantly express TCRs utilizing endogenous alpha-chains, but RAG-2-deficient TCR transgenic mice do not. These results taken together indicate that anergic/suppressive CD25+4+8- thymocytes and peripheral T cells in normal naive mice may constitute a common T cell lineage functionally and developmentally distinct from other T cells, and that production of this unique immunoregulatory T cell population can be another key function of the thymus in maintaining immunologic self-tolerance.",

    "title": "The adaptive immune system restrains Alzheimer’s disease pathogenesis by modulating microglial function",
    "abstract": "Significance Neuroinflammation and activation of innate immunity are pathological hallmarks of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). In contrast, very few studies have examined the impact of the adaptive immune system in AD pathogenesis. Here, we find that genetic ablation of peripheral immune cell populations significantly accelerates amyloid pathogenesis, worsens neuroinflammation, and alters microglial activation state. Critically, it appears that loss of IgG-producing B cells impairs microglial phagocytosis, thereby exacerbating amyloid deposition. Conversely, replacement of IgGs via direct injection or bone marrow transplantation reverses these effects and reduces Aβ pathology. Together, these results highlight the importance of the adaptive immune system and its interactions with microglia in the pathogenesis of AD. The innate immune system is strongly implicated in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). In contrast, the role of adaptive immunity in AD remains largely unknown. However, numerous clinical trials are testing vaccination strategies for AD, suggesting that T and B cells play a pivotal role in this disease. To test the hypothesis that adaptive immunity influences AD pathogenesis, we generated an immune-deficient AD mouse model that lacks T, B, and natural killer (NK) cells. The resulting “Rag-5xfAD” mice exhibit a greater than twofold increase in β-amyloid (Aβ) pathology. Gene expression analysis of the brain implicates altered innate and adaptive immune pathways, including changes in cytokine/chemokine signaling and decreased Ig-mediated processes. Neuroinflammation is also greatly exacerbated in Rag-5xfAD mice as indicated by a shift in microglial phenotype, increased cytokine production, and reduced phagocytic capacity. In contrast, immune-intact 5xfAD mice exhibit elevated levels of nonamyloid reactive IgGs in association with microglia, and treatment of Rag-5xfAD mice or microglial cells with preimmune IgG enhances Aβ clearance. Last, we performed bone marrow transplantation studies in Rag-5xfAD mice, revealing that replacement of these missing adaptive immune populations can dramatically reduce AD pathology. Taken together, these data strongly suggest that adaptive immune cell populations play an important role in restraining AD pathology. In contrast, depletion of B cells and their appropriate activation by T cells leads to a loss of adaptive–innate immunity cross talk and accelerated disease progression.",

    "title": "Safety-II in Practice: Developing the Resilience Potentials",
    "abstract": "Safety-I is defined as the freedom from unacceptable harm. The purpose of traditional safety management is therefore to find ways to ensure this ‘freedom’. But as socio-technical systems steadily have become larger and less tractable, this has become harder to do. Resilience engineering pointed out from the very beginning that resilient performance an organisation’s ability to function as required under expected and unexpected conditions alike – required more than the prevention of incidents and accidents. This developed into a new interpretation of safety (Safety-II) and consequently a new form of safety management. Safety-II changes safety management from protective safety and a focus on how things can go wrong, to productive safety and a focus on how things can and do go well. For Safety-II the aim is not just the elimination of hazards and the prevention of failures and malfunctions but also how best to develop an organisation’s potentials for resilient performance – the way it responds, monitors, learns, and anticipates. That requires models and methods that go beyond the Safety-I toolbox. This book introduces a comprehensive approach for the management of Safety-II, called the Resilience Assessment Grid (RAG). It explains the principles of the RAG and how it can be used to develop the resilience potentials. The RAG provides four interdependent sets of diagnostic and formative questions that can be tailored to any organisation. The questions are based on the principles of resilience engineering and backed by practical experience from several domains.",

    "abstract": "The discovery of mutations in DEPDC5 in familial focal epilepsies has introduced a novel pathomechanism to a field so far dominated by ion channelopathies. DEPDC5 is part of a complex named GAP activity toward RAGs (GATOR) complex 1 (GATOR1), together with the proteins NPRL2 and NPRL3, and acts to inhibit the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) complex 1 (mTORC1) pathway. GATOR1 is in turn inhibited by the GATOR2 complex. The mTORC1 pathway is a major signaling cascade regulating cell growth, proliferation, and migration. We aimed to study the contribution of GATOR complex genes to the etiology of focal epilepsies and to describe the associated phenotypical spectrum.",

    "title": "Thermochromic Lead‐Free Halide Double Perovskites",
    "abstract": "Lead‐free halide double perovskites with diverse electronic structures and optical responses, as well as superior material stability show great promise for a range of optoelectronic applications. However, their large bandgaps limit their applications in the visible light range such as solar cells. In this work, an efficient temperature‐derived bandgap modulation, that is, an exotic fully reversible thermochromism in both single crystals and thin films of Cs2AgBiBr6 double perovskites is demonstrated. Along with the thermochromism, temperature‐dependent changes in the bond lengths of AgBr (RAgBr) and BiBr (RBiBr) are observed. The first‐principle molecular dynamics simulations reveal substantial anharmonic fluctuations of the RAgBr and RBiBr at high temperatures. The synergy of anharmonic fluctuations and associated electron–phonon coupling, and the peculiar spin–orbit coupling effect, is responsible for the thermochromism. In addition, the intrinsic bandgap of Cs2AgBiBr6 shows negligible changes after repeated heating/cooling cycles under ambient conditions, indicating excellent thermal and environmental stability. This work demonstrates a stable thermochromic lead‐free double perovskite that has great potential in the applications of smart windows and temperature sensors. Moreover, the findings on the structure modulation‐induced bandgap narrowing of Cs2AgBiBr6 provide new insights for the further development of optoelectronic devices based on the lead‐free halide double perovskites.",

    "title": "Amino acid regulation of TOR complex 1.",
    "abstract": "TOR complex 1 (TORC1), an oligomer of the mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) protein kinase, its substrate binding subunit raptor, and the polypeptide Lst8/GbetaL, controls cell growth in all eukaryotes in response to nutrient availability and in metazoans to insulin and growth factors, energy status, and stress conditions. This review focuses on the biochemical mechanisms that regulate mTORC1 kinase activity, with special emphasis on mTORC1 regulation by amino acids. The dominant positive regulator of mTORC1 is the GTP-charged form of the ras-like GTPase Rheb. Insulin, growth factors, and a variety of cellular stressors regulate mTORC1 by controlling Rheb GTP charging through modulating the activity of the tuberous sclerosis complex, the Rheb GTPase activating protein. In contrast, amino acids, especially leucine, regulate mTORC1 by controlling the ability of Rheb-GTP to activate mTORC1. Rheb binds directly to mTOR, an interaction that appears to be essential for mTORC1 activation. In addition, Rheb-GTP stimulates phospholipase D1 to generate phosphatidic acid, a positive effector of mTORC1 activation, and binds to the mTOR inhibitor FKBP38, to displace it from mTOR. The contribution of Rheb's regulation of PL-D1 and FKBP38 to mTORC1 activation, relative to Rheb's direct binding to mTOR, remains to be fully defined. The rag GTPases, functioning as obligatory heterodimers, are also required for amino acid regulation of mTORC1. As with amino acid deficiency, however, the inhibitory effect of rag depletion on mTORC1 can be overcome by Rheb overexpression, whereas Rheb depletion obviates rag's ability to activate mTORC1. The rag heterodimer interacts directly with mTORC1 and may direct mTORC1 to the Rheb-containing vesicular compartment in response to amino acid sufficiency, enabling Rheb-GTP activation of mTORC1. The type III phosphatidylinositol kinase also participates in amino acid-dependent mTORC1 activation, although the site of action of its product, 3'OH-phosphatidylinositol, in this process is unclear.",

    "title": "Moral Outrage Mediates the Dampening Effect of System Justification on Support for Redistributive Social Policies",
    "abstract": "To understand how and why people tolerate ongoing social and economic inequality, we conducted two studies investigating the hypothesis that system justification is associated with reduced emotional distress and a lack of support for helping the disadvantaged. In Study 1, we found that the endorsement of a system-justifying ideology was negatively associated with moral outrage, existential guilt, and support for helping the disadvantaged. In Study 2, the induction of a system-justification mind-set through exposure to “rags-to-riches” narratives decreased moral outrage, negative affect, and therefore intentions to help the disadvantaged. In both studies, moral outrage (outward-focused distress) was found to mediate the dampening effect of system justification on support for redistribution, whereas existential guilt (Study 1) or negative affect in general (Study 2; inward-focused distress) did not. Thus, system-justifying ideology appears to undercut the redistribution of social and economic resources by alleviating moral outrage.",

    "abstract": "We examine intergenerational occupational mobility in India among males using the Indian Human Development Survey survey of 2011-12. Our analysis differs from previous work in two important respects. First, we use a finer-grained categorisation that takes into account differences in skill levels across different occupations as well as their place in India’s social hierarchy of labour. Second, we examine both sharp and moderate occupational ascents and descents – that is, both large and not-so-large movements up or down the social status ladder. We compare India with historical occupational mobility elsewhere and examine how such ascents and descents are linked to social identity and urban location. We find that vast differences exist in the upward mobility prospects of urban versus rural residents and upper-caste Hindus versus Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes. Simultaneously, the prospects for downward mobility are large in India, larger among rural residents and among Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes. We also find striking parallels between upward mobility prospects and sharp descent risks in India and China",

    "title": "Ku70-deficient embryonic stem cells have increased ionizing radiosensitivity, defective DNA end-binding activity, and inability to support V(D)J recombination.",
    "abstract": "V(D)J recombination requires both lymphoid-specific and generally expressed enzymatic activities. All three known generally expressed activities involved in V(D)J recombination are also involved in DNA double-strand break repair (DSBR). Two of these are components of the DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) and include Ku80 and DNA-PK catalytic subunit (DNA-PKcs); the third, XRCC4, is a protein of unknown function. The Ku70 protein is an additional component of DNA-PK; Ku70 forms a heterodimer with Ku80 to generate the DNA end-binding component of the enzyme. To test putative functions for Ku70, we have used gene-targeted mutation to generate a murine embryonic stem cell line which lacks Ku70 expression. We find that the Ku70(-/-) cells produce no detectable Ku70 and very little Ku80, suggesting a direct interrelationship between their levels. Correspondingly, these cells lack the nonspecific DNA end-binding activity associated with Ku. Significantly, the Ku70(-/-) embryonic stem cells have markedly increased sensitivity to gamma-irradiation relative to Ku70(+/-) or wild-type embryonic stem cells. Furthermore, the Ku70(-/-) cells lack the ability to effectively rejoin signal and coding ends liberated in transiently introduced V(D)J recombination substrates by enforced RAG-1 and RAG-2 expression. We conclude that the Ku70 gene product is involved in DSBR and V(D)J recombination and confirm that the Ku70 gene can be classified as a member of the x-ray cross-complementation group 6 (XRCC6). Potential differences between the Ku70(-/-) and Ku80(-/-) V(D)J recombination defects are discussed.",

    "title": "RAGS TO RAGS: Poverty and Mobility in the United States",
    "abstract": "Early arguments over the “culture of poverty” assumed considerable intergenerational transmission of poverty but differed over whether this was due to cultural inadequacies of the poor or to structural barriers and discrimination faced by the poor. These arguments subsided by the 1970s when quantitative social stratification studies such as Blau & Duncan (1967) found that intergenerational socioeconomic mobility was considerable and that there was little evidence for a “vicious cycle of poverty.” In the 1980s the issue of intergenerational poverty reemerged when research on new longitudinal datasets suggested that both intragenerational and intergenerational poverty were more persistent than analyses based on cross-sectional data had suggested. Four new theoretical perspectives were developed to explain intergenerational poverty: the resources model, the correlated disadvantages model, the welfare culture model, and Wilson’s (1987) underclass model. This review summarizes and evaluates recent empirical re...",

    "abstract": "The BCR-ABL1 fusion gene defines the subgroup of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) with the worst clinical prognosis. To identify oncogenic lesions that combine with BCR-ABL1 to cause ALL, we used Affymetrix Genome-Wide Human SNP arrays (250K NspI and SNP 6.0), fluorescence in situ hybridization, and genomic polymerase chain reaction to study 106 cases of adult BCR-ABL1-positive ALL. The most frequent somatic copy number alteration was a focal deletion on 7p12 of IKZF1, which encodes the transcription factor Ikaros and was identified in 80 (75%) of 106 patients. Different patterns of deletions occurred, but the most frequent were those characterized by a loss of exons 4 through 7 (Delta4-7) and by removal of exons 2 through 7 (Delta2-7). A variable number of nucleotides (patient specific) were inserted at the conjunction and maintained with fidelity at the time of relapse. The extent of the Delta4-7 deletion correlated with the expression of a dominant-negative isoform with cytoplasmic localization and oncogenic activity, whereas the Delta2-7 deletion resulted in a transcript lacking the translation start site. The IKZF1 deletion also was identified in the progression of chronic myeloid leukemia to lymphoid blast crisis (66%) but never in myeloid blast crisis or chronic-phase chronic myeloid leukemia or in patients with acute myeloid leukemia. Known DNA sequences and structural features were mapped along the breakpoint cluster regions, including heptamer recombination signal sequences recognized by RAG enzymes during V(D)J recombination, suggesting that IKZF1 deletions could arise from aberrant RAG-mediated recombination.",

    "abstract": "In sepsis there is extensive apoptosis of lymphocytes, which may be beneficial by down-regulating the accompanying inflammation. Alternatively, apoptosis may be detrimental by impairing host defense. We studied whether Bcl-2, a potent antiapoptotic protein, could prevent lymphocyte apoptosis in a clinically relevant model of sepsis. Transgenic mice in which Bcl-2 was overexpressed in T cells had complete protection against sepsis-induced T lymphocyte apoptosis in thymus and spleen. Surprisingly, there was also a decrease in splenic B cell apoptosis in septic Bcl-2 overexpressors compared with septic HeJ and HeOuJ mice. There were marked increases in TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, and IL-10 in thymic tissue in sepsis in the three species of mice, and the increase in TNF-alpha and IL-10 in HeOuJ mice was greater than that in Bcl-2 mice. Mitotracker, a mitochondrial membrane potential indicator, demonstrated a sepsis-induced loss of membrane potential in T cells in HeJ and HeOuJ mice but not in Bcl-2 mice. Importantly, Bcl-2 overexpressors also had improved survival in sepsis. To investigate the potential impact of loss of lymphocytes on survival in sepsis, Rag-1-/- mice, which are totally deficient in mature T and B cells, were also studied. Rag-1-/- mice had decreased survival compared with immunologically normal mice with sepsis. We conclude that overexpression of Bcl-2 provides protection against cell death in sepsis. Lymphocyte death may be detrimental in sepsis by compromising host defense.",

In respiration they burn organic materials to carbon dioxide and water; in fermentation they split glucose to lactic acid. All tumors so far tested behave fundamentally alike. There is no essential difference between the cancer cells of transplanted rat tumors and spontaneous tumors, sarcoma and carcinoma cells, and the tar carcinoma, and Rous sarcoma produced by filtrate. The fermentation of tumors was first found with cut pieces of tumor in vitro. I C. and G. Cori 2 demonstrated it in living animals as well. They determined the glucose and lactic acid in the axillary veins of hens having in one wing a Rous sarcoma, and found in 100 cc. of blood 23 mg. less glucose and 16 rag. more lactic acid on the tumor side than on the normal side. A corresponding experiment with a human fore-arm tumor showed in 100 cc. of blood 12 rag. less glucose and 9 rag. more lactic acid on the tumor side. In experiments on the nourishment of tumors through the blood stream, we, like Cori, determined the glucose and lactic acid in tumor veins. Our procedure differed from Cori's in that we compared tumor veins and arteries, not tumor veins and corresponding normal veins. Our differences were greater than Cori's because we went closer to",

    "title": "Complement drives Th17 cell differentiation and triggers autoimmune arthritis",
    "abstract": "Activation of serum complement triggers Th17 cell–dependent spontaneous autoimmune disease in an animal model. In genetically autoimmune-prone SKG mice, administration of mannan or β-glucan, both of which activate serum complement, evoked Th17 cell–mediated chronic autoimmune arthritis. C5a, a chief component of complement activation produced via all three complement pathways (i.e., lectin, classical, and alternative), stimulated tissue-resident macrophages, but not dendritic cells, to produce inflammatory cytokines including IL-6, in synergy with Toll-like receptor signaling or, notably, granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF). GM-CSF secreted by activated T cells indeed enhanced in vitro IL-6 production by C5a-stimulated macrophages. In vivo, C5a receptor (C5aR) deficiency in SKG mice inhibited the differentiation/expansion of Th17 cells after mannan or β-glucan treatment, and consequently suppressed the development of arthritis. Transfer of SKG T cells induced Th17 cell differentiation/expansion and produced arthritis in C5aR-sufficient recombination activating gene (RAG)−/− mice but not in C5aR-deficient RAG−/− recipients. In vivo macrophage depletion also inhibited disease development in SKG mice. Collectively, the data suggest that complement activation by exogenous or endogenous stimulation can initiate Th17 cell differentiation and expansion in certain autoimmune diseases and presumably in microbial infections. Blockade of C5aR may thus be beneficial for controlling Th17-mediated inflammation and autoimmune disease.",

    "title": "Tumor-derived TGF-β Mediates Conversion of CD4+Foxp3+ Regulatory T Cells in a Murine Model of Pancreas Cancer",
    "abstract": "CD4+25+Foxp3+ regulatory T cells (Treg) play a critical role in the induction of tolerance to tumor-associated antigens and suppression of antitumor immunity. How Treg are induced in cancer is poorly understood. We reported previously that Treg are significantly elevated in the peripheral blood of patients with pancreas cancer and that in a murine pancreas cancer model induction of Treg seems to be transforming growth factor (TGF)-β dependent. Here we provide additional evidence that Treg are increased locally within the tumor microenvironment by a mechanism that seems dependent on TGF-β receptor expression and the presence of tumor derived TGF-β. The murine pancreas cancer cell line Pan02 produces high levels of TGF-β both in vitro and in vivo. In contrast, the esophageal murine cancer cell line, Eso2, does not. Immunohistochemical staining of Foxp3 in explanted tumors shows an identifiable population of Treg in the Pan02 (TGF-β positive) tumors but not Eso2 (TGF-β negative). Naive CD4+25−Foxp3− T cells, when adoptively transferred into Rag−/− mice, are converted into Foxp3+ Treg in the presence of Pan02 but not Eso2 tumors. Induction of Treg in Pan02 mice is blocked by systemic injection of an anti–TGF-β antibody. If Rag−/− mice are instead reconstituted with naive CD4+25− T cells expressing a mutated TGF-β receptor, induction of Foxp3+ Treg in Pan02 bearing mice is blocked. Collectively, these observations further support the role of TGF-β in the induction of Treg in pancreas adenocarcinoma.",

    "title": "Massive Stochastic Testing of SQL",
    "abstract": "Deterministic testing of SQL database systems is human intensive and cannot adequately cover the SQL input domain. A system (RAGS), was built to stochastically generate valid SQL statements 1 million times faster than a human and execute them. 1 Testing SQL is Hard Good test coverage for commercial SQL database systems is very hard. The input domain, all SQL statements, from any number of users, combined with all states of the database, is gigantic. It is also difficult to verify output for positive tests because the semantics of SQL are complicated.’ Software engineering technology exists to predictably improve quality ([Bei90] for example). The techniques involve a software development process including unit tests and final system validation tests (to verify the absence of bugs). This process requires a substantial investment so commercial SQL vendors with tight schedules tend to use a more ad hoc process. The most popular method’ is rapid development followed by test-repair cycles. SQL test groups focus on deterministic testing to cover individual features of the language. Typical SQL test libraries contain tens of thousands of statements and require an estimated % person-hour per statement to compose. These test libraries cover an important, but tiny, fraction of the SQL input domain. Large increases in test coverage must come from automating the generation of tests. This paper describes a method to rapidly create a very large number of SQL statements without human intervention. The SQL statements are generated stochastically (or ‘randomly’) which provides the speed as well as wider coverage of the input domain.

If the distribution is adequate, stochastic testing has the advantage that the quality of the tests improves as the test size increases [TFW93]. A system called RAGS (Random Generation of SQL) was built to explore automated testing. RAGS is currently used by the Microsoft SQL Server [MSS98] testing group. This paper describes RAGS and some illustrative test results. Figure 1 illustrates the test coverage problem.

    "title": "Tonal hierarchies in the music of north India.",
    "abstract": "Cross-culturally, most music is tonal in the sense that one particular tone, called the tonic, provides a focus around which the other tones are organized. The specific organizational structures around the tonic show considerable diversity. Previous studies of the perceptual response to Western tonal music have shown that listeners familiar with this musical tradition have internalized a great deal about its underlying organization. Krumhansl and Shepard (1979) developed a probe tone method for quantifying the perceived hierarchy of stability of tones. When applied to Western tonal contexts, the measured hierarchies were found to be consistent with music-theoretic accounts. In the present study, the probe tone method was used to quantify the perceived hierarchy of tones of North Indian music. Indian music is tonal and has many features in common with Western music. One of the most significant differences is that the primary means of expressing tonality in Indian music is through melody, whereas in Western music it is through harmony (the use of chords). Indian music is based on a standard set of melodic forms (called rags), which are themselves built on a large set of scales (thats). The tones within a rag are thought to be organized in a hierarchy of importance. Probe tone ratings were given by Indian and Western listeners in the context of 10 North Indian rags. These ratings confirmed the predicted hierarchical ordering. Both groups of listeners gave the highest ratings to the tonic and the fifth degree of the scale. These tones are considered by Indian music theorists to be structurally significant, as they are immovable tones around which the scale system is constructed, and they are sounded continuously in the drone. Relatively high ratings were also given to the vadi tone, which is designated for each rag and is given emphasis in the melody. The ratings of both groups of listeners generally reflected the pattern of tone durations in the musical contexts. This result suggests that the distribution of tones in music is a psychologically effective means of conveying the tonal hierarchy to listeners whether they are familiar with the musical tradition. Beyond this, only the Indian listeners were sensitive to the scales (thats) underlying the rags. For Indian listeners, multidimensional scaling of the correlations between the rating profiles recovered the theoretical representation of scales described by theorists of Indian music.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",

    "title": "Role of Myc Proto-Oncogene as a Transcriptional Hub to Regulate the Expression of Regeneration-Associated Genes following Preconditioning Peripheral Nerve Injury",
    "abstract": "Preconditioning peripheral nerve injury enhances the intrinsic growth capacity of DRGs sensory axons by inducing transcriptional upregulation of the regeneration-associated genes (RAGs). However, it is still unclear how preconditioning injury leads to the orchestrated induction of many RAGs. The present study identified Myc proto-oncogene as a transcriptional hub gene to regulate the expression of a distinct subset of RAGs in DRGs following the preconditioning injury. We demonstrated that c-MYC bound to the promoters of certain RAGs, such as Jun, Atf3, and Sprr1a, and that Myc upregulation following SNI preceded that of the RAGs bound by c-MYC. Marked DNA methylation of the Myc exon 3 sequences was implicated in the early transcriptional activation and accompanied by open histone marks. Myc deletion led to a decrease in the injury-induced expression of a distinct subset of RAGs, which were highly overlapped with the list of RAGs that were upregulated by Myc overexpression. Following dorsal hemisection spinal cord injury in female rats, Myc overexpression in DRGs significantly prevented the retraction of the sensory axons in a manner dependent on its downstream RAG, June. Our results suggest that Myc plays a critical role in axon regeneration via its transcriptional activity to regulate the expression of a spectrum of downstream RAGs and subsequent effector molecules. Identification of more upstream hub transcription factors and the epigenetic mechanisms specific for individual hub transcription factors would advance our understanding of how the preconditioning injury induces orchestrated upregulation of RAGs.",

    "abstract": "Entrepreneurial activity differs substantially across countries. While cultural differences across countries have often been proposed as an explanation, measuring a country's cultural characteristics suffers from various problems. This paper offers new evidence on the relative importance of cultural and institutional determinants of economic activity. In order to test the hypothesis that cultural factors influence entrepreneurial behavior, we observe differences in self-employment rates between immigrant groups within the same market. This approach allows holding constant the institutional environment. Using U.S. Census data for the year 2000, we find significant differences in the propensity to become self-employed across immigrants from 148 countries which is in line with previous findings. However, previous studies could not relate self-employment rates in the U.S. to self-employment shares in the immigrants' home-countries, contradicting a cultural explanation. We improve over the existing literature by additionally accounting for determinants of self-employment in the immigrants' home countries. We find evidence of a significantly positive relationship between self-employment rates of U.S. immigrants and entrepreneurial activity in their respective countries of origin that is robust to the inclusion of further variables, including institutions. We also find, however, a significant influence of home-country institutions on differences in immigrant activities. Our findings suggest that cultural factors (measured as behavioral persistence) are to some degree an expression of the behavior acquired under different institutional environments.",

Conventional biographical narratives construct a token “Oprah” persona whose life story resonates with and reinforces the ideology of the American Dream, implying the accessibility of this dream to black Americans despite the structural economic and political barriers posed in a racist society to achievement and survival. The article develops theories of tokenism, biography, autobiography, and hegemony to analyze both racial and gendered dimensions of tokenist biography. It describes tokenism as a rhetorical mechanism of liberal hegemony with regard to race and class. The essay challenges recent redefinitions of hegemony as happy “concordance” and suggests that critics cannot assume that black stars and texts automatically represent difference and resistance in popular culture.",

    "abstract": "Background Endometrium acquires structural and functional competence for embryo implantation only during the receptive phase of menstrual cycle in fertile women. Sizeable data are available to indicate that this ability is acquired by modulation in the expression of several genes/gene products. However, there exists little consensus on the identity, number of expressed/not-detected genes and their pattern of expression (up or down regulation). Methods Literature search was carried out to retrieve the data on endometrial expression of genes/proteins in various conditions. Data were compiled to generate a comprehensive database, Human Gene Expression Endometrial Receptivity database (HGEx-ERdb). The database was used to identify the Receptivity Associated Genes (RAGs) which display the similar pattern of expression across different investigations. Transcript levels of select RAGs encoding cell adhesion proteins were compared between two human endometrial epithelial cell lines; RL95-2 and HEC-1-A by quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction (q-RT-PCR). Further select RAGs were investigated for their expression in pre-receptive (n = 4) and receptive phase (n = 4) human endometrial tissues by immunohistochemical studies. JAr spheroid attachment assays were carried out to assess the functional significance of two RAGs. Results HGEx-ERdb (http://resource.ibab.ac.in/HGEx-ERdb/) helped identification of 179 RAGs, of which 151 genes were consistently expressed and upregulated and 28 consistently not-detected and downregulated in receptive phase as compared to pre-receptive phase. q-RT-PCR confirmed significantly higher (p<0.005) expression of Thrombospondin1 (THBS1), CD36 and Mucin 16 transcripts, in RL95-2 as compared to HEC-1-A. Further, the pretreatment with antibodies against CD36 and COMP led to a reduction in the percentage of JAr spheroids attached to RL95-2. Immunohistochemical studies demonstrated significantly higher (p<0.05) expression of endometrial THBS1, Cartilage Oligomeric Matrix Protein (COMP) and CD36 in the receptive phase as compared to pre-receptive phase human endometrial tissues. Conclusion HGEx-ERdb is a catalogue of 19,285 genes, reported for their expression in human endometrium. Further 179 genes were identified as the RAGs. Expression analysis of some RAGs validated the utility of approach employed in creation of HGEx-ERdb. Studies aimed towards defining the specific functions of RAGs and their potential networks may yield relevant information about the major ‘nodes’ which regulate endometrial receptivity.",

    "abstract": "Background: The inability to up-regulate “regeneration-associated genes” contributes to the failure of axonal regeneration after injury. Results: Expression of activated CREB and cAMP up-regulation co-regulate AP1-dependent regeneration-associated gene expression and enhance axon growth. Conclusion: Targeting transcription factor activity and the associated second messengers facilitates regenerative growth. Significance: This transcription factor plus small molecule approach may be an efficient means to stimulate axon regeneration. To regenerate damaged axons, neurons must express a cassette of regeneration-associated genes (RAGs) that increases intrinsic growth capacity and confers resistance to extrinsic inhibitory cues. Here we show that dibutyrl-cAMP or forskolin combined with constitutive-active CREB are superior to either agent alone in driving neurite growth on permissive and inhibitory substrates. Of the RAGs examined, only arginase 1 (Arg1) expression correlated with the increased neurite growth induced by the cAMP/CREB combination, both of which were AP1-dependent. This suggests that cAMP-induced AP1 activity is necessary and interacts with CREB to drive expression of RAGs relevant for regeneration and demonstrates that combining a small molecule (cAMP) with an activated transcription factor (CREB) stimulates the gene expression necessary to enhance axonal regeneration.",

    "abstract": "In addition to the assembled coding regions of immunoglobulin and T-cell receptor (TCR) genes, the V(D)J recombination reaction can in principle generate three types of by-products in normal developing lymphocytes: broken DNA molecules that terminate in a recombination signal sequence or a coding region (termed signal or coding end molecules, respectively) and DNA molecules containing fused recombination signal sequences (termed reciprocal products). Using a quantitative Southern blot analysis of the murine TCR alpha locus, we demonstrate that substantial amounts of signal end molecules and reciprocal products, but not coding end molecules, exist in thymocytes, while peripheral T cells contain substantial amounts of reciprocal products. At the 5' end of the J alpha locus, 20% of thymus DNA exists as signal end molecules. An additional 30 to 40% of the TCR alpha/delta locus exists as remarkably stable reciprocal products throughout T-cell development, with the consequence that the TCR C delta region is substantially retained in alpha beta committed T cells. The disappearance of the broken DNA molecules occurs in the same developmental transition as termination of expression of the recombination activating genes, RAG-1 and RAG-2. These findings raise important questions concerning the mechanism of V(D)J recombination and the maintenance of genome integrity during lymphoid development.",

Coordinate expression of RAG1 and RAG2 in B and T cells was found to be regulated by distinct genetic elements found on the 5' side of the RAG2 gene.

    "abstract": "Objective Interleukin (IL)-7 is mainly produced in bone marrow (BM) that forms the niche for B cells. We previously demonstrated that BM also retains pathogenic memory CD4 T cells in murine models of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). However, it remains unknown whether BM-derived IL-7 is sufficient for the development of IBD and which cells form the niche for colitogenic memory CD4 T cells in BM. Design To address these questions, we developed mice in which IL-7 expression was specific for BM, and identified colitis-associated IL-7-expressing mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) in the BM. Results IL-7–/–×RAG-1–/– mice injected with BM cells from IL-7+/+×RAG-1–/– mice, but not from IL-7–/–×RAG-1–/– mice, expressed IL-7 in BM, but not in their colon, and developed colitis when injected with CD4+CD45RBhigh T cells. Cultured BM MSC stably expressed a higher level of IL-7 than that of primary BM cells. IL-7-sufficient, but not IL-7-deficient, BM MSC supported upregulation of Bcl-2 in, and homeostatic proliferation of, colitogenic memory CD4 T cells in vitro. Notably, IL-7–/–×RAG-1–/– mice transplanted with IL-7-sufficient, but not IL-7-deficient, BM MSC expressed IL-7 in BM, but not in their colon, and developed colitis when transplanted with CD4+CD45RBhigh T cells. Conclusions We demonstrate for the first time that BM MSC are a major source of IL-7 and play a pathological role in IBD by forming the niche for colitogenic CD4 memory T cells in BM.",

    "abstract": "An enhanced, region-aided, geometric active contour that is more tolerant toward weak edges and noise in images is introduced. The proposed method integrates gradient flow forces with region constraints, composed of image region vector flow forces obtained through the diffusion of the region segmentation map. We refer to this as the region-aided geometric snake or RAGS. The diffused region forces can be generated from any reliable region segmentation technique, greylevel or color. This extra region force gives the snake a global complementary view of the boundary information within the image which, along with the local gradient flow, helps detect fuzzy boundaries and overcome noisy regions. The partial differential equation (PDE) resulting from this integration of image gradient flow and diffused region flow is implemented using a level set approach. We present various examples and also evaluate and compare the performance of RAGS on weak boundaries and noisy images.",

    "title": "New evidence for parallel evolution of colour patterns in Malagasy poison frogs (Mantella)",
    "abstract": "Malagasy poison frogs of the genus Mantella are diurnal and toxic amphibians of highly variable and largely aposematic coloration. Previous studies provided evidence for several instances of homoplastic colour evolution in this genus but were unable to sufficiently resolve relationships among major species groups or to clarify the phylogenetic position of several crucial taxa. Here, we provide cytochrome b data for 143 individuals of three species in the Mantella madagascariensis group, including four newly discovered populations. Three of these new populations are characterized by highly variable coloration and patterns but showed no conspicuous increase of haplotype diversity which would be expected under a scenario of secondary hybridization or admixture of chromatically uniform populations. Several populations of these variable forms and of M. crocea were geographically interspersed between the distribution areas of Mantella aurantiaca and Mantella milotympanum. This provides further support for the hypothesis that the largely similar uniformly orange colour of the last two species evolved in parallel. Phylogenies based on over 2000 bp of two nuclear genes (Rag‐1 and Rag‐2) identified reliably a clade of the Mantella betsileo and Mantella laevigata groups as sister lineage to the M. madagascariensis group, but did not support species within the latter group as monophyletic. The evolutionary history of these frogs might have been characterized by fast and recurrent evolution of colour patterns, possibly triggered by strong selection pressures and mimicry effects, being too complex to be represented by simple bifurcating models of phylogenetic reconstruction.",

    "title": "Starch Analysis in Food",
    "abstract": "Starch is quantitatively an important component of the human diet, being present in grains, tubers and legumes. Starch has for a long time been considered by many as being slowly but completely digested in the small intestine, resulting in modest glycemic responses and with no physiological role other than as an energy source. It is now understood that in fact the metabolic fate and physiological properties of starch can vary considerably, and both the botanical source and the effects of food processing are major determinants of starch digestibility. In addition to the nature of the starch itself, the site, rate and extent of digestion of starch in the human small intestine are influenced by a number of host factors. The rate at which starch is digested in the human small intestine results in a wide range of glycemic responses, and this physiological measurement has been used to rank foods by their glycemic index. In vitro studies have indicated that glycemic response and the rate of starch digestion are closely correlated. Rapidly digestible starch (RDS) and slowly digestible starch (SDS) fractions together represent the starch that is likely to be digested completely in the human small intestine, with any remaining starch defined as the resistant starch (RS) fraction that is available for fermentation in the large bowel. Measurements of RDS, SDS and RS can be obtained by one simple procedure. Values for the different starch fractions obtained by the in vitro method described here represent reproducible measurements that can be used to classify dietary starch according to its potential digestibility. In addition to these starch fractions, two terms, rapidly available glucose (RAG) and slowly available glucose (SAG), are introduced to reflect the rate at which glucose (from both sugars and starch) is likely to be absorbed in the small intestine. \n \n \n \nThe proportions of RAG, SAG, RDS, SDS and RS in foods can be controlled by food processing. The implications of altering the rate and extent of starch digestion are potentially of great importance to public health. A full understanding of the links between dietary carbohydrates and health and the underlying mechanisms will come only from the specific measurement of individual types of dietary carbohydrates.",

    "abstract": "This chapter is concerned with women working in the export-oriented readymade garment industry in Bangladesh. Although the majority of these women are located in what is officially classified as ‘the formal economy’, the nature of their contracts and their terms and conditions are more typical of work in the informal economy. Their situation illustrates the point made by a number of authors that the relationship between the ‘formal’ and ‘informal’ economy in much of the world, particularly the developing world, is a continuum rather than a dichotomy. What was traditionally described as ‘formal sector’ employment, characterized by written contracts, full-time work, permanent status and various forms of social benefits, accounts for an increasingly smaller share of total employment, while employment characterized by differing degrees of informality accounts for an increasing share (ILO, 2002; Lund and Srinivas, 2000; Standing, 1999). Clothing is a highly labour-intensive, low-technology product, the manufacture of which, along with textiles, has provided many countries of the world, including today’s advanced industrialized economies, with the first rung on their ladder to industrialization. While there has been diffusion of microelectronic equipment in the pre-assembly stages of grading, marking and cutting, the limpness of materials used in clothing has made mechanization in the labour-intensive assembly stage extremely difficult and, as long as there are plentiful supplies of cheap labour available, uneconomical. The global restructuring of the garment industry in recent decades is in part",

    "abstract": "Mature B cells can alter their antibody repertoires by several mechanisms, including immunoglobulin heavy chain variable region (VH) replacement. This process changes the antigen combining site by replacing a portion of the original VH/diversity/heavy chain joining region (VHDJH) rearrangement with a corresponding portion of a new VH segment. This exchange can involve cryptic heptamer-like sequences embedded in the coding regions of VH genes. While studying the B lymphocytes that expand in the synovial tissues of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), clones with VHDJH variants that were apparently generated by VH replacement were identified with surprising frequency (∼8%). Examples of multiple independent VH replacement events occurring in distinct progeny clones were also identified. These secondary VH rearrangements were documented at both the cDNA and genomic DNA levels and involved several heptamer-like sequences at four distinct locations within VH (three sites in framework region 3 and one in complementarity determining region 2). The identification of blunt-ended double-stranded DNA breaks at the embedded heptamers and the demonstration of recombinase activating gene (RAG) expression suggested that these rearrangements could occur in the synovial tissues, presumably in pseudo-germinal centers, and that they could be mediated by RAG in a recognition signal sequence–specific manner. The presence of VH mutations in the clones that had undergone replacement indicated that these B cells were immunocompetent and could receive and respond to diversification signals. A relationship between these secondary VH gene rearrangements and the autoimmunity characteristic of RA should be considered.",

    "title": "NF90 regulates inducible IL-2 gene expression in T cells",
    "abstract": "Activation of T cells induces the production of T cell growth and survival factor interleukin (IL) 2. Regulatory T cells intrinsically fail to induce IL-2 expression upon activation and can suppress IL-2 production in conventional T cells. Thus, the control of IL-2 expression is critically important to T cell immune responses, yet the mechanisms remain incompletely understood. Nuclear factor (NF) 90 is a zinc-finger DNA- and double-stranded RNA-binding protein subunit that binds specifically to the antigen receptor response element (ARRE)/NF of activated T cells target sequence in the IL-2 proximal promoter. Inducible binding of NF90 to the IL-2 promoter in vivo is shown by chromatin immunoprecipitation. NF90 gene-targeted mice exhibit perinatal lethality. Compared with newborn NF90+/+ mice, newborn NF90−/− mice demonstrate severe impairment of IL-2 expression. Compared with wild-type cells, T cells deficient in NF90 are impaired in ARRE and IL-2 transcriptional activation and IL-2 mRNA stabilization. Fetal liver cells from NF90 gene-targeted mice were transplanted into irradiated adult recombination activating gene (RAG)–2−/− and IL-2Rγ−/− mice deficient in T cells, B cells, and natural killer cells. NF90+/+- and NF90−/−-RAG chimeric mice showed grossly normal repopulation of the thymus and spleen, but only NF90−/− T cells were severely impaired in IL-2 gene expression. Compared with littermates, NF90−/− RAG chimeric mice exhibited profound T cell lymphocytopenia in the peripheral circulation. Thus, NF90 regulates inducible IL-2 transcription, mRNA stability, and gene expression in T cells and represents a novel therapeutic target for the modulation of T cell immune responses.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Objectives: To evaluate the potential effect of computer support on general practitioners' management of familial breast and ovarian cancer, and to compare the effectiveness of two different types of computer program. Design: Crossover experiment with balanced block design. Participants: Of a random sample of 100 general practitioners from Buckinghamshire who were invited, 41 agreed to participate. From these, 36 were selected for a fully balanced study. Interventions: Doctors managed 18 simulated cases: 6 with computerised decision support system Risk Assessment in Genetics (RAGs), 6 with Cyrillic (an established pedigree drawing program designed for clinical geneticists), and 6 with pen and paper. Main outcome measures: Number of appropriate management decisions made (maximum 6), mean time taken to reach a decision, number of pedigrees accurately drawn (maximum 6). Secondary measures were method of support preferred for particular aspects of managing family histories of cancer; importance of specific information on cancer genetics that might be provided by an “ideal computer program.” Results: RAGs resulted in significantly more appropriate management decisions (median 6) than either Cyrillic (median 3) or pen and paper (median 3); median difference between RAGs and Cyrillic 2.5 (95% confidence interval 2.0 to 3.0; P<0.0001). RAGs also resulted in significantly more accurate pedigrees (median 5) than both Cyrillic (median 3.5) and pen and paper (median 2); median difference between RAGs and Cyrillic 1.5 (1.0 to 2.0; P<0.0001). The time taken to use RAGs (median 178 seconds) was 51 seconds longer per case (95% confidence interval 36 to 65; P<0.0001) than pen and paper (median 124 seconds) but was less than Cyrillic (median 203 seconds; difference 23. (5 to 43; P=0.02)). 33 doctors (92% (78% to 98%)) preferred using RAGs overall. The most important elements of an “ideal computer program” for genetic advice in primary care were referral advice, the capacity to create pedigrees, and provision of evidence and explanations to support advice. Conclusions: RAGs could enable general practitioners to be more effective gatekeepers to genetics services, empowering them to reassure the majority of patients with a family history of breast and ovarian cancer who are not at increased genetic risk.",

    "title": "The Interleukin 7 Receptor Is Required for T Cell Receptor γ Locus Accessibility to the V(D)j Recombinase",
    "abstract": "Defects in the interleukin (IL)-7 signal transduction pathway lead to severe immunodeficiency in humans and in mice. In IL-7 receptor–deficient (IL-7R−/−) mice, lymphoid precursors show a reduced survival rate and variable/diversity/joining region V(D)J recombination is variously affected in different loci, being arrested in the T cell receptor (TCR)-γ locus, aberrant in the immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgH) locus, and delayed in the TCR-β locus. Here, we analyze the recombination defect of the TCR-γ locus. Using ligation-mediated polymerase chain reaction, we sought intermediates of the recombination process. In the absence of the IL-7 signal, no initiation of recombination of the TCR-γ locus was observed, whereas recombination intermediates at the TCR-β locus could be detected. Thus, the failure to rearrange the TCR-γ locus is due to a failure to initiate cleavage rather than a failure to religate broken DNA ends. V(D)J recombination was previously thought to begin at the pro-T2 stage of T cell development after the arrest of IL-7R−/− thymocytes at the pro-T1 stage. However, here we show that both TCR-γ and -β recombination intermediates are readily detectable in normal T1 cells, but only TCR-β intermediates were detected in IL-7R−/− T1 cells, supporting a mechanistic role for IL-7 in TCR-γ locus rearrangement. Since reduced recombination activating gene (rag) expression has been reported in the absence of the IL-7 signal, we directly tested whether the TCR-γ locus is accessible to cleavage by recombinant Rag proteins in vitro. We found a reduction in chromatin accessibility for Rag-mediated cleavage in IL-7R−/− thymocytes compared with wild-type. Thus, IL-7 controls recombination at the TCR-γ locus by regulating locus accessibility.",

    "title": "Epstein-Barr Virus LMP2A-Induced B-Cell Survival in Two Unique Classes of EμLMP2A Transgenic Mice",
    "abstract": "ABSTRACT Latent membrane protein 2A (LMP2A) is one of only two viral proteins expressed during latent Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infections in human peripheral B cells. LMP2A blocks B-cell receptor (BCR) signal transduction in vitro by modulation of the Syk and Lyn protein tyrosine kinases. Five genetically unique LMP2A transgenic mouse lines (EμLMP2A) with B-cell lineage expression of LMP2A were generated in this study to analyze the importance of LMP2A expression in vivo. These animals can be grouped into EμLMP2ABCR+ (TgB, Tg6, and TgC) and EμLMP2ABCR− (Tg7 and TgE) lines based on B-cell phenotype. LMP2A expression in bone marrow cells of EμLMP2ABCR− lines was associated with a bypass of normal B-lymphocyte developmental checkpoints inasmuch as immunoglobulin light-chain gene rearrangement occurred in the absence of complete immunoglobulin heavy-chain gene rearrangement. The resulting BCR-negative B cells were able to exit the bone marrow and colonize peripheral lymphoid organs. LMP2A expression in EμLMP2ABCR+ lines was not associated with altered B-cell development in a genetically wild-type background. When crossed into a recombinase activating null (RAG−/−) genetic background, LMP2A expression in either RAG−/−EμLMP2ABCR+ or RAG−/−EμLMP2ABCR− animals was able to provide a survival signal to BCR-negative splenic B cells. Additionally, bone marrow cells from all EμLMP2A animals were able to proliferate in response to interleukin-7-dependent developmental signals in vitro. These studies illustrate that LMP2A can provide a survival signal to BCR-negative B cells in two different groups of EμLMP2A transgenic mice.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nHigh-flow extracranial-intracranial (EC-IC) bypass is performed by using radial artery graphs (RAGs) or saphenous vein grafts (SVGs) for various pathologies such as aneurysms, ischemia, and skull-base tumors. Quantifying the acceptable amount of blood flow to maintain proper cerebral perfusion has not been well established, nor have the variables that influence flow been determined.\n\n\nOBJECTIVE\nTo identify the normative range of blood flow through extracranial-intracranial RAGs and SVGs as measured by duplex ultrasonography. Multiple variables were evaluated to better understand their influence of graft flow.\n\n\nMETHODS\nAll EC-IC grafts performed at Harborview Medical Center from 2005 to 2012 were retrospectively reviewed for this cohort study. Daily extracranial graft duplex ultrasonography with flow volumes and transcranial graft Doppler were examined, as were short- and long-term outcomes. Both ischemic and hyperemic events were evaluated in further detail.\n\n\nRESULTS\nEighty monitorable high-flow EC-IC bypasses were performed over the 8-year period. Sixty-five bypasses were performed by using RAGs and 15 were performed with SVGs. The average flow was 133 mL/min for RAGs and 160 mL/min for SVGs (P = .25). For both RAG and SVG groups, the donor and recipient vessel selected significantly impacted flow. For the RAG group only, preoperative graft diameter, postoperative hematocrit, and postoperative date significantly influenced flow. A 1-week average of >200 mL/min was 100% sensitive to cerebral hyperemia syndrome.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThis study establishes the normative range of duplex ultrasonographic flow after high-flow EC-IC bypass, as well the usefulness and practicality of such monitoring as a surrogate to flow in the postoperative period.",

    "abstract": "Purpose: To determine the in vivo expression of neurotrophins (NTs) and nerve regeneration-associated genes (RAGs) after surgically creating a hinged lamellar corneal flap in thy1-YFP mice. Methods: Lamellar corneal flaps with multiple hinges were created in thy1-YFP mice. Mice were killed at weeks 2, 4, and 8. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction was performed to determine the expression of NTs and RAGs in the corneas after lamellar transection. Nerve growth factor (Ngf), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (Bdnf), glial cell–derived neurotrophic factor (Gdnf), neurotrophin 3, neurotrophin 5, small proline–rich repeat protein 1A (Sprr1a), growth-associated protein 43 (Gap43), and beta III tubulin (Tubb3) gene expressions were analyzed. Whole-mount confocal immunofluorescence and Western analyses were performed for localization and abundance of robustly expressed genes. Results: Sprouts of fine YFP-positive fronds emanating from transected (injured) nerve bundles were seen in the flap area at 2 weeks onward. Bdnf and Sprr1a were robustly and significantly expressed at 2 weeks postoperatively (>2-fold increase in expression; P < 0.05). Bdnf localized to thy1-YFP+ cells in operated corneas. Sprr1a localized to corneal epithelial cell membranes. At 8 weeks, none of the NTs and RAGs had increased expression. Bdnf (&rgr; = 0.73, P = 0.001) and Sprr1a (&rgr; = 0.76, P = 0.001) showed a significant positive correlation with beta III tubulin. Conclusions: The neurotrophin Bdnf and RAG Sprr1a are robustly and significantly expressed during corneal nerve regeneration in vivo.",

The host response to primary infection is characterized by the induction of an acute inflammation, which is accompanied by polymorphonuclear cell (PMN) infiltration, resulting in massive destruction of the colonic mucosa. However, PMN play a major role in the recovery from primary infection, by restricting the bacterial infection at the intestinal mucosa. In this study, we assessed the roles for T and NK cells in the control of primary S. flexneri infection, using an alymphoid mouse strain (Rag°γc°) devoid of B, T, and NK cells. Using the mouse pulmonary model of Shigella infection, we showed that alymphoid Rag°γc° mice were highly susceptible to S. flexneri infection in comparison with wild-type (wt) mice. Whereas PMN recruitment upon infection was similar, macrophage recruitment and production of proinflammatory cytokines were significantly decreased in Rag°γc° mice compared with wt mice. Upon selective engraftment of Rag°γc° mice with polyclonal αβ T cells, but not with αβ T cells from IFN-γ°, S. flexneri infection could be subsequently controlled. Rag° mice devoid of B and T cells but harboring NK cells could control infection. Local IFN-γ production by T and NK cells recruited to the lung was demonstrated in S. flexneri-infected wt mice. These data demonstrate that both αβ T cells and NK cells contribute to the early control of S. flexneri infection through amplification of an inflammatory response. This cellular lymphocyte redundancy assures IFN-γ production, which is central to innate immunity against Shigella infection.",

    "title": "VDJ Recombination",
    "abstract": "Artemis is the newest player in VDJ recombination and double strand break repair. First identified in radiation-sensitive and immune-deficient patients, it was recently shown to interact with DNA-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit (DNA-PKcs) and have nuclease activity, becoming the most popular candidate for the opening of hairpin coding ends. Reports presented in this issue (1) and in the December issue of Molecular Cell (2) address the role of Artemis in vivo by studying the effect of its deletion on the generation of intermediates and products of VDJ recombination in mouse ES cells, MEFs, and thy-mocytes. In all three systems analyzed, a defect in coding joint formation was observed, which was highly dependent on the cellular background and included inefficient and partially defective opening of hairpin coding ends. In addition, Artemis-deficient ES cells and Artemis-deficient MEFs show spontaneous chromosomal abnormalities, including telomere fusions, indicating that Artemis is also required for maintenance of genomic stability. This commentary will focus on the results regarding the role of Artemis in VDJ recombination. VDJ recombination, also known as antigen receptor gene rearrangement, is the process that assembles the variable domain of immunoglobulin and TCR genes. The hallmark of this reaction is the production of a large repertoire of antigen receptors with different specificities, a characteristic that is essential to the normal functioning of the immune system. VDJ recombination is directed to the immunoglobulin and TCR loci by highly conserved recombination signal sequences (RSSs) comprised of a heptamer and a nonamer motif with an intervening 12-or 23-bp spacer. Efficient re-combination in vivo occurs almost exclusively between RSSs with different spacers, which is referred to as the 12/ 23 rule (3). Several proteins that mediate VDJ recombina-tion in vivo have been identified (4). The lymphoid-specific components of the recombination machinery are RAG-1, RAG-2, and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT). RAG-1 and RAG-2 together constitute the recombinase. TdT, although not essential for catalysis, plays an important role increasing diversity by mediating the incorporation of nontemplate-dependent nucleotides. The nonlymphoid-restricted components identified so far are DNA-PKcs, Ku70, Ku80, XRCC4, ligase 4, and the most recently identified Artemis. All these proteins are involved in DNA double strand break repair as well as VDJ recombination. These nonlymphoid-specific components are likely to participate in the processing and joining steps of VDJ recombination, but their specific architectural or catalytic roles in the reaction remain largely unclear. Two other nonlymphoid-specific components, HMG1 and HMG2, have been …",

    "title": "Kinetics of facial motoneuron loss following facial nerve transection in severe combined immunodeficient mice",
    "abstract": "We have recently shown that cells of the acquired immune system are crucial components of motoneuron survival after injury (Serpe et al. [1999] J. Neurosci. 19:RC7). The goal of the present study was to determine the kinetics of facial motoneuron (FMN) loss in wild‐type, scid, and reconstituted scid mice after a right facial nerve axotomy at the stylomastoid foramen. Scid mice showed a significant decrease in FMN survival at all weekly postoperative (wpo) times. One, two, four, and ten wpo, ipsilateral FMN survival in scid mice was 90% ± 1.8%, 84% ± 1.3%, 52% ± 3.7%, and 45% ± 2.5%, respectively, of the contralateral, unoperated side. In contrast, FMN loss after axotomy in wild‐type and reconstituted scid mice was not observed until 4 wpo (86% ± 2.5% and 83% ± 3.5%, respectively) relative to the contralateral, unoperated side. However, the levels of FMN in both wild‐type and reconstituted scid mice were significantly higher than those in the nonreconstituted scid at 4 wpo. By 10 wpo, FMN survival in both wild‐type and reconstituted scid mice had continued to decline significantly (60% ± 2.1% and 58% ± 3.1%, respectively) relative to the contralateral, unoperated side but were still significantly higher than that of the nonreconstituted scid at 10 wpo. Several important controls were also added to this study. Because the scid mutation is present in all cells (although it specifically results in a loss of V(D)J recombination mechanisms, we wanted to rule out the actual DNA mutation as causal in FMN loss). To accomplish this, we used the recombinase‐activating gene‐2 knockout (RAG‐2 KO) mouse model, in which the RAG‐2 has been disrupted and prevents maturation of T and B cells. As with the scid model, there was a significant loss of FMN at 4 wpo in the RAG‐2 KO that could be reversed with whole splenocyte reconstitution. We also compared FMN numbers in nonaxotomized facial nuclei from both scid and RAG‐2 KO mice relative to wild‐type controls. No differences in normal numbers of FMN were found in either the mutation or the gene knockout model. The ability of T and B lymphocytes to rescue FMN from cell death after peripheral nerve injury supports the hypothesis that cells of the acquired immune system produce neurotrophic factors or neurocytokines to support neuronal survival until target reconnection occurs.

    "abstract": "Chiroptera, the second largest mammalian order, presents different reproductive strategies and unique reproductive features. However, there are few reports regarding male reproductive accessory glands (RAGs) in Chiroptera. Thus, the aim of the present study was to characterise the RAGs of the exclusively neotropical bat Artibeus planirostris (Chiroptera: Phyllostomidae) macroscopically, microscopically and ultrastructurally. The RAGs were composed of a prostatic complex with two regions (ventral and dorsal) and paraurethral and bulbourethral glands, but no seminal vesicles. The ventral region had an undefined epithelium, with secretory and basal cells, and its secretions were periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) positive. The dorsal region received both deferens ducts, had a columnar pseudostratified epithelium with secretory and basal cells. There were two types of secretions from the dorsal region: one that was basophilic and another that was mixed PAS positive and PAS negative. The paraurethral glands were dispersed in the connective tissue of the urethra, whereas the bulbourethral glands were located in the penile root. Histological and ultrastructural data confirmed the prostatic nature of the ventral and dorsal regions and the holocrine nature of the ventral region, with the latter finding never having been described previously for the prostate gland. Our findings demonstrate the wide discrepancy of RAGs between A. planirostris and other mammals in terms of their composition, structure and morphology.",

    "abstract": "Structured document databases can be naturally viewed as derivation trees of a context-free grammar. Under this view, the classical formalism of attribute grammars becomes a formalism for structured document query languages. From this perspective, we study the expressive power of BAGs: Boolean-valued attribute grammars with propositional logic formulas as semantic rules, and RAGs: relation-valued attribute grammars with first-order logic formulas as semantic rules. BAGs can express only unary queries; RAGs can express queries of any arity. We first show that the (unary) queries expressible by BAGs are precisely those definable in monadic second-order logic. We then show that the queries expressible by RAGs are precisely those definable by first-order inductions of linear depth, or, equivalently, those computable in linear time on a parallel machine with polynomially many processors. Further, we show that RAGs that only use synthesized attributes are strictly weaker than RAGs that use both synthesized and inherited attributes. We show that RAGs are more expressive than monadic second-order logic for queries of any arity. Finally, we discuss relational attribute grammars in the context of BAGs and RAGs. We show that in the case of BAGs this does not increase the expressive power, while different semantics for relational RAGs capture the complexity classes NP, coNP and UP ∩ coUP.",

    "abstract": "Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic autoimmune disease that primarily attacks synovial joints. Despite the advances in diagnosis and treatment of RA, novel molecular targets are still needed to improve the accuracy of diagnosis and the therapeutic outcomes. Here, we present a systems approach that can effectively 1) identify core RA-associated genes (RAGs), 2) reconstruct RA-perturbed networks, and 3) select potential targets for diagnosis and treatments of RA. By integrating multiple gene expression datasets previously reported, we first identified 983 core RAGs that show RA dominant differential expression, compared to osteoarthritis (OA), in the multiple datasets. Using the core RAGs, we then reconstructed RA-perturbed networks that delineate key RA associated cellular processes and transcriptional regulation. The networks revealed that synovial fibroblasts play major roles in defining RA-perturbed processes, anti-TNF-α therapy restored many RA-perturbed processes, and 19 transcription factors (TFs) have major contribution to deregulation of the core RAGs in the RA-perturbed networks. Finally, we selected a list of potential molecular targets that can act as metrics or modulators of the RA-perturbed networks. Therefore, these network models identify a panel of potential targets that will serve as an important resource for the discovery of therapeutic targets and diagnostic markers, as well as providing novel insights into RA pathogenesis.",

    "title": "Synchronous expansion of intermediate TCR cells in the liver and uterus during pregnancy.",
    "abstract": "The immunophysiology of pregnancy was investigated in relation to how extra- and intrathymic pathways of T cell differentiation are modulated during pregnancy. Pregnancy was produced in syngeneic and allogeneic combinations in mice. In both cases, a prominent decrease in the number of thymocytes and a mild increase in the number of hepatic mononuclear cells (MNC) were induced during the periparturient period. The most striking change was the increase in the number of intermediate TCR cells with extrathymic T cell properties in the liver. When MNC yielded by the uterus were examined, an expansion of intermediate TCR cells was also observed in this organ during pregnancy. The major populations in the pregnant uterus were NK cells and intermediate TCR cells, the latter of which contained double-negative CD4-8- cells and consisted of both alpha beta and gamma delta T cells. All of these properties coincided with those of extrathymic T cells in the liver. Reflecting extrathymic T cell differentiation, MNC in the liver and pregnant uterus expressed mRNA of RAG-1 and RAG-2. To determine the role of hormonal regulation in this phenomenon, the effects of various pregnancy-associated hormones on thymocytes and hepatic MNC were examined in nonpregnant mice. Of the hormones tested, estrogen was found to induce a response similar to that seen in pregnant mice. These results suggest that a local immune response in the uterus during pregnancy is a phenomenon occurring synchronously with systemic immune systems.",

    "title": "Effect of lactate on FFA and glycerol turnover in resting and exercising dogs.",
    "abstract": "The rates of appearance of FFA (RaFFA) and that of glycerol (RaGLY) were measured simultaneously with [1-14 C]palmitate and [2-3H]-glycerol, in dogs with indwelling arterial and venous catheters. Lipolysis was stimulated by exercise (treadmill run on 10% slope) or by the infusion of norepinephrine (0.5 mug/kg-min). Na-L(+)-lactate (L), Na-pyruvate (Py), or Na-nicotinate (N) were infused. All three components decreased RaFFA. RaGLY was increased by L, unaltered by Py, and decreased by N. There was an inverse correlation (P less than 0.001) between the logarithms of RaFFA and plasma lactate. A linear correlation was obtained between RaGLY and plasma lactate when this latter was increased by the infusion of L. It is suggested that a) lactate in physiological concentrations inhibits the release of FFA stimulated by exercise and b) the increase of the NADH/NAD ratio leads to the formation of alpha-glycerophosphate which in turn yields glycerol. Therefore changes in plasma glycerol do not reflect lipolysis when blood lactate increases. c) The effect of lactate on RaFFA can be explained by an enhanced reesterification, although a direct inhibition on lipase could not be excluded.",

    "title": "RAGs: A Novel Approach to Computerized Genetic Risk Assessment and Decision Support from Pedigrees",
    "abstract": "Summary Objectives: To assist general practitioners in evaluating patients’ genetic risk of cancer on the basis of family history data. Methods: A new computer application, RAGs (Risk Assessment in Genetics), has been developed to help doctors create graphical family trees and assess the genetic risk of breast and colorectal cancer. RAGs possesses two features that distinguish it from similar software: (i) a user-centred design, which takes into account the requirements of the doctor-patient encounter; (ii) effective and accessible risk reporting by employing qualitative evidence for or against increased risk, which is more easily understood than numerical probabilities. The system allows any rule-based genetic risk guideline to be implemented, and may be readily modified to cater for the varying degrees of information required by different specialists. Results: RAGs permits fast, accurate data entry, and results in more appropriate management decisions than those made via other techniques. In addition, RAGs enables both the clinician and the patient to understand how it arrives at its conclusions, since the use of qualitative evidence allows the program to provide explanations for its reasoning. Conclusions: The RAGs system promises to help practitioners be more effective gatekeepers to genetic services. It may empower doctors both to make an informed choice when deciding to refer patients who are at increased genetic risk of breast or colorectal cancer, and to reassure those who are at low risk.",

    "title": "Epstein-Barr virus LMP2A-induced B-cell survival in two unique classes of EmuLMP2A transgenic mice.",
    "abstract": "Latent membrane protein 2A (LMP2A) is one of only two viral proteins expressed during latent Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infections in human peripheral B cells. LMP2A blocks B-cell receptor (BCR) signal transduction in vitro by modulation of the Syk and Lyn protein tyrosine kinases. Five genetically unique LMP2A transgenic mouse lines (EmuLMP2A) with B-cell lineage expression of LMP2A were generated in this study to analyze the importance of LMP2A expression in vivo. These animals can be grouped into EmuLMP2A(BCR+) (TgB, Tg6, and TgC) and EmuLMP2A(BCR-) (Tg7 and TgE) lines based on B-cell phenotype. LMP2A expression in bone marrow cells of EmuLMP2A(BCR-) lines was associated with a bypass of normal B-lymphocyte developmental checkpoints inasmuch as immunoglobulin light-chain gene rearrangement occurred in the absence of complete immunoglobulin heavy-chain gene rearrangement. The resulting BCR-negative B cells were able to exit the bone marrow and colonize peripheral lymphoid organs. LMP2A expression in EmuLMP2A(BCR+) lines was not associated with altered B-cell development in a genetically wild-type background. When crossed into a recombinase activating null (RAG(-/-)) genetic background, LMP2A expression in either RAG(-/-) EmuLMP2A(BCR+) or RAG(-/-) EmuLMP2A(BCR-) animals was able to provide a survival signal to BCR-negative splenic B cells. Additionally, bone marrow cells from all EmuLMP2A animals were able to proliferate in response to interleukin-7-dependent developmental signals in vitro. These studies illustrate that LMP2A can provide a survival signal to BCR-negative B cells in two different groups of EmuLMP2A transgenic mice.",

    "abstract": "This paper studies the performance of self-financing constant proportions trading strategies, i.e. dynamic asset allocation strategies that keep a fixed constant proportion of wealth invested in each asset in all periods in time. We prove that any self-financing constant proportions strategy yields a strictly positive exponential rate of growth of investor's wealth in a financial market in which prices are described by stationary stochastic processes and the price ratios are non-degenerate. This result might be regarded as being counterintuitive because any such strategy yields no increase of wealth under constant prices. We further show that the result also holds under small transaction costs, which is important for the viability of this approach, since constant proportions strategies require frequent rebalancing of the portfolio.",

    "abstract": "Ragging is any disorderly conduct that has the effect of teasing or handling with rudeness any student, which causes or is likely to cause annoyance, harm or to raise fear in a junior so as to adversely affect the psyche of the junior. Ragging is practiced all over the world, with different nomenclature like hazing, fagging; bapteme in French; doop in Dutch; and Mopokaste in Finnish. The first recorded cases of ragging were in the 8th century BC during the Olympics in Greece. Ragging has been frequently associated with a broad spectrum of physical, behavioral, emotional and social problems among the victims. It independently increases suicide risks. Some of the reasons given by students for ragging are they were also ragged by their seniors; sense of superiority; and introduction. Other factors perpetuating ragging are use of alcohol in hostels and lack of implementation of serious anti-ragging measures by college authorities. Various practical steps to control ragging must include strict role of authorities, ban on alcohol within college and hostels, surprise raids in hostels at night, postings (with accommodation) of wardens in hostels, separate hostels for juniors, presence of college \"disciplinary committee\" and \"cultural committee,\" strict punishments for those involved in ragging, actions by Medical Council of India (MCI) and University Grants Commission (UGC) against the erring colleges and universities and formulation of anti-ragging laws. Ragging should be declared a public health problem because it involves the physical, mental and social exploitation of not only an individual but also of his/her family and the society as a whole.",

    "title": "Factors affecting the rearrangement efficiency of an Ig test gene.",
    "abstract": "A rearrangement test gene, pHRD, containing the mouse IgH enhancer and the metallothionein promoter, has previously been shown to rearrange efficiently after transfection into a pre-B cell line. Experiments are now reported that assess the requirements of the DNA substrate as well as of the transfected cells for efficient rearrangement. It was found that deletion of the metallothionein promoter or substitution of the IgH enhancer by the kappa enhancer did not affect rearrangement. However, deletion of the Ig enhancer reduced the efficiency. Transfection of pHRD into stable hybrids of pre-B cells and myeloma cells resulted in a high frequency of rearrangement only if certain myeloma chromosomes were lost. Furthermore, pHRD introduced into rearrangement incompetent myeloma cells upon subsequent cell fusion with pre-B cells was rearranged only very rarely and then apparently only immediately after cell fusion. Stable pre-B cell x myeloma hybrids that retained the critical myeloma chromosomes were found to have lost VDJ recombinase activity and transcripts of the RAG-1, RAG-2 and TdT genes. It is concluded that transcription, i.e., the copying of the DNA by polymerase, is probably not required for rearrangement, but that the rearrangement substrate must be in an \"open\" chromatin state, such as may be provided by transcriptional factors. Furthermore, the absence of rearrangement in myeloma cells is apparently due to the continued action of an inhibitor of rearrangement.",

    "title": "The rāgs of North Indian music: Their structure and evolution",
    "abstract": "There is a remarkable uniformity in the performance of classical music in North India, an area comprising various geographical regions, which, in this context, includes Pakistan and extends southward into the Deccan. There are, of course, differences in detail-in the interpretation of various rags, in style of performance and in the types and texts of compositions-but on the whole these are only minor differences. The overall uniformity is especially remarkable in view of the fact that these regions contain a heterogeneous population-both racially and culturally-who speak a variety of languages and differ widely in their religious beliefs. North Indian classical music cuts across the usual barriers imposed by differences of language and religion, much as does classical music in the West. Nevertheless, many classical songs have religious texts, both Hindu and Muslim. But rehgious content is not an essential requisite of the music, for some songs are concerned with mundane subjects and some are even composed of meaningless syllables. Just as in Western classical music where great rehgious works written specifically for the Roman Catholic Church can be appreciated as works of art by those of all religious beliefs, so too in Indian music religious themes often serve as vehicles for artistic expression.;Classical music is not the music of the masses but is largely confined to the urban areas of North India. It is performed either in concert halls or in private homes. Its raison d'etre lies in its purely musical content and it is basically on melody and rhythm that its quality is assessed. While a study of the cultural background of the people is essential for a social and historical perspective of this music, its appreciation depends largely on comprehension of the musical idiom, and it is to this end that the present work is dedicated. It had its origin in a series of lectures given at the School of Oriental and African Studies, London, to university students who had no previous knowledge of the subject. At an equivalent age level in India, students would have had several years of musical study at High Schools in both theory and practice, and this would have been supplemented by many hours of listening to both radio broadcasts and recitals. Some of the Western students had not even heard North Indian classical music until they attended the lectures at the School. Thus it was necessary to adopt a completely different approach to the subject from that which is usual in Indian universities. To the Western students Indian music was only incidental to their main course of study and therefore the amount of time which they could devote to it was severely limited. In view of this, it was necessary to concentrate on broad principles and outlines rather than on the details which are the main concern in Indian music colleges.;The critical attitude of the Western student provided a stimulus for the formulation of many of the ideas expressed in this work. With his training in and experience of Western music he has contributed new ideas and interpretations; and by his reluctance to accept traditional Indian explanations, frequently lacking coherence, he has also provoked further enquiry into many topics. The question 'why' has been uppermost in his mind. 'Why does Indian music have its present form Why are only certain scales used in Indian music' To these and other similar questions the traditional reply-'because it was performed in this way by my teacher'-has been unsatisfactory. To a large extent this work has been motivated by such questions and attempts to provide some of the answers. In this respect, it is an exploration into certain aspects of Indian music which have not hitherto received sufficient attention. It is hoped that the reader will be stimulated to further enquiry.",
