    title: Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Knowledge-Intensive NLP Tasks,
    abstract: Large pre-trained language models have been shown to store factual knowledge in their parameters, and achieve state-of-the-art results when fine-tuned on downstream NLP tasks. However, their ability to access and precisely manipulate knowledge is still limited, and hence on knowledge-intensive tasks, their performance lags behind task-specific architectures. Additionally, providing provenance for their decisions and updating their world knowledge remain open research problems. Pre-trained models with a differentiable access mechanism to explicit non-parametric memory can overcome this issue, but have so far been only investigated for extractive downstream tasks. We explore a general-purpose fine-tuning recipe for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) -- models which combine pre-trained parametric and non-parametric memory for language generation. We introduce RAG models where the parametric memory is a pre-trained seq2seq model and the non-parametric memory is a dense vector index of Wikipedia, accessed with a pre-trained neural retriever. We compare two RAG formulations, one which conditions on the same retrieved passages across the whole generated sequence, the other can use different passages per token. We fine-tune and evaluate our models on a wide range of knowledge-intensive NLP tasks and set the state-of-the-art on three open domain QA tasks, outperforming parametric seq2seq models and task-specific retrieve-and-extract architectures. For language generation tasks, we find that RAG models generate more specific, diverse and factual language than a state-of-the-art parametric-only seq2seq baseline.,

    title: The Rag GTPases Bind Raptor and Mediate Amino Acid Signaling to mTORC1,
    abstract: The multiprotein mTORC1 protein kinase complex is the central component of a pathway that promotes growth in response to insulin, energy levels, and amino acids and is deregulated in common cancers. We find that the Rag proteins—a family of four related small guanosine triphosphatases (GTPases)—interact with mTORC1 in an amino acid–sensitive manner and are necessary for the activation of the mTORC1 pathway by amino acids. A Rag mutant that is constitutively bound to guanosine triphosphate interacted strongly with mTORC1, and its expression within cells made the mTORC1 pathway resistant to amino acid deprivation. Conversely, expression of a guanosine diphosphate–bound Rag mutant prevented stimulation of mTORC1 by amino acids. The Rag proteins do not directly stimulate the kinase activity of mTORC1, but, like amino acids, promote the intracellular localization of mTOR to a compartment that also contains its activator Rheb.,

    title: THE METABOLISM OF TUMORS IN THE BODY,
    abstract: In this contribution we discuss the question of whether tumor cells in living animals can be killed off through lack of energy, and the related question of how the tumors are supplied with oxygen and glucose in the body. We assume it is understood that tumor cells obtain the energy required for their existence in two ways: by respiration and by fermentation. In respiration they burn organic materials to carbon dioxide and water; in fermentation they split glucose to lactic acid. All tumors so far tested behave fundamentally alike. There is no essential difference between the cancer cells of transplanted rat tumors and spontaneous tumors, sarcoma and carcinoma cells, and the tar carcinoma, and Rous sarcoma produced by filtrate. The fermentation of tumors was first found with cut pieces of tumor in vitro. I C. and G. Cori 2 demonstrated it in living animals as well. They determined the glucose and lactic acid in the axillary veins of hens having in one wing a Rous sarcoma, and found in 100 cc. of blood 23 mg. less glucose and 16 rag. more lactic acid on the tumor side than on the normal side. A corresponding experiment with a human fore-arm tumor showed in 100 cc. of blood 12 rag. less glucose and 9 rag. more lactic acid on the tumor side. In experiments on the nourishment of tumors through the blood stream, we, like Cori, determined the glucose and lactic acid in tumor veins. Our procedure differed from Cori's in that we compared tumor veins and arteries, not tumor veins and corresponding normal veins. Our differences were greater than Cori's because we went closer to,

    title: Autoimmune dilated cardiomyopathy in PD-1 receptor-deficient mice.,
    abstract: Dilated cardiomyopathy is a severe pathology of the heart with poorly understood etiology. Disruption of the gene encoding the negative immunoregulatory receptor PD-1 in BALB/c mice, but not in BALB/c RAG-2-/- mice, caused dilated cardiomyopathy with severely impaired contraction and sudden death by congestive heart failure. Affected hearts showed diffuse deposition of immunoglobulin G (IgG) on the surface of cardiomyocytes. All of the affected PD-1-/- mice exhibited high-titer circulating IgG autoantibodies reactive to a 33-kilodalton protein expressed specifically on the surface of cardiomyocytes. These results indicate that PD-1 may be an important factor contributing to the prevention of autoimmune diseases.,

    title: mTORC1 Senses Lysosomal Amino Acids Through an Inside-Out Mechanism That Requires the Vacuolar H+-ATPase,
    abstract: Cellular sensing of amino acids occurs at the lysosome and is mediated by the vacuolar proton pump. The mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) protein kinase is a master growth regulator that is stimulated by amino acids. Amino acids activate the Rag guanosine triphosphatases (GTPases), which promote the translocation of mTORC1 to the lysosomal surface, the site of mTORC1 activation. We found that the vacuolar H+–adenosine triphosphatase ATPase (v-ATPase) is necessary for amino acids to activate mTORC1. The v-ATPase engages in extensive amino acid–sensitive interactions with the Ragulator, a scaffolding complex that anchors the Rag GTPases to the lysosome. In a cell-free system, ATP hydrolysis by the v-ATPase was necessary for amino acids to regulate the v-ATPase-Ragulator interaction and promote mTORC1 translocation. Results obtained in vitro and in human cells suggest that amino acid signaling begins within the lysosomal lumen. These results identify the v-ATPase as a component of the mTOR pathway and delineate a lysosome-associated machinery for amino acid sensing.,

    title: RAG-1 and RAG-2, adjacent genes that synergistically activate V(D)J recombination.,
    abstract: The vast repertoire of immunoglobulins and T cell receptors is generated, in part, by V(D)J recombination, a series of genomic rearrangements that occur specifically in developing lymphocytes. The recombination activating gene, RAG-1, which is a gene expressed exclusively in maturing lymphoid cells, was previously isolated. RAG-1 inefficiently induced V(D)J recombinase activity when transfected into fibroblasts, but cotransfection with an adjacent gene, RAG-2, has resulted in at least a 1000-fold increase in the frequency of recombination. The 2.1-kilobase RAG-2 complementary DNA encodes a putative protein of 527 amino acids whose sequence is unrelated to that of RAG-1. Like RAG-1, RAG-2 is conserved between species that carry out V(D)J recombination, and its expression pattern correlates precisely with that of V(D)J recombinase activity. In addition to being located just 8 kilobases apart, these convergently transcribed genes are unusual in that most, if not all, of their coding and 3' untranslated sequences are contained in single exons. RAG-1 and RAG-2 might activate the expression of the V(D)J recombinase but, more likely, they directly participate in the recombination reaction.,

    title: Sestrin2 is a leucine sensor for the mTORC1 pathway,
    abstract: From sensing leucine to metabolic control The mTORC1 protein kinase complex plays central roles in regulating cell growth and metabolism and is implicated in common human diseases such as diabetes and cancer. The level of the amino acid leucine tells an organism a lot about its physiological state, including how much food is available, how much insulin is going to be needed, and whether new muscle mass can be made (see the Perspective by Buel and Blenis). Wolfson et al. identified a biochemical sensor of leucine, Sestrin2, which connects the concentration of leucine to the control of organismal metabolism and growth. When leucine bound to Sestrin2, it was released from a complex with the mTORC1 regulatory factor GATOR2, activating the mTORC1 complex. Saxton et al. describe the crystal structure of Sestrin2 and show how it specifically detects leucine. Aylett et al. determined the structure of human mTORC1 by cryoelectron microscopy and the crystal structure of a regulatory subunit, Raptor. The results reveal the structural basis for the function and intricate regulation of this important enzyme, which is also a strategic drug target. Science, this issue p. 43, p. 48, p. 53; see also p. 25 A protein that senses leucine concentration for metabolic control is identified. [Also see Perspective by Buel and Blenis] Leucine is a proteogenic amino acid that also regulates many aspects of mammalian physiology, in large part by activating the mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) protein kinase, a master growth controller. Amino acids signal to mTORC1 through the Rag guanosine triphosphatases (GTPases). Several factors regulate the Rags, including GATOR1, aGTPase-activating protein; GATOR2, a positive regulator of unknown function; and Sestrin2, a GATOR2-interacting protein that inhibits mTORC1 signaling. We find that leucine, but not arginine, disrupts the Sestrin2-GATOR2 interaction by binding to Sestrin2 with a dissociation constant of 20 micromolar, which is the leucine concentration that half-maximally activates mTORC1. The leucine-binding capacity of Sestrin2 is required for leucine to activate mTORC1 in cells. These results indicate that Sestrin2 is a leucine sensor for the mTORC1 pathway.,

    title: Lysosomal amino acid transporter SLC38A9 signals arginine sufficiency to mTORC1,
    abstract: Sensing amino acids at the lysosome The mTORC1 protein kinase is a complex of proteins that functions to regulate growth and metabolism. Activity of mTORC1 is sensitive to the abundance of amino acids, but how the sensing of amino acids is coupled to the control of mTORC1 has been unclear. Wang et al. searched for predicted membrane proteins that interacted with regulators of mTORC1. They identified a protein currently known only as SLC38A9. Interaction of SLC38A9 with mTORC1 regulators was sensitive to the presence of amino acids. SLC38A9 has sequence similarity to amino acid transporters. Effects of modulation of SLC38A9 in cultured human cells indicate that it may be the sensor that connects the abundance of arginine and leucine to mTORC1 activity. Science, this issue p. 188 A possible sensor for detecting and signaling amino acid abundance is identified. [Also see Perspective by Abraham] The mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) protein kinase is a master growth regulator that responds to multiple environmental cues. Amino acids stimulate, in a Rag-, Ragulator-, and vacuolar adenosine triphosphatase–dependent fashion, the translocation of mTORC1 to the lysosomal surface, where it interacts with its activator Rheb. Here, we identify SLC38A9, an uncharacterized protein with sequence similarity to amino acid transporters, as a lysosomal transmembrane protein that interacts with the Rag guanosine triphosphatases (GTPases) and Ragulator in an amino acid–sensitive fashion. SLC38A9 transports arginine with a high Michaelis constant, and loss of SLC38A9 represses mTORC1 activation by amino acids, particularly arginine. Overexpression of SLC38A9 or just its Ragulator-binding domain makes mTORC1 signaling insensitive to amino acid starvation but not to Rag activity. Thus, SLC38A9 functions upstream of the Rag GTPases and is an excellent candidate for being an arginine sensor for the mTORC1 pathway.,

    title: PD-L1 regulates the development, maintenance, and function of induced regulatory T cells,
    abstract: Both the programmed death (PD) 1–PD-ligand (PD-L) pathway and regulatory T (T reg) cells are instrumental to the maintenance of peripheral tolerance. We demonstrate that PD-L1 has a pivotal role in regulating induced T reg (iT reg) cell development and sustaining iT reg cell function. PD-L1−/− antigen-presenting cells minimally convert naive CD4 T cells to iT reg cells, showing the essential role of PD-L1 for iT reg cell induction. PD-L1–coated beads induce iT reg cells in vitro, indicating that PD-L1 itself regulates iT reg cell development. Furthermore, PD-L1 enhances and sustains Foxp3 expression and the suppressive function of iT reg cells. The obligatory role for PD-L1 in controlling iT reg cell development and function in vivo is illustrated by a marked reduction in iT reg cell conversion and rapid onset of a fatal inflammatory phenotype in PD-L1−/−PD-L2−/− Rag−/− recipients of naive CD4 T cells. PD-L1 iT reg cell development is mediated through the down-regulation of phospho-Akt, mTOR, S6, and ERK2 and concomitant with the up-regulation of PTEN, all key signaling molecules which are critical for iT reg cell development. Thus, PD-L1 can inhibit T cell responses by promoting both the induction and maintenance of iT reg cells. These studies define a novel mechanism for iT reg cell development and function, as well as a new strategy for controlling T reg cell plasticity.,

    title: A Tumor Suppressor Complex with GAP Activity for the Rag GTPases That Signal Amino Acid Sufficiency to mTORC1,
    abstract: Limiting mTORC1 The mTORC1 protein kinase complex has important functions linking metabolism to cell growth and its functions are disrupted in common diseases, including cancer and diabetes. Bar-Peled et al. (p. 1100; see the Perspective by Shaw) discovered regulatory components that help turn down signaling by mTORC1 when cells are deprived of amino acids. Two complexes of proteins, GATOR1 and GATOR2, have opposite effects on activity and cellular localization of mTORC1. Components of the GATOR1 complex negatively regulate mTORC1 and appear to function as tumor supressors. Cancers with loss of GATOR1 function may be particularly amenable to therapeutic strategies that limit activity of mTORC1. A protein complex identified as a negative regulator of the mTORC1 protein kinase complex has tumor suppressor functions. [Also see Perspective by Shaw] The mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) pathway promotes cell growth in response to many cues, including amino acids, which act through the Rag guanosine triphosphatases (GTPases) to promote mTORC1 translocation to the lysosomal surface, its site of activation. Although progress has been made in identifying positive regulators of the Rags, it is unknown if negative factors also exist. Here, we identify GATOR as a complex that interacts with the Rags and is composed of two subcomplexes we call GATOR1 and -2. Inhibition of GATOR1 subunits (DEPDC5, Nprl2, and Nprl3) makes mTORC1 signaling resistant to amino acid deprivation. In contrast, inhibition of GATOR2 subunits (Mios, WDR24, WDR59, Seh1L, and Sec13) suppresses mTORC1 signaling, and epistasis analysis shows that GATOR2 negatively regulates DEPDC5. GATOR1 has GTPase-activating protein (GAP) activity for RagA and RagB, and its components are mutated in human cancer. In cancer cells with inactivating mutations in GATOR1, mTORC1 is hyperactive and insensitive to amino acid starvation, and such cells are hypersensitive to rapamycin, an mTORC1 inhibitor. Thus, we identify a key negative regulator of the Rag GTPases and reveal that, like other mTORC1 regulators, Rag function can be deregulated in cancer.,

    title: Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Large Language Models: A Survey,
    abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) showcase impressive capabilities but encounter challenges like hallucination, outdated knowledge, and non-transparent, untraceable reasoning processes. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a promising solution by incorporating knowledge from external databases. This enhances the accuracy and credibility of the generation, particularly for knowledge-intensive tasks, and allows for continuous knowledge updates and integration of domain-specific information. RAG synergistically merges LLMs' intrinsic knowledge with the vast, dynamic repositories of external databases. This comprehensive review paper offers a detailed examination of the progression of RAG paradigms, encompassing the Naive RAG, the Advanced RAG, and the Modular RAG. It meticulously scrutinizes the tripartite foundation of RAG frameworks, which includes the retrieval, the generation and the augmentation techniques. The paper highlights the state-of-the-art technologies embedded in each of these critical components, providing a profound understanding of the advancements in RAG systems. Furthermore, this paper introduces up-to-date evaluation framework and benchmark. At the end, this article delineates the challenges currently faced and points out prospective avenues for research and development.,

    title: Differential regulation of mTORC1 by leucine and glutamine,
    abstract: Getting specific about amino acid sensing The protein kinase complex mTORC1 regulates growth and metabolism, and its activity is controlled in response to the abundance of cellular amino acids. Jewell et al. report that control of mTORC1 in response to glutamine does not require the Rag guanosine triphosphatase (GTPase) implicated in the sensing of other amino acids such as leucine (see the Perspective by Abraham). For sensing of glutamine, another GTPase, Arf1, was required. Distinct mechanisms thus appear to couple various amino acids to signaling by the mTORC1 complex. Science, this issue p. 194; see also p. 128 Distinct mechanisms sense amino acids leucine and glutamine at the lysosome. [Also see Perspective by Abraham] The mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) complex 1 (mTORC1) integrates environmental and intracellular signals to regulate cell growth. Amino acids stimulate mTORC1 activation at the lysosome in a manner thought to be dependent on the Rag small guanosine triphosphatases (GTPases), the Ragulator complex, and the vacuolar H+–adenosine triphosphatase (v-ATPase). We report that leucine and glutamine stimulate mTORC1 by Rag GTPase-dependent and -independent mechanisms, respectively. Glutamine promoted mTORC1 translocation to the lysosome in RagA and RagB knockout cells and required the v-ATPase but not the Ragulator. Furthermore, we identified the adenosine diphosphate ribosylation factor–1 GTPase to be required for mTORC1 activation and lysosomal localization by glutamine. Our results uncover a signaling cascade to mTORC1 activation independent of the Rag GTPases and suggest that mTORC1 is differentially regulated by specific amino acids.,

    title: Role of the T cell in the genesis of angiotensin II–induced hypertension and vascular dysfunction,
    abstract: Hypertension promotes atherosclerosis and is a major source of morbidity and mortality. We show that mice lacking T and B cells (RAG-1−/− mice) have blunted hypertension and do not develop abnormalities of vascular function during angiotensin II infusion or desoxycorticosterone acetate (DOCA)–salt. Adoptive transfer of T, but not B, cells restored these abnormalities. Angiotensin II is known to stimulate reactive oxygen species production via the nicotinamide adenosine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase in several cells, including some immune cells. Accordingly, adoptive transfer of T cells lacking the angiotensin type I receptor or a functional NADPH oxidase resulted in blunted angiotensin II–dependent hypertension and decreased aortic superoxide production. Angiotensin II increased T cell markers of activation and tissue homing in wild-type, but not NADPH oxidase–deficient, mice. Angiotensin II markedly increased T cells in the perivascular adipose tissue (periadventitial fat) and, to a lesser extent the adventitia. These cells expressed high levels of CC chemokine receptor 5 and were commonly double negative (CD3+CD4−CD8−). This infiltration was associated with an increase in intercellular adhesion molecule-1 and RANTES in the aorta. Hypertension also increased T lymphocyte production of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) α, and treatment with the TNFα antagonist etanercept prevented the hypertension and increase in vascular superoxide caused by angiotensin II. These studies identify a previously undefined role for T cells in the genesis of hypertension and support a role of inflammation in the basis of this prevalent disease. T cells might represent a novel therapeutic target for the treatment of high blood pressure.,

    title: Thymus and autoimmunity: production of CD25+CD4+ naturally anergic and suppressive T cells as a key function of the thymus in maintaining immunologic self-tolerance.,
    abstract: This study shows that the normal thymus produces immunoregulatory CD25+4+8- thymocytes capable of controlling self-reactive T cells. Transfer of thymocyte suspensions depleted of CD25+4+8- thymocytes, which constitute approximately 5% of steroid-resistant mature CD4+8- thymocytes in normal naive mice, produces various autoimmune diseases in syngeneic athymic nude mice. These CD25+4+8- thymocytes are nonproliferative (anergic) to TCR stimulation in vitro, but potently suppress the proliferation of other CD4+8- or CD4-8+ thymocytes; breakage of their anergic state in vitro by high doses of IL-2 or anti-CD28 Ab simultaneously abrogates their suppressive activity; and transfer of such suppression-abrogated thymocyte suspensions produces autoimmune disease in nude mice. These immunoregulatory CD25+4+8- thymocytes/T cells are functionally distinct from activated CD25+4+ T cells derived from CD25-4+ thymocytes/T cells in that the latter scarcely exhibits suppressive activity in vitro, although both CD25+4+ populations express a similar profile of cell surface markers. Furthermore, the CD25+4+8- thymocytes appear to acquire their anergic and suppressive property through the thymic selection process, since TCR transgenic mice develop similar anergic/suppressive CD25+4+8- thymocytes and CD25+4+ T cells that predominantly express TCRs utilizing endogenous alpha-chains, but RAG-2-deficient TCR transgenic mice do not. These results taken together indicate that anergic/suppressive CD25+4+8- thymocytes and peripheral T cells in normal naive mice may constitute a common T cell lineage functionally and developmentally distinct from other T cells, and that production of this unique immunoregulatory T cell population can be another key function of the thymus in maintaining immunologic self-tolerance.,

    title: Hybrid image segmentation using watersheds and fast region merging,
    abstract: A hybrid multidimensional image segmentation algorithm is proposed, which combines edge and region-based techniques through the morphological algorithm of watersheds. An edge-preserving statistical noise reduction approach is used as a preprocessing stage in order to compute an accurate estimate of the image gradient. Then, an initial partitioning of the image into primitive regions is produced by applying the watershed transform on the image gradient magnitude. This initial segmentation is the input to a computationally efficient hierarchical (bottom-up) region merging process that produces the final segmentation. The latter process uses the region adjacency graph (RAG) representation of the image regions. At each step, the most similar pair of regions is determined (minimum cost RAG edge), the regions are merged and the RAG is updated. Traditionally, the above is implemented by storing all RAG edges in a priority queue. We propose a significantly faster algorithm, which additionally maintains the so-called nearest neighbor graph, due to which the priority queue size and processing time are drastically reduced. The final segmentation provides, due to the RAG, one-pixel wide, closed, and accurately localized contours/surfaces. Experimental results obtained with two-dimensional/three-dimensional (2-D/3-D) magnetic resonance images are presented.,

Protein synthesis and autophagic degradation are regulated in an opposite manner by mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), whereas under certain conditions it would be beneficial if they occurred in unison to handle rapid protein turnover. We observed a distinct cellular compartment at the trans side of the Golgi apparatus, the TOR-autophagy spatial coupling compartment (TASCC), where (auto)lysosomes and mTOR accumulated during Ras-induced senescence. mTOR recruitment to the TASCC was amino acid– and Rag guanosine triphosphatase–dependent, and disruption of mTOR localization to the TASCC suppressed interleukin-6/8 synthesis. TASCC formation was observed during macrophage differentiation and in glomerular podocytes; both displayed increased protein secretion. The spatial coupling of cells’ catabolic and anabolic machinery could augment their respective functions and facilitate the mass synthesis of secretory proteins.,

    title: Cutting edge: Cross-talk between cells of the innate immune system: NKT cells rapidly activate NK cells.,
    abstract: alpha-Galactosylceramide (alpha-GalCer) is a glycolipid with potent antitumor properties that binds to CD1d molecules and activates mouse Valpha14 and human Valpha24 NKT cells. Surprisingly, we found that, as early as 90 min after alpha-GalCer injection in vivo, NK cells also displayed considerable signs of activation, including IFN-gamma production and CD69 induction. NK activation was not observed in RAG- or CD1-deficient mice, and it was decreased by pretreatment with anti-IFN-gamma Abs, suggesting that, despite its rapid induction, it was a secondary event that depended on IFN-gamma release by NKT cells. At later time points, B cells and CD8 T cells also began to express CD69. These findings identify a high-speed communication network between the innate and adaptive immune systems in vivo that is initiated upon NKT cell activation. They also suggest that the antitumor effects of alpha-GalCer result from the sequential recruitment of distinct innate and adaptive effector lymphocytes.,

    title: Identifying differences in mRNA expression by representational difference analysis of cDNA.,
    abstract: Detection of differentially regulated genes has been severely hampered by technical limitations. In an effort to overcome these problems, the PCR-coupled subtractive process of representational difference analysis (RDA) [Lisitsyn, N. et al. (1993) Science 259, 946-951] has been adapted for use with cDNA. In a model system, RAG-1 and RAG-2, the genes responsible for activating V(D)J recombination, were identified in a genomic transfectant by cDNA RDA in a small fraction of the time taken by conventional means. The system was also modified to eliminate expected difference products to facilitate the identification of novel genes. Additional alterations to the conditions allowed isolation of differentially expressed fragments. Several caffeine up-regulated clones were obtained from the pre-B cell line 1-8, including IGF-1B, and a predicted homologue of the natural killer cell antigen, NKR-P1. The approach was found to be fast, extremely sensitive, reproducible, and predominantly lacked false positives. cDNA RDA has the capacity and adaptability to be applied to a wide range of biological problems, including the study of single gene disorders, characterization of mutant and complemented cell types, developmental or post-event expression time courses, and examination of pathogen-host interactions.,

    title: Stable gene transfer and expression of human blood coagulation factor IX after intramuscular injection of recombinant adeno-associated virus.,
    abstract: We sought to determine whether intramuscular injection of a recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV) vector expressing human factor IX (hF.IX) could direct expression of therapeutic levels of the transgene in experimental animals. High titer (10(12)-10(13) vector genomes/ml) rAAV expressing hF.IX was prepared, purified, and injected into hindlimb muscles of C57BL/6 mice and Rag 1 mice. In the immunocompetent C57BL/6 mice, immunofluorescence staining of muscle harvested 3 months after injection demonstrated the presence of hF.IX protein, and PCR analysis of muscle DNA was positive for AAV DNA, but no hF.IX was detected in mouse plasma. Further studies showed that these mice had developed circulating antibodies to hF.IX. In follow-up experiments in Rag 1 mice, which carry a mutation in the recombinase activating gene-1 and thus lack functional B and T cells, similar results were seen on DNA analysis of muscle, but these mice also demonstrated therapeutic levels (200-350 ng/ml) of F. IX in the plasma. The time course of F.IX expression demonstrates that levels gradually increase over a period of several weeks before reaching a plateau that is stable 6 months after injection. In other experiments we demonstrate colocalization of hF.IX and collagen IV in intersitial spaces between muscle fibers. Collagen IV has recently been identified as a F.IX-binding protein; this finding explains the unusual pattern of immunofluorescent staining for F.IX shown in these experiments. Thus rAAV can be used to direct stable expression of therapeutic levels of F.IX after intramuscular injection and is a feasible strategy for treatment of patients with hemophilia B.,

    title: The adaptive immune system restrains Alzheimer’s disease pathogenesis by modulating microglial function,
    abstract: Significance Neuroinflammation and activation of innate immunity are pathological hallmarks of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). In contrast, very few studies have examined the impact of the adaptive immune system in AD pathogenesis. Here, we find that genetic ablation of peripheral immune cell populations significantly accelerates amyloid pathogenesis, worsens neuroinflammation, and alters microglial activation state. Critically, it appears that loss of IgG-producing B cells impairs microglial phagocytosis, thereby exacerbating amyloid deposition. Conversely, replacement of IgGs via direct injection or bone marrow transplantation reverses these effects and reduces Aβ pathology. Together, these results highlight the importance of the adaptive immune system and its interactions with microglia in the pathogenesis of AD. The innate immune system is strongly implicated in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). In contrast, the role of adaptive immunity in AD remains largely unknown. However, numerous clinical trials are testing vaccination strategies for AD, suggesting that T and B cells play a pivotal role in this disease. To test the hypothesis that adaptive immunity influences AD pathogenesis, we generated an immune-deficient AD mouse model that lacks T, B, and natural killer (NK) cells. The resulting “Rag-5xfAD” mice exhibit a greater than twofold increase in β-amyloid (Aβ) pathology. Gene expression analysis of the brain implicates altered innate and adaptive immune pathways, including changes in cytokine/chemokine signaling and decreased Ig-mediated processes. Neuroinflammation is also greatly exacerbated in Rag-5xfAD mice as indicated by a shift in microglial phenotype, increased cytokine production, and reduced phagocytic capacity. In contrast, immune-intact 5xfAD mice exhibit elevated levels of nonamyloid reactive IgGs in association with microglia, and treatment of Rag-5xfAD mice or microglial cells with preimmune IgG enhances Aβ clearance. Last, we performed bone marrow transplantation studies in Rag-5xfAD mice, revealing that replacement of these missing adaptive immune populations can dramatically reduce AD pathology. Taken together, these data strongly suggest that adaptive immune cell populations play an important role in restraining AD pathology. In contrast, depletion of B cells and their appropriate activation by T cells leads to a loss of adaptive–innate immunity cross talk and accelerated disease progression.,

    title: Restoration of T cell development in RAG-2-deficient mice by functional TCR transgenes.,
    abstract: Introduction of TCR alpha transgene, TCR beta transgene, or both into RAG-2-/-mice differentially rescues T cell development. RAG-2-/- mice have small numbers of TCR-CD4-CD8-(double negative, DN) thymocytes that express CD3 gamma delta epsilon and zeta proteins intracellularly. Introduction of a TCR beta transgene, but not a TCR alpha transgene, into the RAG-2-/- background restored normal numbers of thymocytes. These cells were CD4+CD8+ (double positive, DP) and expressed small amounts of surface TCR beta chain dimers in association with CD3 gamma delta epsilon but not zeta. RAG-2-/- mice that expressed alpha and beta TCR transgenes developed both DP and single positive thymocytes. Thus, the TCR beta subunit, possibly in association with a novel CD3 complex, participates in the DN to the DP transition.,

    title: Interferon γ Contributes to Initiation of Uterine Vascular Modification, Decidual Integrity, and Uterine Natural Killer Cell Maturation during Normal Murine Pregnancy,
    abstract: The dominant lymphocytes in human and murine implantation sites are transient, pregnancy-associated uterine natural killer (uNK) cells. These cells are a major source of interferon (IFN)-γ. Implantation sites in mice lacking uNK cells (alymphoid recombinase activating gene [RAG]-2−/− common cytokine receptor chain γ [γc]−/−) or IFN-γ signaling (IFN-γ−/− or IFN-γRα−/−) fail to initiate normal pregnancy-induced modification of decidual arteries and display hypocellularity or necrosis of decidua. To investigate the functions of uNK cell–derived IFN-γ during pregnancy, RAG-2−/−γc −/− females were engrafted with bone marrow from IFN-γ−/− mice, IFN-γ signal-disrupted mice (IFN-γRα−/− or signal transducer and activator of transcription [Stat]-1−/−), or from mice able to establish normal uNK cells (severe combined immunodeficient [SCID] or C57BL/6). Mated recipients were analyzed at midgestation. All grafts established uNK cells. Grafts from IFN-γ−/− mice did not reverse host vascular or decidual pathology. Grafts from all other donors promoted modification of decidual arteries and decidual cellularity. Grafts from IFN-γRα−/− or Stat-1−/− mice overproduced uNK cells, all of which were immature. Grafts from IFN-γ−/−, SCID, or C57BL/6 mice produced normal, mature uNK cells. Administration of murine recombinant IFN-γ to pregnant RAG-2−/−γc −/− mice initiated decidual vessel modification and promoted decidual cellularity in the absence of uNK cells. These in vivo findings strongly suggest that uNK cell–derived IFN-γ modifies the expression of genes in the uterine vasculature and stroma, which initiates vessel instability and facilitates pregnancy-induced remodeling of decidual arteries.,

    title: CD4+CD25+ TR Cells Suppress Innate Immune Pathology Through Cytokine-dependent Mechanisms,
    abstract: CD4+CD25+ regulatory T (TR) cells can inhibit a variety of autoimmune and inflammatory diseases, but the precise mechanisms by which they suppress immune responses in vivo remain unresolved. Here, we have used Helicobacter hepaticus infection of T cell–reconstituted recombination-activating gene (RAG)−/− mice as a model to study the ability of CD4+CD25+ TR cells to inhibit bacterially triggered intestinal inflammation. H. hepaticus infection elicited both T cell-mediated and T cell–independent intestinal inflammation, both of which were inhibited by adoptively transferred CD4+CD25+ TR cells. T cell–independent pathology was accompanied by activation of the innate immune system that was also inhibited by CD4+CD25+ TR cells. Suppression of innate immune pathology was dependent on T cell–derived interleukin 10 and also on the production of transforming growth factor β. Thus, CD4+CD25+ TR cells do not only suppress adaptive T cell responses, but are also able to control pathology mediated by innate immune mechanisms.,

    title: Ku70-deficient embryonic stem cells have increased ionizing radiosensitivity, defective DNA end-binding activity, and inability to support V(D)J recombination.,
    abstract: V(D)J recombination requires both lymphoid-specific and generally expressed enzymatic activities. All three known generally expressed activities involved in V(D)J recombination are also involved in DNA double-strand break repair (DSBR). Two of these are components of the DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) and include Ku80 and DNA-PK catalytic subunit (DNA-PKcs); the third, XRCC4, is a protein of unknown function. The Ku70 protein is an additional component of DNA-PK; Ku70 forms a heterodimer with Ku80 to generate the DNA end-binding component of the enzyme. To test putative functions for Ku70, we have used gene-targeted mutation to generate a murine embryonic stem cell line which lacks Ku70 expression. We find that the Ku70(-/-) cells produce no detectable Ku70 and very little Ku80, suggesting a direct interrelationship between their levels. Correspondingly, these cells lack the nonspecific DNA end-binding activity associated with Ku. Significantly, the Ku70(-/-) embryonic stem cells have markedly increased sensitivity to gamma-irradiation relative to Ku70(+/-) or wild-type embryonic stem cells. Furthermore, the Ku70(-/-) cells lack the ability to effectively rejoin signal and coding ends liberated in transiently introduced V(D)J recombination substrates by enforced RAG-1 and RAG-2 expression. We conclude that the Ku70 gene product is involved in DSBR and V(D)J recombination and confirm that the Ku70 gene can be classified as a member of the x-ray cross-complementation group 6 (XRCC6). Potential differences between the Ku70(-/-) and Ku80(-/-) V(D)J recombination defects are discussed.,

    title: Self-RAG: Learning to Retrieve, Generate, and Critique through Self-Reflection,
    abstract: Despite their remarkable capabilities, large language models (LLMs) often produce responses containing factual inaccuracies due to their sole reliance on the parametric knowledge they encapsulate. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), an ad hoc approach that augments LMs with retrieval of relevant knowledge, decreases such issues. However, indiscriminately retrieving and incorporating a fixed number of retrieved passages, regardless of whether retrieval is necessary, or passages are relevant, diminishes LM versatility or can lead to unhelpful response generation. We introduce a new framework called Self-Reflective Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Self-RAG) that enhances an LM's quality and factuality through retrieval and self-reflection. Our framework trains a single arbitrary LM that adaptively retrieves passages on-demand, and generates and reflects on retrieved passages and its own generations using special tokens, called reflection tokens. Generating reflection tokens makes the LM controllable during the inference phase, enabling it to tailor its behavior to diverse task requirements. Experiments show that Self-RAG (7B and 13B parameters) significantly outperforms state-of-the-art LLMs and retrieval-augmented models on a diverse set of tasks. Specifically, Self-RAG outperforms ChatGPT and retrieval-augmented Llama2-chat on Open-domain QA, reasoning and fact verification tasks, and it shows significant gains in improving factuality and citation accuracy for long-form generations relative to these models.,

    title: V(D)J recombination: RAG proteins, repair factors, and regulation.,
    abstract: V(D)J recombination is the specialized DNA rearrangement used by cells of the immune system to assemble immunoglobulin and T-cell receptor genes from the preexisting gene segments. Because there is a large choice of segments to join, this process accounts for much of the diversity of the immune response. Recombination is initiated by the lymphoid-specific RAG1 and RAG2 proteins, which cooperate to make double-strand breaks at specific recognition sequences (recombination signal sequences, RSSs). The neighboring coding DNA is converted to a hairpin during breakage. Broken ends are then processed and joined with the help of several factors also involved in repair of radiation-damaged DNA, including the DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) and the Ku, Artemis, DNA ligase IV, and Xrcc4 proteins, and possibly histone H2AX and the Mre11/Rad50/Nbs1 complex. There may be other factors not yet known. V(D)J recombination is strongly regulated by limiting access to RSS sites within chromatin, so that particular sites are available only in certain cell types and developmental stages. The roles of enhancers, histone acetylation, and chromatin remodeling factors in controlling accessibility are discussed. The RAG proteins are also capable of transposing RSS-ended fragments into new DNA sites. This transposition helps to explain the mechanism of RAG action and supports earlier proposals that V(D)J recombination evolved from an ancient mobile DNA element.,

    title: A modified tetracycline-regulated system provides autoregulatory, inducible gene expression in cultured cells and transgenic mice.,
    abstract: A system for tetracycline-regulated inducible gene expression was described recently which relies on constitutive expression of a tetracycline-controlled transactivator (tTA) fusion protein combining the tetracycline repressor and the transcriptional activation domain of VP16 [Gossen, M. & Bujard, H. (1992) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 89, 5547-5551]. This system yielded only low levels of transactivator protein, probably because tTA is toxic. To avoid this difficulty, we placed the tTA gene under the control of the inducible promoter to which tTA binds, making expression of tTA itself inducible and autoregulatory. When used to drive expression of the recombination activating genes 1 and 2 (RAG-1 and RAG-2), the autoregulatory system yielded both substantially higher levels of variable (diversity) joining [V(D)J] recombination activity (70-fold on average) and inducible expression in a much larger fraction of transfected cells (autoregulatory, 90%, vs. constitutive, 18%). In addition, this system allowed the creation of transgenic mice in which expression of a luciferase transgene was inducible tens to hundreds of times the basal levels in most tissues examined. Induced levels of expression were highest in thymus and lung and appear to be substantially higher than in previously reported inducible luciferase transgenic mice created with the constitutive system. With the modified system, inducible transactivator mRNA and protein were easily detected in cell lines by RNA and Western blotting, and transactivator mRNA was detected by RNA blotting in some tissues of transgenic mice. This autoregulatory system represents an improved strategy for tetracycline-regulated gene expression both in cultured cells and in transgenic animals.,

    title: RAG-2-deficient blastocyst complementation: an assay of gene function in lymphocyte development.,
    abstract: We describe a system to evaluate the function of lymphocyte-specific and generally expressed genes in the differentiation and/or function of lymphocytes. RAG-2 (recombination-activating gene 2)-deficient mice have no mature B and T lymphocytes due to the inability to initiate VDJ recombination. Blastocysts from RAG-2-deficient mice generate animals with no mature B and T cells following implantation into foster mothers. However, injection of normal ES cells into RAG-2-deficient blastocysts leads to the generation of somatic chimeras with mature B and T cells all of which derive from the injected ES cells (referred to as RAG-2-deficient blastocyst complementation). Complementation of RAG-2-deficient blastocysts with mutant ES cells heterozygous for a targeted mutation that deletes all immunoglobulin heavy-chain joining (JH) gene segments (JH+/-) also leads to generation of chimeras with normal B and T cells. However, complementation with ES cells homozygous for the JH mutation (JH-/-) generates animals with normal T cells but no B cells, due to a block in B-cell development at a very early stage. Transfection of a functionally assembled mu heavy-chain gene into the JH-/- ES cells prior to blastocyst injection rescues the JH-/- mutation and allows the generation of both mature T and mature B cells. The rescued B cells express IgM but not IgD and respond normally to bacterial lipopolysaccharide stimulation by proliferating and by secreting IgM.,

    title: A phylogenetic hypothesis for passerine birds: taxonomic and biogeographic implications of an analysis of nuclear DNA sequence data,
    abstract: Passerine birds comprise over half of avian diversity, but have proved difficult to classify. Despite a long history of work on this group, no comprehensive hypothesis of passerine family–level relationships was available until recent analyses of DNA–DNA hybridization data. Unfortunately, given the value of such a hypothesis in comparative studies of passerine ecology and behaviour, the DNA–hybridization results have not been well tested using independent data and analytical approaches. Therefore, we analysed nucleotide sequence variation at the nuclear RAG–1 and c–mos genes from 69 passerine taxa, including representatives of most currently recognized families. In contradiction to previous DNA–hybridization studies, our analyses suggest paraphyly of suboscine passerines because the suboscine New Zealand wren Acanthisitta was found to be sister to all other passerines. Additionally, we reconstructed the parvorder Corvida as a basal paraphyletic grade within the oscine passerines. Finally, we found strong evidence that several family–level taxa are misplaced in the hybridization results, including the Alaudidae, Irenidae, and Melanocharitidae. The hypothesis of relationships we present here suggests that the oscine passerines arose on the Australian continental plate while it was isolated by oceanic barriers and that a major northern radiation of oscines (i.e. the parvorder Passerida) originated subsequent to dispersal from the south.,

    title: T and B lymphocytes play a minor role in atherosclerotic plaque formation in the apolipoprotein E-deficient mouse.,
    abstract: Cellular and humoral immunity have been implicated in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. To determine whether an intact immune system is necessary for the formation of atherosclerotic lesions, we have generated immunodeficient mice with hypercholesterolemia and atherosclerosis by crossbreeding the apolipoprotein E (apoE)-deficient mouse with the recombinase activating gene 1 (Rag-1) knockout mouse. Chow-fed immunodeficient mice with targeted disruption in both apoE and Rag-1 (E0/R0) had a 2-fold decrement in aortic root lesion size at 16 weeks of age, compared with immunocompetent littermates, which were heterozygotes at the Rag-1 locus (E0/R1). Nearly all atherosclerotic lesions from chow-fed animals were limited to raised foam cell fatty streaks. In contrast, when a second group of animals was fed a high-fat Western-type diet to accelerate lesion development, there were no differences in either aortic root lesion size or the percent of the total aorta occupied by lesions. Fibrous plaques with well-defined caps and necrotic cores were detected in both Western diet-fed E0/R0 and E0/R1 animals. We conclude that T and B lymphocytes play only a minor role in the rate of forming foam cell lesions, and they are not necessary for the formation of fibroproliferative plaques.,

    title: A Gondwanan origin of passerine birds supported by DNA sequences of the endemic New Zealand wrens,
    abstract: Zoogeographic, palaeontological and biochemical data support a Southern Hemisphere origin for passerine birds, while accumulating molecular data suggest that most extant avian orders originated in the mid–Late Cretaceous. We obtained DNA sequence data from the nuclear c–myc and RAG–1 genes of the major passerine groups and here we demonstrate that the endemic New Zealand wrens (Acanthisittidae) are the sister taxon to all other extant passerines, supporting a Gondwanan origin and early radiation of passerines. We propose that (i) the acanthisittids were isolated when New Zealand separated from Gondwana (ca. 82–85 Myr ago), (ii) suboscines, in turn, were derived from an ancestral lineage that inhabited western Gondwana, and (iii) the ancestors of the oscines (songbirds) were subsequently isolated by the separation of Australia from Antarctica. The later spread of passerines into the Northern Hemisphere reflects the northward migration of these former Gondwanan elements.,

    title: Interdependence of cortical thymic epithelial cell differentiation and T-lineage commitment.,
    abstract: Thymocyte and thymic epithelial cell (TEC) development are interdependent processes. Although lineage relationships among progressively maturing thymocyte subsets have been characterized, the developmental relationships among TEC subsets are obscure. Because epithelial cells express distinct keratin (K) species as a function of differentiation stage and proliferative status, we used K expression patterns to identify mouse TEC subsets and determine their lineage relationships. As expected, cortical and medullary TEC subsets express distinct K expression patterns in the normal thymus. However, we detected two distinct cortical TEC subsets, a major K8(+)K5(-) subset and a minor K8(+)K5(+) subset, which is highly represented at the cortico-medullary junction. Both cortical TEC subsets are also present in recombination activating gene 1 (RAG-1(-/-)) and TCRbetaxdelta-/- thymi in which T-cell development is blocked at the CD4(-)CD8(-)CD25(+)CD44(-) pre-T cell stage. In contrast, K8(+)K5(+) TECs predominate in the thymi of human CD3epsilon transgenic mice in which thymocyte development is blocked at an earlier CD4(-)CD8(-)CD25(-)CD44(+) stage. Transplantation of newborn human CD3epsilon transgenic thymi under the kidney capsule of RAG-1(-/-) mice results in the emergence of K8(+)K5(-) TECs concomitant with the appearance of CD25(+) thymocytes. Together, the data suggest that cortical TEC development proceeds from a K8(+)K5(+) precursor subset to a K8(+)K5(-) stage in a differentiation process concomitant with T-cell lineage commitment.,

    title: Rapidly available glucose in foods: an in vitro measurement that reflects the glycemic response.,
    abstract: BACKGROUND
A chemically based classification of dietary carbohydrates that takes into account the likely site, rate, and extent of digestion is presented. The classification divides dietary carbohydrates into sugars, starch fractions, and nonstarch polysaccharides, and groups them into rapidly available glucose (RAG) and slowly available glucose (SAG) as to the amounts of glucose (from sugar and starch, including maltodextrins) likely to be available for rapid and slow absorption, respectively, in the human small intestine.


OBJECTIVE
We hypothesize that RAG is an important food-related determinant of the glycemic response.


DESIGN
The measurement of RAG, SAG, and starch fractions by an in vitro technique is described, based on the measurement by HPLC of the glucose released from a test food during timed incubation with digestive enzymes under standardized conditions. Eight healthy adult subjects consumed 8 separate test meals ranging in RAG content from 11 to 49 g.


RESULTS
The correlation between glycemic response and RAG was highly significant (P < 0.0001) and a given percentage increase in RAG was associated with the same percentage increase in glycemic response. After subject variation was accounted for, RAG explained 70% of the remaining variance in glycemic response.


CONCLUSIONS
We show the significance of in vitro measurements of RAG in relation to glycemic response in human studies. The simple in vitro measurement of RAG and SAG is of physiologic relevance and could serve as a tool for investigating the importance of the amount, type, and form of dietary carbohydrates for health.,

    title: IL-23 plays a key role in Helicobacter hepaticus–induced T cell–dependent colitis,
    abstract: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the gastrointestinal tract that is caused in part by a dysregulated immune response to the intestinal flora. The common interleukin (IL)-12/IL-23p40 subunit is thought to be critical for the pathogenesis of IBD. We have analyzed the role of IL-12 versus IL-23 in two models of Helicobacter hepaticus–triggered T cell–dependent colitis, one involving anti–IL-10R monoclonal antibody treatment of infected T cell–sufficient hosts, and the other involving CD4+ T cell transfer into infected Rag−/− recipients. Our data demonstrate that IL-23 and not IL-12 is essential for the development of maximal intestinal disease. Although IL-23 has been implicated in the differentiation of IL-17–producing CD4+ T cells that alone are sufficient to induce autoimmune tissue reactivity, our results instead support a model in which IL-23 drives both interferon γ and IL-17 responses that together synergize to trigger severe intestinal inflammation.,

    title: The RAG proteins and V(D)J recombination: complexes, ends, and transposition.,
    abstract: V(D)J recombination proceeds through a series of protein:DNA complexes mediated in part by the RAG1 and RAG2 proteins. These proteins are responsible for sequence-specific DNA recognition and DNA cleavage, and they appear to perform multiple postcleavage roles in the reaction as well. Here we review the interaction of the RAG proteins with DNA, the chemistry of the cleavage reaction, and the higher order complexes in which these events take place. We also discuss postcleavage functions of the RAG proteins, including recent evidence indicating that they initiate the process of coding end processing by nicking hairpin DNA termini. Finally, we discuss the evolutionary and functional implications of the finding that RAG1 and RAG2 constitute a transposase, and we consider RAG protein biochemistry in the context of several bacterial transposition systems. This suggests a model of the RAG protein active site in which two divalent metal ions serve alternating and opposite roles as activators of attacking hydroxyl groups and stabilizers of oxyanion leaving groups.,

    title: Moral Outrage Mediates the Dampening Effect of System Justification on Support for Redistributive Social Policies,
    abstract: To understand how and why people tolerate ongoing social and economic inequality, we conducted two studies investigating the hypothesis that system justification is associated with reduced emotional distress and a lack of support for helping the disadvantaged. In Study 1, we found that the endorsement of a system-justifying ideology was negatively associated with moral outrage, existential guilt, and support for helping the disadvantaged. In Study 2, the induction of a system-justification mind-set through exposure to “rags-to-riches” narratives decreased moral outrage, negative affect, and therefore intentions to help the disadvantaged. In both studies, moral outrage (outward-focused distress) was found to mediate the dampening effect of system justification on support for redistribution, whereas existential guilt (Study 1) or negative affect in general (Study 2; inward-focused distress) did not. Thus, system-justifying ideology appears to undercut the redistribution of social and economic resources by alleviating moral outrage.,

    title: CD4+CD25−Foxp3− Th1 cells are the source of IL-10–mediated immune suppression in chronic cutaneous leishmaniasis,
    abstract: Nonhealing forms of leishmaniasis in humans are commonly associated with elevated levels of the deactivating cytokine IL-10, and in the mouse, normally chronic infections can be cleared in the absence of IL-10. Using a Leishmania major strain that produces nonhealing dermal lesions in a T helper type 1 (Th1) cell–polarized setting, we have analyzed the cellular sources of IL-10 and their relative contribution to immune suppression. IL-10 was produced by innate cells, as well as CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ and CD4+CD25−Foxp3− T cells in the chronic lesion. Nonetheless, only IL-10 production by antigen-specific CD4+CD25−Foxp3− T cells, the majority of which also produced IFN-γ, was necessary for suppression of acquired immunity in Rag−/− reconstituted mice. Surprisingly, Rag−/− mice reconstituted with naive CD4+ T cells depleted of natural T regulatory cells developed more severe infections, associated with elevated levels of IL-10 and, especially, Th2 cytokines in the site. The data demonstrate that IL-10–producing Th1 cells, activated early in a strong inflammatory setting as a mechanism of feedback control, are the principal mediators of T cell–derived IL-10–dependent immune suppression in a chronic intracellular infection.,

    title: The regulated expression of B lineage associated genes during B cell differentiation in bone marrow and fetal liver,
    abstract: The expression of B lineage associated genes during early B cell differentiation stages is not firmly established. Using cell surface markers and multiparameter flow cytometry, bone marrow (BM) cells can be resolved into six fractions, representing sequential stages of development; i.e., pre-Pro-B, early Pro-B, late Pro-B/large Pre-B, small Pre-B, immature B, and mature B cells. Here we quantitate the levels of several B lineage associated genes in each of these fractions by RT-PCR, demonstrating different patterns of expression. We find that expression of terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT), lambda 5, and VpreB is predominantly restricted to the Pro-B stages. Rag-1 and Rag-2 expression is also tightly regulated, and is found largely in the Pro-B through small Pre-B stages. Mb-1 is present from Pro-B throughout the pathway at high levels. Finally, Bcl-2 is expressed at high levels only at the pre-Pro-B and mature B stages, whereas it is low during all the intermediate stages. We also correlate this expression data with an analysis of the onset of Ig gene rearrangement as assessed by amplifying D-JH, VH-DJH, and VK-JK. Finally, we report differences in gene expression during B lymphopoiesis at two distinct ontogenic timings, in fetal liver and adult BM: both TdT and the precursor lymphocyte regulated myosin-like light chain are expressed at high levels in the Pro-B cell stage in bone marrow, but are absent from the corresponding fraction in fetal liver. In contrast, lambda 5, VpreB, Rag-1, and Rag-2 are expressed at comparable levels.,

    title: Specificity requirements for selection and effector functions of CD25+4+ regulatory T cells in anti-myelin basic protein T cell receptor transgenic mice,
    abstract: CD25+4+ regulatory T cells (Treg) play an indispensable role in preventing autoimmunity. Little is known, however, about the antigen specificities required for their development and effector functions. Mice transgenic for an anti-myelin basic protein (MBP) T cell antigen receptor (TCR) spontaneously develop experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) when deficient for the RAG-1 gene (T/R−), whereas RAG-1-competent transgenic animals (T/R+) remain healthy, protected by CD4+ Treg-expressing endogenous TCRs. We have now investigated the role and specificity of CD25+4+ Treg in this system. The results show that T/R+ animals contain MBP-specific suppressive CD25+4+ cells, whereas T/R− do not. Adoptive transfer of CD25+4+ cells from nontransgenic or T/R+ donors into T/R− mice prevented the development of EAE. Surprisingly, transfer of nontransgenic CD25+4+ cells purified from T/R+ donors conferred only a limited protection, possibly because of their restricted repertoire diversity that we demonstrate here. Absence of transgenic CD25+4+ cells in animals deficient for endogenous TCRα chains and analyses of endogenous TCR gene expression in subsets of CD4+ cells from T/R+ mice demonstrate that development of transgenic MBP-specific CD25+4+ Treg depends on the coexpression of endogenous TCRα chains. Taken together, these results indicate that specificity to MBP is required for effector functions but is not sufficient for thymic selection/commitment of CD25+4+ Treg preventing EAE.,

Urbanization contributes enhanced municipal solid waste (MSW) generation and unscientific handling of MSW degrades the urban environment and causes health hazards. In this paper, an attempt is made to evaluate the major parameters of MSWM, in addition to a comprehensive review of MSW generation, its characterization, collection, and treatment options as practiced in India. The current status of MSWM in Indian states and important cities of India is also reported. The essential conditions for harnessing optimal benefits from the possibilities for public private partnership and challenges thereof and unnoticeable role of rag-pickers are also discussed. The study concludes that installation of decentralized solid waste processing units in metropolitan cities/towns and development of formal recycling industry sector is the need of the hour in developing countries like India.,

    title: Vaccination with early ferroptotic cancer cells induces efficient antitumor immunity,
    abstract: Background Immunotherapy represents the future of clinical cancer treatment. The type of cancer cell death determines the antitumor immune response and thereby contributes to the efficacy of anticancer therapy and long-term survival of patients. Induction of immunogenic apoptosis or necroptosis in cancer cells does activate antitumor immunity, but resistance to these cell death modalities is common. Therefore, it is of great importance to find other ways to kill tumor cells. Recently, ferroptosis has been identified as a novel, iron-dependent form of regulated cell death but whether ferroptotic cancer cells are immunogenic is unknown. Methods Ferroptotic cell death in murine fibrosarcoma MCA205 or glioma GL261 cells was induced by RAS-selective lethal 3 and ferroptosis was analyzed by flow cytometry, atomic force and confocal microscopy. ATP and high-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) release were detected by luminescence and ELISA assays, respectively. Immunogenicity in vitro was analyzed by coculturing of ferroptotic cancer cells with bone-marrow derived dendritic cells (BMDCs) and rate of phagocytosis and activation/maturation of BMDCs (CD11c+CD86+, CD11c+CD40+, CD11c+MHCII+, IL-6, RNAseq analysis). The tumor prophylactic vaccination model in immune-competent and immune compromised (Rag-2−/−) mice was used to analyze ferroptosis immunogenicity. Results Ferroptosis can be induced in cancer cells by inhibition of glutathione peroxidase 4, as evidenced by confocal and atomic force microscopy and inhibitors’ analysis. We demonstrate for the first time that ferroptosis is immunogenic in vitro and in vivo. Early, but not late, ferroptotic cells promote the phenotypic maturation of BMDCs and elicit a vaccination-like effect in immune-competent mice but not in Rag-2−/− mice, suggesting that the mechanism of immunogenicity is very tightly regulated by the adaptive immune system and is time dependent. Also, ATP and HMGB1, the best-characterized damage-associated molecular patterns involved in immunogenic cell death, have proven to be passively released along the timeline of ferroptosis and act as immunogenic signal associated with the immunogenicity of early ferroptotic cancer cells. Conclusions These results pave the way for the development of new therapeutic strategies for cancers based on induction of ferroptosis, and thus broadens the current concept of immunogenic cell death and opens the door for the development of new strategies in cancer immunotherapy.,

    title: Neoteny in Lymphocytes: Rag1 and Rag2 Expression in Germinal Center B Cells,

Expression of the Rag genes has been thought to be limited to developmentally immature lymphocyte populations that in normal adult animals are primarily restricted to the bone marrow and thymus. Abundant RAG1 and RAG2 protein and messenger RNA was detected in the activated B cells that populate murine splenic and Peyer's patch germinal centers. Germinal center B cells thus share fundamental characteristics of immature lymphocytes, raising the possibility that antigen-dependent secondary V(D)J rearrangements modify the peripheral antibody repertoire.,

    title: 53BP1 is required for class switch recombination,
    abstract: 53BP1 participates early in the DNA damage response and is involved in cell cycle checkpoint control. Moreover, the phenotype of mice and cells deficient in 53BP1 suggests a defect in DNA repair (Ward et al., 2003b). Therefore, we asked whether or not 53BP1 would be required for the efficient repair of DNA double strand breaks. Our data indicate that homologous recombination by gene conversion does not depend on 53BP1. Moreover, 53BP1-deficient mice support normal V(D)J recombination, indicating that 53BP1 is not required for “classic” nonhomologous end joining. However, class switch recombination is severely impaired in the absence of 53BP1, suggesting that 53BP1 facilitates DNA end joining in a way that is not required or redundant for the efficient closing of RAG-induced strand breaks. These findings are similar to those observed in mice or cells deficient in the tumor suppressors ATM and H2AX, further suggesting that the functions of ATM, H2AX, and 53BP1 are closely linked.,

    title: Amino Acid-Dependent mTORC1 Regulation by the Lysosomal Membrane Protein SLC38A9,
    abstract: ABSTRACT The serine/threonine kinase mTORC1 regulates cellular homeostasis in response to many cues, such as nutrient status and energy level. Amino acids induce mTORC1 activation on lysosomes via the small Rag GTPases and the Ragulator complex, thereby controlling protein translation and cell growth. Here, we identify the human 11-pass transmembrane protein SLC38A9 as a novel component of the Rag-Ragulator complex. SLC38A9 localizes with Rag-Ragulator complex components on lysosomes and associates with Rag GTPases in an amino acid-sensitive and nucleotide binding state-dependent manner. Depletion of SLC38A9 inhibits mTORC1 activity in the presence of amino acids and in response to amino acid replenishment following starvation. Conversely, SLC38A9 overexpression causes RHEB (Ras homolog enriched in brain) GTPase-dependent hyperactivation of mTORC1 and partly sustains mTORC1 activity upon amino acid deprivation. Intriguingly, during amino acid starvation mTOR is retained at the lysosome upon SLC38A9 depletion but fails to be activated. Together, the findings of our study reveal SLC38A9 as a Rag-Ragulator complex member transducing amino acid availability to mTORC1 activity.,

    title: Amino Acid Deprivation Inhibits TORC1 Through a GTPase-Activating Protein Complex for the Rag Family GTPase Gtr1,
    abstract: A complex that inactivates a GTPase keeps the TORC1 pathway in check in times of amino acid deprivation. Suppressing Activity During Deprivation The target of rapamycin complex 1 (TORC1) in yeast couples nutrient availability to signaling pathways that mediate cell growth and proliferation. Amino acids stimulate the activity of TORC1 through Gtr1 and Gtr2, members of the Rag family of guanosine triphosphatases (GTPases). Panchaud et al. identified a complex containing Iml1, Npr2, and Npr3 that promoted the inactivation of Gtr1, leading to decreased activity of TORC1 when amino acid availability was limited. The human ortholog of Iml1 partially restored TORC1 inhibition in yeast cells lacking Iml1. As with other signaling pathways that restrict TORC1 activity, the human orthologs of Iml1, Npr2, and Npr3 could function as tumor suppressors. The Rag family of guanosine triphosphatases (GTPases) regulates eukaryotic cell growth in response to amino acids by activating the target of rapamycin complex 1 (TORC1). In humans, this pathway is often deregulated in cancer. In yeast, amino acids promote binding of GTP (guanosine 5′-triphosphate) to the Rag family GTPase Gtr1, which, in combination with a GDP (guanosine diphosphate)–bound Gtr2, forms the active, TORC1-stimulating GTPase heterodimer. We identified Iml1, which functioned in a complex with Npr2 and Npr3, as a GAP (GTPase-activating protein) for Gtr1. Upon amino acid deprivation, Iml1 transiently interacted with Gtr1 at the vacuolar membrane to stimulate its intrinsic GTPase activity and consequently decrease the activity of TORC1. Our results delineate a potentially conserved mechanism by which the Iml1, Npr2, and Npr3 orthologous proteins in humans may suppress tumor formation.,

    title: Thymocyte expression of RAG-1 and RAG-2: termination by T cell receptor cross-linking.,
    abstract: The expression of the V(D)J [variable (diversity) joining elements] recombination activating genes, RAG-1 and RAG-2, has been examined during T cell development in the thymus. In situ hybridization to intact thymus and RNA blot analysis of isolated thymic subpopulations separated on the basis of T cell receptor (TCR) expression demonstrated that both TCR- and TCR+ cortical thymocytes express RAG-1 and RAG-2 messenger RNA's. Within the TCR+ population, RAG expression was observed in immature CD4+CD8+ (double positive) cells, but not in the more mature CD4+CD8- or CD4-CD8+ (single positive) subpopulations. Thus, although cortical thymocytes that bear TCR on their surface continue to express RAG-1 and RAG-2, it appears that the expression of both genes is normally terminated during subsequent thymic maturation. Since thymocyte maturation in vivo is thought to be regulated through the interaction of the TCR complex with self major histocompatibility complex (MHC) antigens, these data suggest that signals transduced by the TCR complex might result in the termination of RAG expression. Consistent with this hypothesis, thymocyte TCR cross-linking in vitro led to rapid termination of RAG-1 and RAG-2 expression, whereas cross-linking of other T cell surface antigens such as CD4, CD8, or HLA class I had no effect.,

We report that the presence of Sle1z/Sle1bz impairs B cell anergy, receptor revision, and deletion. Members of the SLAM costimulatory molecule family constitute prime candidates for Sle1bz, among which the Ly108.1 isoform of the Ly108 gene was most highly expressed in immature B cells from lupus-prone B6.Sle1z mice. The normal Ly108.2 allele, but not the lupus-associated Ly108.1 allele, was found to sensitize immature B cells to deletion and RAG reexpression. As a potential regulator of tolerance checkpoints, Ly108 may censor self-reactive B cells, hence safeguarding against autoimmunity.,

DNA cleavage requires a series of protein-DNA complexes containing the RAG1 and RAG2 proteins and recombination signals that flank the recombining gene segments. In this review, we discuss recent advances in our understanding of the function and domain organization of the RAG proteins, the composition and structure of RAG-DNA complexes, and the pathways that lead to the formation of these complexes. We also consider the functional significance of RAG-mediated histone recognition and ubiquitin ligase activities, and the role played by RAG in ensuring proper repair of DNA breaks made during V(D)J recombination. Finally, we propose a model for the formation of RAG-DNA complexes that involves anchoring of RAG1 at the recombination signal nonamer and RAG2-dependent surveillance of adjoining DNA for suitable spacer and heptamer sequences.,

    title: Myelin Antigen-Specific CD8+ T Cells Are Encephalitogenic and Produce Severe Disease in C57BL/6 Mice1,
    abstract: Encephalitogenic T cells that mediate experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) are commonly assumed to be exclusively CD4+, but formal proof is still lacking. In this study, we report that synthetic peptides 35–55 from myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (pMOG35–55) consistently activate a high proportion of CD8+ αβTCR+ T cells that are encephalitogenic in C57BL/6 (B6) mice. The encephalitogenic potential of CD8+ MOG-specific T cells was established by adoptive transfer of CD8-enriched MOG-specific T cells. These cells induced a much more severe and permanent disease than disease actively induced by immunization with pMOG35–55. CNS lesions in pMOG35–55 CD8+ T cell-induced EAE were progressive and more destructive. The CD8+ T cells were strongly pathogenic in syngeneic B6 and RAG-1−/− mice, but not in isogeneic β2-microglobulin-deficient mice. MOG-specific CD8+ T cells could be repeatedly reisolated for up to 287 days from recipient B6 or RAG-1−/− mice in which disease was induced adoptively with <1 × 106 T cells sensitized to pMOG35–55. It is postulated that MOG induces a relapsing and/or progressive pattern of EAE by eliciting a T cell response dominated by CD8+ autoreactive T cells. Such cells appear to have an enhanced tissue-damaging effect and persist in the animal for long periods.,

    title: Identification of Multiple Isolated Lymphoid Follicles on the Antimesenteric Wall of the Mouse Small Intestine1,
    abstract: We have revealed that 100–200 clusters, filled with closely packed lymphocytes, can be found throughout the length of the antimesenteric wall of the mouse small intestine. They are composed of a large B cell area, including a germinal center, and epithelia overlying the clusters contain M cells. A large fraction of B cells displays B220+CD19+CD23+IgMlowIgDhighCD5−Mac-1− phenotype, and the composition of IgA+ B cells is smaller but substantial. To our knowledge, these clusters are the first identification of isolated lymphoid follicles (ILF) in mouse small intestine. ILF can be first detected at 7 (BALB/c mice) and 25 (C57BL/6 mice) days after birth, and lymphoid clusters equivalent in terms of cellular mass to ILF are present in germfree, athymic nude, RAG-2−/−, TCR-β−/−, and Ig μ-chain mutant (μm−/−) mice, although c-kit+ cells outnumber B220+ cells in germfree and athymic nude mice, and most lymphoid residents are c-kit+B220− in RAG-2−/−, TCR-β−/−, and μm−/− mice. ILF develop normally in the progeny of transplacentally manipulated Peyer’s patch (PP)-deficient mice, and decreased numbers of conspicuously atrophied ILF are present in IL-7Rα−/− PPnull mice. Neither ILF nor PP are detectable in lymphotoxin α−/− and aly/aly mice that retain well-developed cryptopatches (CP) and thymus-independent subsets of intraepithelial T cells, whereas ILF, PP, CP, and thymus-independent subsets of intraepithelial T cells disappear from common cytokine receptor γ-chain mutant mice. These findings indicate that ILF, PP, and CP constitute three distinct organized gut-associated lymphoid tissues that reside in the lamina propria of the mouse small intestine.,

    title: Horting hatches an egg: a new graph-theoretic approach to collaborative filtering,
    abstract: This paper introduces a new and novel approach to ratingbased collaborative filtering. The new technique is most appropriate for e-commerce merchants offering one or more groups of relatively homogeneous items such as compact disks, videos, books, software and the like. In contrast with other known collaborative filtering techniques, the new algorithm is graph-theoretic, based on the twin new concepts of ho&rag and predictability. As is demonstrated in this paper, the technique is fast, scalable, accurate, and requires only a modest learning curve. It makes use of a hierarchical classification scheme in order to introduce context into the rating process, and uses so-called creative links in order to find surprising and atypical items to recommend, perhaps even items which cross the group boundaries. The new technique is one of the key engines of the Intelligent Recommendation Algorithm (IRA) project, now being developed at IBM Research. In addition to several other recommendation engines, IRA contains a situation analyzer to determine the most appropriate mix of engines for a particular e-commerce merchant, as well as an engine for optimizing the placement of advertisements.,

    title: Myelin Basic Protein–specific T Helper 2 (Th2) Cells Cause Experimental Autoimmune Encephalomyelitis in Immunodeficient Hosts Rather than Protect Them from the Disease,
    abstract: Chronic inflammatory autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis, diabetes, and rheumatoid arthritis are caused by CD4+ Th1 cells. Because Th2 cells antagonize Th1 cell functions in several ways, it is believed that immune deviation towards Th2 can prevent or cure autoimmune diseases. Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) is a demyelinating disease used as a model for multiple sclerosis. Using an adoptive transfer system we assessed the role of Th1 and Th2 cells in EAE. In vitro generated Th1 and Th2 cells from myelin basic protein (MBP)-specific TCR transgenic mice were transferred into normal and immunodeficient mice. Th1 cells caused EAE in all recipients after a brief preclinical phase. Surprisingly, Th2 cells also caused EAE in RAG-1 KO mice and in αβ T cell–deficient mice, albeit after a longer preclinical phase. Normal or γδ T cell–deficient mice were resistant to EAE induced by Th2 cells. The histopathological features of this disease resembled those of an allergic process. In addition, disease induction by Th1 cells was not altered by coadmininstration of Th2 cells in any of the recipients. These findings indicate that MBP-specific Th2 cells have the potential to induce EAE and that the disease induced by previously activated Th1 cells cannot be prevented by normal lymphocytes nor by previously activated Th2 cells.,

    title: Functional immunoglobulin transgenes guide ordered B-cell differentiation in Rag-1-deficient mice.,
    abstract: We have examined the regulatory role of the individual components of the immunoglobulin antigen receptor in B-cell development by transgenic complementation of Rag-1 deficient (Rag-1-) mice. Complementation with a membrane mu heavy chain (mu HC) gene allows progression of developmentally arrested Rag-1- pro-B-cells to the small pre-B cell stage, whereas the introduction of independently integrated mu HC and kappa light chain (kappa LC) transgenes promotes the appearance of peripheral lymphocytes which, however, remain unresponsive to external stimuli. Complete reconstitution of the B-cell lineage and the emergence of functionally nature Rag-1- peripheral B cells is achieved by the introduction of cointegrated heavy and light chain transgenes encoding an anti-H-2k antibody. This experimental system demonstrates the competence of the mu HC and kappa LC to direct and regulate the sequential stages of B-cell differentiation, defines the time at which negative selection of self-reactive B cells occurs, and shows that elimination of these cells occurs equally well in the absence of Rag-1 as in its presence. These data also support the hypothesis that Rag-1 directly participates in the V(D)J recombination process.,

    title: Peripheral T Cell Survival Requires Continual Ligation of the T Cell Receptor to Major Histocompatibility Complex–Encoded Molecules,
    abstract: In the thymus, T cells are selected according to their T cell receptor (TCR) specificity. After positive selection, mature cells are exported from primary lymphoid organs to seed the secondary lymphoid tissue. An important question is whether survival of mature T cells is an intrinsic property or requires continuous survival signals, i.e., engagement of the TCR by major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules in the periphery, perhaps in a similar way as occurring during thymic positive selection. To address this issue we used recombination-activating gene (Rag)-deficient H-2b mice expressing a transgenic TCR restricted by I-Ed class II MHC molecules. After engraftment with Rag−/− H-2d fetal thymi, CD4+8− peripheral T cells emerged. These cells were isolated and transferred into immunodeficient hosts of H-2b or H-2d haplotype, some of the latter being common cytokine receptor γ chain deficient to exclude rejection of H-2b donor cells by host natural killer cells. Our results show that in the absence, but not in the presence, of selecting MHC molecules, peripheral mature T cells are short lived and disappear within 7 wk, indicating that continuous contact of the TCR with selecting MHC molecules is required for survival of T cells.,

    title: Foxp3+ CD25- CD4 T cells constitute a reservoir of committed regulatory cells that regain CD25 expression upon homeostatic expansion.,
    abstract: Expression of the IL-2 receptor alpha chain (CD25) by peripheral CD4 T cells follows cellular activation. However, CD25 expression by CD4 cells is widely used as a marker to identify regulatory T cells (T(R)), although cells with regulatory properties are also found in the CD4+CD25- subset. By using in vivo functional assays and Foxp3 expression as a faithful marker of T(R) differentiation, we have evaluated the requirements for CD25 expression by peripheral T(R). We first show that in vivo depletion of CD25+ cells prevents the development of spontaneous encephalomyelitis in recombination-activating gene (RAG)-deficient anti-myelin basic protein T cell antigen receptor (TCR) transgenic mice, and allows disease induction in otherwise healthy RAG-competent transgenic mice. Similar treatment in normal thymectomized animals is followed by the fast recovery of a normal number of CD25+ T(R). Consistently, Foxp3-expressing T(R) encompassed in the CD25- cell population convert to CD25+ after homeostatic expansion and are selectable by IL-2 in vitro. Surface expression of CD25 on T(R) is controlled by the activity of conventional CD4 cells and is fully labile because it can be lost and regained without affecting the functional potential of the cells. These findings reveal that Foxp3-expressing CD25- cells constitute a peripheral reservoir of differentiated T(R), recruited to the CD25+ pool upon homeostatic expansion and/or activation. This analysis, together with the notion that physiological commitment of T(R) takes place exclusively in the thymus should help for the interpretation of experiments assessing peripheral T(R) differentiation from naive CD4 T cells, defined as CD25-.,

    title: CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ Tregs resolve experimental lung injury in mice and are present in humans with acute lung injury.,
    abstract: Acute lung injury (ALI) is characterized by rapid alveolar injury, inflammation, cytokine induction, and neutrophil accumulation. Although early events in the pathogenesis of ALI have been defined, the mechanisms underlying resolution are unknown. As a model of ALI, we administered intratracheal (i.t.) LPS to mice and observed peak lung injury 4 days after the challenge, with resolution by day 10. Numbers of alveolar lymphocytes increased as injury resolved. To examine the role of lymphocytes in this response, lymphocyte-deficient Rag-1-/- and C57BL/6 WT mice were exposed to i.t. LPS. The extent of injury was similar between the groups of mice through day 4, but recovery was markedly impaired in the Rag-1-/- mice. Adoptive transfer studies revealed that infusion of CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ Tregs as late as 24 hours after i.t. LPS normalized resolution in Rag-1-/- mice. Similarly, Treg depletion in WT mice delayed recovery. Treg transfer into i.t. LPS-exposed Rag-1-/- mice also corrected the elevated levels of alveolar proinflammatory cytokines and increased the diminished levels of alveolar TGF-beta and neutrophil apoptosis. Mechanistically, Treg-mediated resolution of lung injury was abrogated by TGF-beta inhibition. Moreover, BAL of patients with ALI revealed dynamic changes in CD3+CD4+CD25hiCD127loFoxp3+ cells. These results indicate that Tregs modify innate immune responses during resolution of lung injury and suggest potential targets for treating ALI, for which there are no specific therapies currently available.,

    title: Notch1 activation increases hematopoietic stem cell self-renewal in vivo and favors lymphoid over myeloid lineage outcome.,
    abstract: Hematopoietic stem cells sequentially pass through a series of decision points affecting self-renewal or lineage-specific differentiation. Notch1 receptor is a known modulator of lineage-specific events in hematopoiesis that we assessed in the context of in vivo stem cell kinetics. Using RAG-1(-/-) mouse stems cells, we documented increased stem cell numbers due to decreased differentiation and enhanced stem cell self-renewal induced by Notch1. Unexpectedly, preferential lymphoid over myeloid lineage commitment was noted when differentiation occurred. Therefore, Notch1 affects 2 decision points in stem cell regulation, favoring self-renewal over differentiation and lymphoid over myeloid lineage outcome. Notch1 offers an attractive target for stem cell manipulation strategies, particularly in the context of immunodeficiency and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome.,

    title: Reexpression of RAG-1 and RAG-2 Genes in Activated Mature Mouse B cells,
    abstract: Recombination activating genes (RAG-1 and RAG-2), involved in V(D)J rearrangement of immunoglobulin genes, have been thought to be expressed only in immature stages of B-cell development. However, RAG-1 and RAG-2 transcripts were found to be reexpressed in mature mouse B cells after culture with interleukin-4 in association with several different co-stimuli. Reexpression was also detected in draining lymph nodes from immunized mice. RAG-1 and RAG-2 proteins could be detected by immunofluorescence microscopy in the nuclei of B cells cultured in vitro and in the germinal centers of draining lymph nodes. These findings suggest that RAG gene products play a heretofore unsuspected role in mature B cells.,

    title: Interleukin-7: a cofactor for V(D)J rearrangement of the T cell receptor beta gene.,
    abstract: The diversity of the T cell receptor repertoire is generated by rearrangement of gene elements in immature thymocytes. To identify a thymic signal that induces this rearrangement, a variety of agents were tested for their ability to induce rearrangement of the T cell receptor beta gene in suspensions of thymocytes from mouse embryos at day 14 of gestation. Of 16 agents tested, only interleukin-7 (IL-7) induced V(D)J gene rearrangement and sustained expression of the RAG-1 and RAG-2 genes, which are known to control rearrangement. These data implicate IL-7, a cytokine that is abundantly expressed in embryonic thymus, in driving gene rearrangement during early T cell development.,

    title: Identification of novel lymphoid tissues in murine intestinal mucosa where clusters of c-kit+ IL-7R+ Thy1+ lympho-hemopoietic progenitors develop,
    abstract: We have revealed that about one and a half thousand tiny clusters, filled with one thousand closely packed lymphocytes, can be found throughout the murine small and large intestinal mucosa. They are located in crypt lamina propria (cryptopatches; CP) and can be first detected at 14-17 d after birth. A large fraction of lymphocytes in CP expresses c-kit, IL-7R, Thy1 and a lymphocyte function-associated antigen, LFA-1, whereas most of them remain CD3-, TCR alpha beta-, TCR gamma delta-, sIgM-, and B220-. The population size of IL-2R alpha+, HSA+ and Pgp-1+ subsets is variable (20-50%) and the composition of CD8+, Ly-1+, and CD4+ subsets is smaller but also variable (3-20%). In the small intestine, CP do not contain cells undergoing apoptosis nor cells bearing RAG-1 molecules, but do contain dendritic stromal cells bearing CD11c/CD18 molecules. The frequency of DNA replicating cells in CP is higher than that in Peyer's patches (PP), is lower than that in the thymic cortex and is almost comparable with that in the thymic medulla. The numbers of CP remain the same in aged mice (> 114 wk) but double after estrogen treatment even though the thymi are attenuated sharply in both conditions. Thus, with respect to histogenesis, lymphocyte composition and tissue level of cellular behavior, neither PP, isolated lymphoid follicles, peripheral LNs, nor thymus are identical with CP. Finally, CP are virtually absent in lamina propria of IL-7R-deficient mice that display a profound reduction in thymic and peripheral lymphoid cellularity. By contrast, CP are present in germ- free mice and in athymic (nu/nu), SCID, TCR beta x delta-/-, RAG-2-/-, PP-deficient (aly/aly), stem cell factor (Sl/Sld) and c-kit (W/Wv) mutant mice. Taking all of these results together, CP are the first identification of gut-associated murine lymphoid tissues where the generation of IL-7-dependent lympho-hematopoietic progenitors for T and/or B cell descendants may start to take place at the age of commencement of weaning.,

    title: Basal divergences in birds and the phylogenetic utility of the nuclear RAG-1 gene.,
    abstract: The single-copy RAG-1 gene is found throughout higher vertebrates and consists of a single 3.1-kb exon without intervening introns. A 2.9-kb region of the RAG-1 locus was sequenced for 14 basal taxa of birds plus the crocodylian outgroups Alligator and Gavialis. Phylogenetic analysis of the sequences supported the hypothesis that the deepest evolutionary split in extant birds separates paleognaths from neognaths. A deep division among neognaths separates the chicken- and duck-like birds ("galloanserines") from a clade consisting of all other birds ("plethornithines"). The relationships of these three basal clades in Aves were supported by high bootstrap (98 to 100%) and large decay index values (above 14). Additionally, the plethornithine clade is characterized by a 15-bp (five-codon) synapomorphic deletion relative to all other birds. RAG-1 evolves slowly, with a number of properties favoring its phylogenetic utility, including rarity of indels, minimal saturation of transition changes at 3rd positions of codons, nearly constant base composition across taxa, and no asymmetry in directional patterns of reconstructed change. However, RAG-1 does not evolve in a clocklike manner, suggesting that this gene cannot easily be used for estimating ages of ancient lineages.,

    title: Alzheimer's disease amyloidogenic glycoprotein: expression pattern in rat brain suggests a role in cell contact.,
    abstract: The cloned cDNA encoding the rat cognate of the human A4 amyloid precursor protein was isolated from a rat brain library. The predicted primary structure of the 695‐amino acid‐long protein displays 97% identity to its human homologue shown previously to resemble an integral membrane protein. The protein was detected in rodent brain and muscle by Western blot analysis. Using in situ hybridization and immunocytochemistry on rat brain sections, we discovered that rat amyloidogenic glycoprotein (rAG) and its mRNA are ubiquitously and abundantly expressed in neurons indicating a neuronal original for the amyloid deposits observed in humans with Alzheimer's disease (AD). The protein appears in patches on or near the plasma membranes of neurons suggesting a role for this protein in cell contact. Highest expression was seen in rat brain regions where amyloid is deposited in AD but also in areas which do not contain deposits in AD. Since amyloid deposits are rarely observed in rat brain, we conclude that high expression of AG is not the sole cause of amyloidosis.,

    title: Inhibition of glioma growth in vivo by selective activation of the CB(2) cannabinoid receptor.,
    abstract: The development of new therapeutic strategies is essential for the management of gliomas, one of the most malignant forms of cancer. We have shown previously that the growth of the rat glioma C6 cell line is inhibited by psychoactive cannabinoids (I. Galve-Roperh et al., Nat. Med., 6: 313-319, 2000). These compounds act on the brain and some other organs through the widely expressed CB(1) receptor. By contrast, the other cannabinoid receptor subtype, the CB(2) receptor, shows a much more restricted distribution and is absent from normal brain. Here we show that local administration of the selective CB(2) agonist JWH-133 at 50 microg/day to Rag-2(-/-) mice induced a considerable regression of malignant tumors generated by inoculation of C6 glioma cells. The selective involvement of the CB(2) receptor in this action was evidenced by: (a) the prevention by the CB(2) antagonist SR144528 but not the CB(1) antagonist SR141716; (b) the down-regulation of the CB(2) receptor but not the CB(1) receptor in the tumors; and (c) the absence of typical CB(1)-mediated psychotropic side effects. Cannabinoid receptor expression was subsequently examined in biopsies from human astrocytomas. A full 70% (26 of 37) of the human astrocytomas analyzed expressed significant levels of cannabinoid receptors. Of interest, the extent of CB(2) receptor expression was directly related with tumor malignancy. In addition, the growth of grade IV human astrocytoma cells in Rag-2(-/-) mice was completely blocked by JWH-133 administration at 50 microg/day. Experiments carried out with C6 glioma cells in culture evidenced the internalization of the CB(2) but not the CB(1) receptor upon JWH-133 challenge and showed that selective activation of the CB(2) receptor signaled apoptosis via enhanced ceramide synthesis de novo. These results support a therapeutic approach for the treatment of malignant gliomas devoid of psychotropic side effects.,

    title: Critical role for the chemokine receptor CXCR 6 in NK cell – mediated antigen-specific memory of haptens and viruses,
    abstract: The textbook view of adaptive immunity is that it is mediated exclusively by T cells and B cells, which rely on nonhomologous recombination of variable, diversity and joining gene segments mediated by the RAG-1–RAG-2 recombinase to generate a diverse repertoire of T cell and B cell antigen receptors1. The activation of such receptors by cognate antigen triggers clonal selection and differentiation into short-lived effector cells and long-lived memory cells that, after antigen rechallenge, mount accelerated and enhanced recall responses. Classic examples of such antigen-specific memory, the hallmark of adaptive immunity, include delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH)2,3 and hapten-induced contact hypersensitivity (CHS)4,5. Like T cells and B cells, natural killer (NK) cells mediate resistance to tumors and infections by a variety of mechanisms that are still incompletely understood6. However, NK cells cannot express RAG-dependent receptors and instead use germline-encoded receptors that integrate activating and dampening signals7. Notable examples of mouse NK cell receptors that detect specific pathogen–associated structures include NKp46 and Ly49H, which recognize influenza A–encoded hemagglutinin (HA)8,9 and the murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV)-encoded m157 protein10, respectively. Mouse NK cells can express just one Ly49 receptor or random combinations of several Ly49 receptors, some of which recognize host major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I (refs.11,12). Ly49H is a member of this family and confers NK cell– mediated resistance to MCMV infection in C57BL/6 mice. Notably, Ly49H+ NK cells develop features of adaptive immunity after infection with this virus13. However, as Ly49H is found only in the C57BL/6 strain14, it has been unclear whether NK cells can develop virus-specific memory in other genetic backgrounds or in response to viruses other than MCMV. This question may also be clinically relevant, as certain NK cell subsets have been linked to the ability of rare people infected with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) to exert long-term control over HIV-1 replication15,16. The idea that NK cells can mediate adaptive immunity was initially suggested by observations that mouse strains that lack T cells and B cells develop vigorous CHS responses to various distinct haptens17,18. These responses have the hallmarks of adaptive immunity: they are sensitization dependent, persist for at least 4 weeks and are elicited only by haptens to which mice have previously been sensitized17. Several lines of evidence have established that NK cells are necessary and sufficient for this activity: CHS responses in mice deficient in recombination-activating gene 2 (Rag2−/− mice) are abolished after depletion of NK cells and are absent from Rag2−/− mice also deficient in the gene encoding the γ-chain of the interleukin 2 (IL-2) receptor (Il2rg−/− mice), which lack all lymphocytes, including NK cells19. Moreover, after sensitization of donor mice with 2,4dinitro-1-fluorobenzene (DNFB), adoptive transfer of NK cells from donor livers confers vigorous CHS to naive Rag2−/−Il2rg−/− recipient mice but adoptive transfer of NK cells from spleens does not. Among hepatic NK cells, DNFB-specific memory is concentrated in a subset expressing Thy-1 and Ly49C/I17. However, those and all other NK,

    title: The lysosomal Rag-Ragulator complex licenses RIPK1– and caspase-8–mediated pyroptosis by Yersinia,
    abstract: Cell death limits pathogens During infection, Yersinia inhibition of the protein kinase TAK1 triggers cleavage of the pore-forming protein gasdermin D (GSDMD), which leads to a kind of inflammatory cell death called pyroptosis. In a genome-wide screen, Zheng et al. identified a lysosome-tethered regulatory supercomplex as being a critical driver of Yersinia-induced pyroptosis. The activity of the GTPase Rag and lysosomal tethering of Rag-Ragulator were required to recruit and activate the kinase RIPK1 and protease caspase-8 to cleave GSDMD, which causes cell death and limits infection. By contrast, Rag-Ragulator was not required for inflammasome-mediated pyroptosis. Thus, metabolic signaling on lysosomes can regulate cell death during pathogenic bacterial infection. Science, abg0269, this issue p. eabg0269 The lysosomal metabolic signaling regulator Rag-Ragulator instructs the host inflammatory response to the pathogenic bacterium Yersinia. INTRODUCTION An inflammatory innate immune response is a first line of host defense against invading pathogens. Inflammation recruits immune cells to the infection site and activates protective adaptive immune responses. Invasive bacteria have evolved multiple ways to interfere with host innate immune signaling to facilitate infection. The Yersinia effector protein YopJ suppresses proinflammatory cytokine production by inhibiting transforming growth factor–β–activated kinase 1 (TAK1) and nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) activation. To counteract this virulence factor, host cells initiate receptor-interacting serine-threonine protein kinase 1 (RIPK1)–dependent caspase-8–directed gasdermin D (GSDMD) cleavage and inflammatory cell death (pyroptosis) when TAK1 is inhibited. However, how the RIPK1–caspase-8–GSDMD axis is instructed during Yersinia infection is unclear. RATIONALE The best-studied mechanism by which pathogens stimulate inflammatory cell death involves triggering cytosolic sensors, called inflammasomes, which activate inflammatory caspases (1/4/5/11) to process proinflammatory cytokines and cause pyroptosis. Inflammatory caspase cleavage of GSDMD causes cell membrane pores that mediate both pyroptosis and proinflammatory cytokine secretion. An alternate pyroptotic pathway, mediated by activation of RIPK1 and caspase-8, is triggered when the YopJ virulence factor secreted during pathogenic Yersinia infection blocks TAK1 activation. To determine the molecular mechanisms underlying Yersinia activation of RIPK1–caspase-8–dependent pyroptosis, we performed a genome-wide CRISPR screen using Cas9-expressing immortalized mouse bone marrow–derived macrophages infected with a genome-wide library of single-guide RNA–encoding lentiviruses. The genomes of cells resistant to caspase-8– or caspase-11–dependent pyroptosis were sequenced to identify the knocked-out genes required for pyroptosis. RESULTS The screen identified multiple genes in the lysosomal membrane–anchored Folliculin (Flcn)–Folliculin-interacting protein 2 (Fnip2)–Rag-Ragulator complex as necessary for caspase-8– but not caspase-11–mediated pyroptosis. Deficiency of Rag-Ragulator complex genes rendered cells highly resistant to TAK1 inhibition–triggered pyroptosis, indicating a critical and unexpected role of the lysosomal membrane–tethered Rag-Ragulator supercomplex in RIPK1-dependent caspase-8–directed pyroptosis. In response to pathogenic Yersinia or its mimic [lipopolysaccharide (LPS) plus TAK1 inhibitor], a Fas-associated death domain (FADD)–RIPK1–caspase-8–containing complex was recruited to lysosomal membrane–tethered Rag-Ragulator. Activation of RIPK1 phosphorylation, caspase-8 activation, and pyroptosis depended on Rag guanosine triphosphatase (GTPase) activity and Rag-Ragulator lysosomal binding but was independent of the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1), a well-known Rag-Ragulator–regulated complex. By contrast, Rag-Ragulator did not regulate canonical or noncanonical inflammasome-triggered pyroptosis. CONCLUSION Our study revealed an instructive role of metabolic signaling in directing TAK1 inhibition–induced pyroptosis during a pathogenic bacterial infection. Rag-Ragulator is a well-known critical regulator of cellular responses to changes in nutrient availability and metabolism. Here, Rag-Ragulator served as a platform for activating a FADD–RIPK1–caspase-8 complex formed in response to Toll-like receptor (TLR) or tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR) ligation. Rag GTPase activity was critical for triggering the pathway. The role found here for Rag-Ragulator in pyroptosis expands its known roles in metabolic regulation to include regulation of the response to pathogenic infection. Rag-Ragulator monitors both metabolism and infection to serve as a central hub for helping to decide whether available nutrients are adequate for cell proliferation and if an infected cell should die and send out inflammatory danger signals. Future studies can further explore the conditions that stimulate caspase-8–mediated pyroptosis and provide more mechanistic details of how it is regulated, as well as investigate whether manipulating this pathway could have therapeutic benefit. Rag-Ragulator serves as a platform for activating a FADD–RIPK1–caspase-8 complex to trigger pyroptosis in response to TLR and TNFR ligation. When TAK1 is inhibited by the Yersinia effector YopJ or its mimic 5z-7-oxozeaenol (5z7), a FADD–RIPK1–caspase-8–containing complex is recruited to lysosome-tethered Rag-Ragulator, which activates caspase-8– and GSDMD-dependent pyroptosis. TNFRSF, TNFR superfamily; L1-5, Lamtor1-5. Host cells initiate cell death programs to limit pathogen infection. Inhibition of transforming growth factor–β–activated kinase 1 (TAK1) by pathogenic Yersinia in macrophages triggers receptor-interacting serine-threonine protein kinase 1 (RIPK1)–dependent caspase-8 cleavage of gasdermin D (GSDMD) and inflammatory cell death (pyroptosis). A genome-wide CRISPR screen to uncover mediators of caspase-8–dependent pyroptosis identified an unexpected role of the lysosomal folliculin (FLCN)–folliculin-interacting protein 2 (FNIP2)–Rag-Ragulator supercomplex, which regulates metabolic signaling and the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1). In response to Yersinia infection, Fas-associated death domain (FADD), RIPK1, and caspase-8 were recruited to Rag-Ragulator, causing RIPK1 phosphorylation and caspase-8 activation. Pyroptosis activation depended on Rag guanosine triphosphatase activity and lysosomal tethering of Rag-Ragulator but not mTORC1. Thus, the lysosomal metabolic regulator Rag-Ragulator instructs the inflammatory response to Yersinia.,

In particular, in this study we show that Treg directly inhibit NKG2D-mediated NK cell cytotoxicity in vitro and in vivo, effectively suppressing NK cell-mediated tumor rejection. In vitro, Treg were shown to inhibit NKG2D-mediated cytolysis largely by a TGF-β-dependent mechanism and independently of IL-10. Adoptively transferred Treg suppressed NK cell antimetastatic function in RAG-1-deficient mice. Depletion of Treg before NK cell activation via NKG2D and the activating IL-12 cytokine, dramatically enhanced NK cell-mediated suppression of tumor growth and metastases. Our data illustrate at least one mechanism by which Treg can suppress NK cell antitumor activity and highlight the effectiveness of combining Treg inhibition with subsequent NK cell activation to promote strong innate antitumor immunity.,

    title: T helper cell 1-type CD4+ T cells, but not B cells, mediate colitis in interleukin 10-deficient mice,
    abstract: Mice rendered deficient in the production of interleukin 10 (IL-10-/-) develop a chronic inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) that predominates in the colon and shares histopathological features with human IBD. Our aim was to identify which cell type(s) can mediate colitis in IL-10-/- mice. We detected an influx of immunoglobulin-positive cells into the colon and the presence of colon-reactive antibodies in the serum of IL- 10-/- mice. To assess a pathogenic role for B cells, we generated a B cell-deficient (B-/-) strain of IL-10-/- mice. B-/-IL-10-/- mice acquired a severe colitis analogous to that IL-10-/- mice, implying that B cells were not the primary mediator of IBD in this model. A series of cell transfer experiments was performed to assess a pathogenic role for T cells. When IL-10-/- T cell-enriched lamina propria lymphocytes (LPL) or intraepithelial lymphocytes (IEL) were transferred into immunodeficient recombinase-activating gene (RAG)-2-/- recipients, a mild to severe colitis developed, depending on the cell number transferred. Lymphocytes recovered from the colon of transplanted RAG-2-/- mice with colitis were predominantly alpha beta TCR+CD4+, including a large proportion of CD4+CD8 alpha + cells. These cells were also CD45RB-/low and CD44+, indicative of an activated/memory population. Individual populations of CD4+CD8 alpha-, CD4+CD8 alpha + and CD4-CD8 alpha + T cells were then isolated from the lamina propria compartment of IL-10-/- mice and transferred into RAG-2- /- recipients. Only IL-10-/- CD4-expressing LPL, including both the CD4+CD8 alpha- and CD4+CD8 alpha + populations, induced colitis in recipient mice. Interferon-gamma, but little to no IL-4, was produced by CD4+CD8 alpha- and CD4+CD8 alpha + LPL recovered from the inflamed colons of RAG-2-/- recipients implicating alpha T helper cell 1 (TH1)- mediated response. We thus conclude that colitis in IL-10-/- mice is predominantly mediated by TH1-type alpha beta TCR+ T cells expressing CD4 alone, or in combination with the CD8 alpha molecule.,

    title: Altered T cell development in mice with a targeted mutation of the CD3‐epsilon gene.,
    abstract: To determine which CD3 components are required for early T cell development, we generated mice with a targeted mutation of the CD3‐epsilon gene and characterized their T cell populations relative to those found in CD3‐zeta/eta‐and recombinase activating gene (RAG)‐deficient mice. In the absence of intact CD3‐epsilon subunit, thymocytes do not progress beyond the CD44‐/lowCD25+ triple‐negative stage and appear to be arrested at the very same developmental control point as RAG‐deficient thymocytes. In contrast, the disruption of the CD3‐epsilon/eta gene does not totally abrogate the progression through this control point. CD3‐epsilon‐deficient thymocytes do rearrange their T cell receptor (TCR) beta gene segments and produce low levels of full‐length TCR beta transcripts. Taken together, these results establish an essential role for the CD3‐epsilon gene products during T cell development and further suggest that the CD3‐epsilon polypeptides start to exert their function as part of a pre‐TCR through which CD44‐/lowCD25+ triple‐negative cells monitor the occurrence of productive TCR beta gene rearrangements. Finally, the absence of intact CD3‐epsilon polypeptides had no discernible effect on the completion of TCR gamma and TCR delta gene rearrangements, emphasizing that they are probably not subjected to the same epigenetic controls as those operating on the expression of TCR alpha and beta genes.,

    title: Regulation of V(D)J recombination activator protein RAG-2 by phosphorylation.,
    abstract: Antigen receptor genes are assembled by site-specific DNA rearrangement. The recombination activator genes RAG-1 and RAG-2 are essential for this process, termed V(D)J rearrangement. The activity and stability of the RAG-2 protein have now been shown to be regulated by phosphorylation. In fibroblasts RAG-2 was phosphorylated predominantly at two serine residues, one of which affected RAG-2 activity in vivo. The threonine at residue 490 was phosphorylated by p34cdc2 kinase in vitro; phosphorylation at this site in vivo was associated with rapid degradation of RAG-2. Instability was transferred to chimeric proteins by a 90-residue portion of RAG-2. Mutation of the p34cdc2 phosphorylation site of the tumor suppressor protein p53 conferred a similar phenotype, suggesting that this association between phosphorylation and degradation is a general mechanism.,

    title: A critical role for the programmed death ligand 1 in fetomaternal tolerance,
    abstract: Fetal survival during gestation implies that tolerance mechanisms suppress the maternal immune response to paternally inherited alloantigens. Here we show that the inhibitory T cell costimulatory molecule, programmed death ligand 1 (PDL1), has an important role in conferring fetomaternal tolerance in an allogeneic pregnancy model. Blockade of PDL1 signaling during murine pregnancy resulted in increased rejection rates of allogeneic concepti but not syngeneic concepti. Fetal rejection was T cell– but not B cell–dependent because PDL1-specific antibody treatment caused fetal rejection in B cell–deficient but not in RAG-1–deficient females. Blockade of PDL1 also resulted in a significant increase in the frequency of IFN-γ–producing lymphocytes in response to alloantigen in an ELISPOT assay and higher IFN-γ levels in placental homogenates by ELISA. Finally, PDL1-deficient females exhibited decreased allogeneic fetal survival rates as compared with littermate and heterozygote controls and showed evidence of expansion of T helper type 1 immune responses in vivo. These results provide the first evidence that PDL1 is involved in fetomaternal tolerance.,

    title: Overexpression of Bcl-2 in transgenic mice decreases apoptosis and improves survival in sepsis.,
    abstract: In sepsis there is extensive apoptosis of lymphocytes, which may be beneficial by down-regulating the accompanying inflammation. Alternatively, apoptosis may be detrimental by impairing host defense. We studied whether Bcl-2, a potent antiapoptotic protein, could prevent lymphocyte apoptosis in a clinically relevant model of sepsis. Transgenic mice in which Bcl-2 was overexpressed in T cells had complete protection against sepsis-induced T lymphocyte apoptosis in thymus and spleen. Surprisingly, there was also a decrease in splenic B cell apoptosis in septic Bcl-2 overexpressors compared with septic HeJ and HeOuJ mice. There were marked increases in TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, and IL-10 in thymic tissue in sepsis in the three species of mice, and the increase in TNF-alpha and IL-10 in HeOuJ mice was greater than that in Bcl-2 mice. Mitotracker, a mitochondrial membrane potential indicator, demonstrated a sepsis-induced loss of membrane potential in T cells in HeJ and HeOuJ mice but not in Bcl-2 mice. Importantly, Bcl-2 overexpressors also had improved survival in sepsis. To investigate the potential impact of loss of lymphocytes on survival in sepsis, Rag-1-/- mice, which are totally deficient in mature T and B cells, were also studied. Rag-1-/- mice had decreased survival compared with immunologically normal mice with sepsis. We conclude that overexpression of Bcl-2 provides protection against cell death in sepsis. Lymphocyte death may be detrimental in sepsis by compromising host defense.,

    title: Double-strand signal sequence breaks in V(D)J recombination are blunt, 5'-phosphorylated, RAG-dependent, and cell cycle regulated.,
    abstract: Immunoglobulin and T-cell receptor genes are assembled during lymphocyte development by a novel, highly regulated series of gene rearrangement reactions known as V(D)J recombination. All rearranging loci are flanked by conserved heptamer-nonamer recombination signal sequences. Gene rearrangement results in the imprecise fusion of coding sequences and the precise fusion of signal sequences. DNA molecules with double-stranded breaks near signal sequences have been detected in cells undergoing V(D)J recombination of the TCR delta locus. We have devised a ligation-mediated PCR assay that detects broken-ended molecules in purified genomic DNA. Using this assay we found that DNA breaks occurring precisely at the signal sequence-coding sequence junction are a general feature of V(D)J recombination, appearing in association with each type of rearranging immunoglobulin gene segment. We show that a significant fraction of these broken ends are blunt and 5'-phosphorylated. In addition, detection of these broken-ended signal sequences is dependent on the activity of RAG-1 and RAG-2, and is restricted to the G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle. The pattern of broken-ended molecules detected in cells at various stages of development reflects the activity of the V(D)J recombinase at different loci during B- and T-cell development.,

    title: Regulation of Experimental Autoimmune Encephalomyelitis by Natural Killer (NK) Cells,
    abstract: In this report, we establish a regulatory role of natural killer (NK) cells in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a prototype T helper cell type 1 (Th1)-mediated disease. Active sensitization of C57BL/6 (B6) mice with the myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG)35-55 peptide induces a mild form of monophasic EAE. When mice were deprived of NK cells by antibody treatment before immunization, they developed a more serious form of EAE associated with relapse. Aggravation of EAE by NK cell deletion was also seen in β2-microglobulin−/− (β2m−/−) mice, indicating that NK cells can play a regulatory role in a manner independent of CD8+ T cells or NK1.1+ T cells (NK–T cells). The disease enhancement was associated with augmentation of T cell proliferation and production of Th1 cytokines in response to MOG35-55. EAE passively induced by the MOG35-55-specific T cell line was also enhanced by NK cell deletion in B6, β2m−/−, and recombination activation gene 2 (RAG-2)−/− mice, indicating that the regulation by NK cells can be independent of T, B, or NK–T cells. We further showed that NK cells inhibit T cell proliferation triggered by antigen or cytokine stimulation. Taken together, we conclude that NK cells are an important regulator for EAE in both induction and effector phases.,

    title: Repopulation of mouse liver with human hepatocytes and in vivo infection with hepatitis B virus,
    abstract: Mice containing livers repopulated with human hepatocytes would provide excellent in vivo models for studies on human liver diseases and hepatotropic viruses, for which no permissive cell lines exist. Here, we report partial repopulation of the liver of immunodeficient urokinase‐type plasminogen activator (uPA)/recombinant activation gene‐2 (RAG‐2) mice with normal human hepatocytes isolated from the adult liver. In the transplanted mice, the production of human albumin was demonstrated, indicating that human hepatocytes remained functional in the mouse liver for at least 2 months after transplantation. Inoculation of transplanted mice with human hepatitis B virus (HBV) led to the establishment of productive HBV infection. According to human‐specific genomic DNA analysis and immunostaining of cryostat liver sections, human hepatocytes were estimated to constitute up to 15% of the uPA/RAG‐2 mouse liver. This is proof that normal human hepatocytes can integrate into the mouse hepatic parenchyma, undergo multiple cell divisions, and remain permissive for a human hepatotropic virus in a xenogenic liver. This system will provide new opportunities for studies on etiology and therapy of viral and nonviral human liver diseases, as well as on hepatocyte biology and hepatocellular transplantation.

    title: Fundamental signals that regulate eosinophil homing to the gastrointestinal tract.,
    abstract: The histological identification of increased eosinophils in the gastrointestinal tract occurs in numerous clinical disorders; however, there is a limited understanding of the mechanisms regulating eosinophil trafficking into this mucosal surface. The results presented in this study characterize the processes regulating eosinophil homing into the gastrointestinal tract at baseline. Eosinophils were found to be present in the lamina propria of 19-day-old embryos and germ-free adult mice at concentrations comparable to those present in non-germ-free adult mice. Furthermore, eosinophil gastrointestinal levels were not altered by increasing circulating eosinophils after pulmonary allergen challenge. Gastrointestinal eosinophil levels were partially reduced in mice deficient in recombinase activating gene-1 (RAG-1), IL-5, or the beta common chain (betac), but these reductions paralleled reductions in circulating eosinophils. In contrast, mice deficient in eotaxin had a marked reduction in gastrointestinal eosinophils but normal levels of eosinophils in the hematopoietic compartments. Furthermore, eotaxin was important for regulating eosinophil levels, even in the presence of high levels of IL-5. These investigations demonstrate eosinophil homing into the gastrointestinal tract during embryonic development occurring independently of viable intestinal flora. Furthermore, eotaxin is identified as the primary regulator of eosinophil gastrointestinal homing under homeostatic states, and may therefore have a fundamental role in innate immune responses.,

    title: Amino acid regulation of TOR complex 1.,
    abstract: TOR complex 1 (TORC1), an oligomer of the mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) protein kinase, its substrate binding subunit raptor, and the polypeptide Lst8/GbetaL, controls cell growth in all eukaryotes in response to nutrient availability and in metazoans to insulin and growth factors, energy status, and stress conditions. This review focuses on the biochemical mechanisms that regulate mTORC1 kinase activity, with special emphasis on mTORC1 regulation by amino acids. The dominant positive regulator of mTORC1 is the GTP-charged form of the ras-like GTPase Rheb. Insulin, growth factors, and a variety of cellular stressors regulate mTORC1 by controlling Rheb GTP charging through modulating the activity of the tuberous sclerosis complex, the Rheb GTPase activating protein. In contrast, amino acids, especially leucine, regulate mTORC1 by controlling the ability of Rheb-GTP to activate mTORC1. Rheb binds directly to mTOR, an interaction that appears to be essential for mTORC1 activation. In addition, Rheb-GTP stimulates phospholipase D1 to generate phosphatidic acid, a positive effector of mTORC1 activation, and binds to the mTOR inhibitor FKBP38, to displace it from mTOR. The contribution of Rheb's regulation of PL-D1 and FKBP38 to mTORC1 activation, relative to Rheb's direct binding to mTOR, remains to be fully defined. The rag GTPases, functioning as obligatory heterodimers, are also required for amino acid regulation of mTORC1. As with amino acid deficiency, however, the inhibitory effect of rag depletion on mTORC1 can be overcome by Rheb overexpression, whereas Rheb depletion obviates rag's ability to activate mTORC1. The rag heterodimer interacts directly with mTORC1 and may direct mTORC1 to the Rheb-containing vesicular compartment in response to amino acid sufficiency, enabling Rheb-GTP activation of mTORC1. The type III phosphatidylinositol kinase also participates in amino acid-dependent mTORC1 activation, although the site of action of its product, 3'OH-phosphatidylinositol, in this process is unclear.,

    title: Spontaneous Autoimmune Diabetes in Monoclonal T Cell Nonobese Diabetic Mice,
    abstract: It has been established that insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) in nonobese diabetic (NOD) mice results from a CD4+ and CD8+ T cell–dependent autoimmune process directed against the pancreatic beta cells. The precise roles that beta cell–reactive CD8+ and CD4+ T cells play in the disease process, however, remain ill defined. Here we have investigated whether naive beta cell–specific CD8+ and CD4+ T cells can spontaneously accumulate in pancreatic islets, differentiate into effector cells, and destroy beta cells in the absence of other T cell specificities. This was done by introducing Kd– or I-Ag7–restricted beta cell–specific T cell receptor (TCR) transgenes that are highly diabetogenic in NOD mice (8.3- and 4.1-TCR, respectively), into recombination-activating gene (RAG)-2–deficient NOD mice, which cannot rearrange endogenous TCR genes and thus bear monoclonal TCR repertoires. We show that while RAG-2−/− 4.1-NOD mice, which only bear beta cell–specific CD4+ T cells, develop diabetes as early and as frequently as RAG-2+ 4.1-NOD mice, RAG-2−/− 8.3-NOD mice, which only bear beta cell–specific CD8+ T cells, develop diabetes less frequently and significantly later than RAG-2+ 8.3-NOD mice. The monoclonal CD8+ T cells of RAG-2−/− 8.3-NOD mice mature properly, proliferate vigorously in response to antigenic stimulation in vitro, and can differentiate into beta cell–cytotoxic T cells in vivo, but do not efficiently accumulate in islets in the absence of a CD4+ T cell–derived signal, which can be provided by splenic CD4+ T cells from nontransgenic NOD mice. These results demonstrate that naive beta cell– specific CD8+ and CD4+ T cells can trigger diabetes in the absence of other T or B cell specificities, but suggest that efficient recruitment of naive diabetogenic beta cell–reactive CD8+ T cells to islets requires the assistance of beta cell–reactive CD4+ T cells.,

    title: Structural basis for the docking of mTORC1 on the lysosomal surface,
    abstract: Complex regulation The protein kinase mTORC1 controls cellular growth in response to external signals. In the presence of nutrients, it localizes on the surface of the lysosome, where it is activated. The Raptor domain of mTORC1 binds to a complex comprising the protein Ragulator and a heterodimer of the Rag guanosine triphosphatase, which can adopt four different nucleotide conformations depending on nutrient availability. Rogala et al. determined the structure of the Raptor-Rag-Ragulator complex at 3.2-angstrom resolution by cryo–electron microscopy. The structure shows why Raptor binds only to a specific nucleotide conformation of the Rag heterodimer and suggests a model for how mTORC1 would dock onto the lysosomal surface, which is a key step in its activation. Science, this issue p. 468 mTORC1 senses nutrient sufficiency by recognizing conformational changes in its lysosomal anchor, heterodimeric Rag GTPase. The mTORC1 (mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1) protein kinase regulates growth in response to nutrients and growth factors. Nutrients promote its translocation to the lysosomal surface, where its Raptor subunit interacts with the Rag guanosine triphosphatase (GTPase)–Ragulator complex. Nutrients switch the heterodimeric Rag GTPases among four different nucleotide-binding states, only one of which (RagA/B•GTP–RagC/D•GDP) permits mTORC1 association. We used cryo–electron microscopy to determine the structure of the supercomplex of Raptor with Rag-Ragulator at a resolution of 3.2 angstroms. Our findings indicate that the Raptor α-solenoid directly detects the nucleotide state of RagA while the Raptor “claw” threads between the GTPase domains to detect that of RagC. Mutations that disrupted Rag-Raptor binding inhibited mTORC1 lysosomal localization and signaling. By comparison with a structure of mTORC1 bound to its activator Rheb, we developed a model of active mTORC1 docked on the lysosome.,

    title: RAG-1 interacts with the repeated amino acid motif of the human homologue of the yeast protein SRP1.,
    abstract: Genes for immunoglobulins and T-cell receptor are generated by a process known as V(D)J recombination. This process is highly regulated and mediated by the recombination activating proteins RAG-1 and RAG-2. By the use of the two-hybrid protein interaction system, we isolated a human protein that specifically interacts with RAG-1. This protein is the human homologue of the yeast SRP1 (suppressor of a temperature-sensitive RNA polymerase I mutation). The SRP1-1 mutation is an allele-specific dominant suppressor of a temperature-sensitive mutation in the zinc binding domain of the 190-kDa subunit of Saccharomyces cerevisiae RNA polymerase I. The human SRP cDNA clone was used to screen a mouse cDNA library. We obtained a 3.9-kbp cDNA clone encoding the mouse SRP1. The open reading frame of this cDNA encodes a 538-amino acid protein with eight degenerate repeats of 40-45 amino acids each. The mouse and human SRP1 are 98% identical, while the mouse and yeast SRP1 have 48% identity. After cotransfection of the genes encoding RAG-1 and human SRP1 into 293T cells, a stable complex was evident. Deletion analysis indicated that the region of the SRP1 protein interacting with RAG-1 involved four repeats. The domain of RAG-1 that associates with SRP1 mapped N-terminal to the zinc finger domain. Because this region of RAG-1 is not required for recombination and SRP1 appears to be bound to the nuclear envelope, we suggest that this interaction helps to localize RAG-1.,

    title: RAGS TO RAGS: Poverty and Mobility in the United States,
    abstract: Early arguments over the “culture of poverty” assumed considerable intergenerational transmission of poverty but differed over whether this was due to cultural inadequacies of the poor or to structural barriers and discrimination faced by the poor. These arguments subsided by the 1970s when quantitative social stratification studies such as Blau & Duncan (1967) found that intergenerational socioeconomic mobility was considerable and that there was little evidence for a “vicious cycle of poverty.” In the 1980s the issue of intergenerational poverty reemerged when research on new longitudinal datasets suggested that both intragenerational and intergenerational poverty were more persistent than analyses based on cross-sectional data had suggested. Four new theoretical perspectives were developed to explain intergenerational poverty: the resources model, the correlated disadvantages model, the welfare culture model, and Wilson’s (1987) underclass model.

    title: Apoptosis in lymphoid and parenchymal cells during sepsis: findings in normal and T- and B-cell-deficient mice.,
    abstract: OBJECTIVES
To determine if apoptosis (programmed cell death) occurs systemically in lymphoid and parenchymal cells during sepsis. To examine the potential role of T and B cells in the apoptotic process using knockout mice deficient in mature T and B lymphocytes.


DESIGN
Prospective, randomized, controlled trial.


SETTING
Animal laboratory in a university medical setting.


INTERVENTIONS
Cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) (n = 34) or sham surgery (n = 13) was performed in female ND4 mice and, 15 to 22 hrs postoperatively, thymus, lung, heart, spleen, ileum, colon, liver, kidney, brain, and muscle were obtained and examined for apoptosis. A second group of mice (Rag-1) which are totally deficient in mature T and B cells also underwent CLP (n = 14) or sham surgery (n = 14) and had examination of tissues for apoptosis.


MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS
Four methods with varying sensitivities and specificities were used to detect apoptosis, including: a) DNA agarose gel electrophoresis; b) terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL); c) electron microscopy; and d) light microscopy. In CLP mice, multiple methods demonstrated apoptosis in lymphocytes in thymus, spleen, ileum, colon, lung, and skeletal muscle. In addition to lymphocytes, parenchymal cells in ileum, colon, lung, and to a lesser extent, in skeletal muscle and kidney were apoptotic in CLP mice. There was no evidence of apoptosis by any method of detection in liver, brain, or heart. Results in Rag-1 mice which are deficient in T and B cells demonstrated extensive apoptosis in thymus, spleen, and ileum with less degrees of apoptosis in colon and lung. Both lymphoid cells and parenchymal cells were apoptotic. Rag-1 mice which underwent CLP did not die prematurely and there were no apparent observable differences in the physical response (tachypnea, piloerection, lethargy, etc), or intra-abdominal bowel inflammation/adhesions compared with CLP mice with normal T and B cells.


CONCLUSIONS
Apoptosis is an important mechanism of cell death in lymphocytes and parenchymal cells in sepsis and occurs systemically in many organs. Apoptosis may be an important cause of immunologic suppression in sepsis by inducing widespread lymphocyte depletion. Alternately, apoptosis may be beneficial to host survival by down-regulating the inflammatory response which accompanies sepsis. The degree to which parenchymal cell apoptosis is contributing to multiple organ failure cannot be determined from the present study. Findings in Rag-1 mice demonstrate that mature T and B cells and their secretory products are not necessary for apoptosis to occur during sepsis and that apoptotic cell death is not restricted to T or B cells. Apoptosis may be a key regulator of the balance between the pro- and anti-inflammatory process.,

    title: Emulsifier of Arthrobacter RAG-1: isolation and emulsifying properties,
    abstract: The oil-degrading Arthrobacter sp. RAG-1 produced an extracellular nondialyzable emulsifying agent when grown on hexadecane, ethanol, or acetate medium. The emulsifier was prepared by two procedures: (i) heptane extraction of the cell-free culture medium and (ii) precipitation with ammonium sulfate. A convenient assay was developed for measurement of emulsifier concentrations between 3 and 75 micrograms/ml. The rate of emulsion fromation was proportional to both hydrocarbon and emulsifier concentrations. Above pH 6, activity was dependent upon divalent cations; half-maximum activity was obtained in the presence of 1.5 mM Mg2+. With a ratio of gas oil to emulsifier of 50, stable emulsions were formed with average droplet sizes of less than 1 micron. Emulsifier production was parallel to growth on either hydrocarbon or nonhydrocarbon substrates during the exponential phase; however, production continued after growth ceased.,

    title: IL-17 producing innate lymphoid cells and the NLRP3 inflammasome facilitate obesity-associated airway hyperreactivity,
    abstract: Obesity is associated with the development of asthma and considerable asthma-related healthcare utilization. To understand the immunological pathways that lead to obesity-associated asthma, we fed mice a high fat diet for 12 weeks, which resulted in obesity and the development of airway hyperreactivity (AHR), a cardinal feature of asthma. This AHR depended on innate immunity, since it occurred in obese Rag −/− mice, and on IL-17A and the NLRP3 inflammasome, since it did not develop in obese Il17 −/− or Nlrp3 −/− mice. The AHR was also associated with the presence in the lungs of CCR6 + innate lymphoid cells producing IL-17A (ILC3 cells), which could by themselves mediate AHR when adoptively transferred into Rag2 −/− Il2r γ −/− mice. IL-1 β played an important role by expanding the ILC3 cells, and treatment to block the function of IL-1 β abolished obesity-induced AHR. Since we found ILC3-like cells in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of human patients with asthma, we suggest that obesity-associated asthma is facilitated inflammation,

    title: Vitamin D Is Required for ILC3 Derived IL-22 and Protection From Citrobacter rodentium Infection,
    abstract: Citrobacter rodentium is a gastrointestinal infection that requires early IL-22 from group 3 innate lymphoid cells (ILC3) for resistance. The role of vitamin D in the clearance of C. rodentium infection was tested in vitamin D sufficient (D+) and vitamin D deficient (D-) wildtype (WT) and Cyp27B1 (Cyp) KO mice (unable to produce the high affinity vitamin D ligand 1,25(OH)2D, 1,25D). Feeding Cyp KO mice D- diets reduced vitamin D levels and prevented synthesis of 1,25D. D- (WT and Cyp KO) mice had fewer ILC3 cells and less IL-22 than D+ mice. D- Cyp KO mice developed a severe infection that resulted in the lethality of the mice by d14 post-infection. T and B cell deficient D- Rag KO mice also developed a severe and lethal infection with C. rodentium compared to D+ Rag KO mice. D- WT mice survived the infection but took significantly longer to clear the C. rodentium infection than D+ WT or D+ Cyp KO mice. Treating infected D- Cyp KO mice with IL-22 protected the mice from lethality. Treating the D- WT mice with 1,25D reconstituted the ILC3 cells in the colon and protected the mice from C. rodentium. IL-22 treatment of D- WT mice eliminated the need for vitamin D to clear the C. rodentium infection. Vitamin D is required for early IL-22 production from ILC3 cells and protection from enteric infection with C. rodentium.,

    title: Suppressive Role of B Cells in Chronic Colitis of  T Cell Receptor α Mutant Mice,
    abstract: The role of antibodies (Abs) in the development of chronic colitis in T cell receptor (TCR)-α−/− mice was explored by creating double mutant mice (TCR-α−/− × immunoglobulin (Ig)μ−/−), which lack B cells. TCR-α−/− × Igμ−/− mice spontaneously developed colitis at an earlier age, and the colitis was more severe than in TCR-α−/− mice. Colitis was induced in recombination-activating gene-1 (RAG-1−/−) mice by the transfer of mesenteric lymph node (MLN) cells from TCR-α−/− × Igμ−/− mice. When purified B cells from TCR-α−/− mice were mixed with MLN cells before cell transfer, colitis did not develop in RAG-1−/− mice. Administration of the purified Ig from TCR-α−/− mice and a mixture of monoclonal autoAbs reactive with colonic epithelial cells led to attenuation of colitis in TCR-α−/− × Igμ−/− mice. Apoptotic cells were increased in the colon, MLN, and spleen of TCR-α−/− × Igμ−/− mice as compared to Igμ−/− mice and TCR-α−/− mice. Administration of the purified Ig from TCR-α−/− mice into TCR-α−/− × Igμ−/− mice led to decrease in the number of apoptotic cells. These findings suggest that although B cells are not required for the initiation of colitis, B cells and Igs (autoAbs) can suppress colitis, presumably by affecting the clearance of apoptotic cells.,

    title: Music Cognition and Perceptual Facilitation: A Connectionist Framework,
    abstract: The mind internalizes persistent structural regularities in music and recruits these internalized representations to facilitate subsequent perception. Facilitation underlies the generation of musical expectations and implications and the influence of a musical context on consonance and memory. Facilitation is demonstrated in experiments showing priming of chords: chords that are harmonically closely related to a preceding context are processed more quickly than chords that are harmonically distant from the context. A tonal context enhances intonational sensitivity for related chords and heightens their consonance. Facilitation occurs even when related chords don9t share component tones with the context, and even when overlapping harmonics are eliminated. These results point to the indirect activation of representational units at a cognitive level. In a parallel study conducted in India, tones considered to play an important role in a rag but absent from the experimental rendition of that rag were facilitated in the same way. In a connectionist framework, facilitation is a consequence of activation spreading through a network of representational units whose pattern of connectivity encodes musical relationships. In a proposed connectionist model of harmony, each event in a musical sequence activates tone units, and activation spreads via connecting links to parent chord units and then to parent key units. Activation reverberates bidirectionally until the network settles into a state of equilibrium. The initial stages of the activation process constitute the bottom-up influence of the sounded tones, while the later, reverberatory stages constitute the top-down influence of learned, schematic structures internalized at the cognitive level. Computer simulations of the model show the same pattern of data as human subjects in experiments on relatedness judgments of chords and memory for chord sequences.,

    title: Spatially and temporally regulated expression of rice MADS box genes with similarity to Arabidopsis class A, B and C genes.,
    abstract: The floral morphology of grass species is distinct from that of typical dicot plants. In order to achieve a better understanding of the molecular basis for this diversion, we isolated RAP1A, RAP1B and RAG, putative rice orthologs for the Arabidopsis class A gene APETALA1 (AP1) and class C gene AGAMOUS (AG). The expression patterns of RAP1A, RAG and OsMADS2, a rice ortholog of the class B gene, were analyzed by in situ hybridization. RAP1A mRNA was expressed in the apical region of the floral meristem at an early stage of spikelet development, and then its expression was localized in developing lemma, palea and lodicules. The OsMADS2 transcript was first observed in the region where stamen primordia are formed. Soon after, OsMADS2 mRNA appeared in the lodicule primordia as well as the stamen primordia, and this RNA accumulation pattern persisted until late stages of floral development. The expression of RAG was observed in stamens and pistils of wild-type young spikelets. These RNA accumulation patterns are mostly similar to those of Arabidopsis class A, B, C genes, supporting the notion that the ABC model may be extended to rice.,

    title: T-cell receptor alpha locus V(D)J recombination by-products are abundant in thymocytes and mature T cells,
    abstract: In addition to the assembled coding regions of immunoglobulin and T-cell receptor (TCR) genes, the V(D)J recombination reaction can in principle generate three types of by-products in normal developing lymphocytes: broken DNA molecules that terminate in a recombination signal sequence or a coding region (termed signal or coding end molecules, respectively) and DNA molecules containing fused recombination signal sequences (termed reciprocal products). Using a quantitative Southern blot analysis of the murine TCR alpha locus, we demonstrate that substantial amounts of signal end molecules and reciprocal products, but not coding end molecules, exist in thymocytes, while peripheral T cells contain substantial amounts of reciprocal products. At the 5' end of the J alpha locus, 20% of thymus DNA exists as signal end molecules. An additional 30 to 40% of the TCR alpha/delta locus exists as remarkably stable reciprocal products throughout T-cell development, with the consequence that the TCR C delta region is substantially retained in alpha beta committed T cells. The disappearance of the broken DNA molecules occurs in the same developmental transition as termination of expression of the recombination activating genes, RAG-1 and RAG-2. These findings raise important questions concerning the mechanism of V(D)J recombination and the maintenance of genome integrity during lymphoid development.,

    title: Homeostasis of Peripheral B Cells in the Absence of B Cell Influx from the Bone Marrow,
    abstract: To study homeostasis of peripheral B lymphocytes in the absence of B cell influx from the bone marrow, we generated a mouse mutant in which the recombination-activating gene (RAG)-2 can be inducibly deleted. When RAG-2 was deleted at the age of 8–10 wk, splenic naive follicular B cells were gradually lost over a year of observation, with a half-life of ∼4.5 mo. By contrast, the pool of marginal zone B cells in the spleen and of B-1 cells in the peritoneal cavity were kept at normal level. In lymph nodes, ∼90% of the B cells were lost within 4 mo, and B cell numbers remained constant thereafter. Mice in which RAG-2 was deleted at birth maintained a small population of activated B cells with an increased proportion of marginal zone B cells. Additionally, an increase of the pool of IgM secreting cells and B-1a cells was observed.,

    title: Glycaemic index of cereal products explained by their content of rapidly and slowly available glucose,
    abstract: Elucidating the role of carbohydrate quality in human nutrition requires a greater understanding of how the physico-chemical characteristics of foods relate to their physiological properties. It was hypothesised that rapidly available glucose (RAG) and slowly available glucose (SAG), in vitro measures describing the rate of glucose release from foods, are the main determinants of glycaemic index (GI) and insulinaemic index (II) for cereal products. Twenty-three products (five breakfast cereals, six bakery products and crackers, and twelve biscuits) had their GI and II values determined, and were characterised by their fat, protein, starch and sugar contents, with the carbohydrate fraction further divided into total fructose, RAG, SAG and resistant starch. Relationships between these characteristics and GI and II values were investigated by regression analysis. The cereal products had a range of GI (28–93) and II (61–115) values, which were positively correlated (r2 0·22, P<0·001). The biscuit group, which had the highest SAG content (8·6 (sd 3·7) g per portion) due to the presence of ungelatinised starch, was found to have the lowest GI value (51 (sd 14)). There was no significant association between GI and either starch or sugar, while RAG was positively (r2 0·54, P<0·001) and SAG was negatively (r2 0·63, P<0·001) correlated with GI. Fat was correlated with GI (r2 0·52, P<0·001), and combined SAG and fat accounted for 73·1 % of the variance in GI, with SAG as the dominant variable. RAG and protein together contributed equally in accounting for 45·0 % of the variance in II. In conclusion, the GI and II values of the cereal products investigated can be explained by the RAG and SAG contents. A high SAG content identifies low-GI foods that are rich in slowly released carbohydrates for which health benefits have been proposed.,

    title: Benchmarking Large Language Models in Retrieval-Augmented Generation,
    abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a promising approach for mitigating the hallucination of large language models (LLMs). However, existing research lacks rigorous evaluation of the impact of retrieval-augmented generation on different large language models, which make it challenging to identify the potential bottlenecks in the capabilities of RAG for different LLMs. In this paper, we systematically investigate the impact of Retrieval-Augmented Generation on large language models. We analyze the performance of different large language models in 4 fundamental abilities required for RAG, including noise robustness, negative rejection, information integration, and counterfactual robustness. To this end, we establish Retrieval-Augmented Generation Benchmark (RGB), a new corpus for RAG evaluation in both English and Chinese. RGB divides the instances within the benchmark into 4 separate testbeds based on the aforementioned fundamental abilities required to resolve the case. Then we evaluate 6 representative LLMs on RGB to diagnose the challenges of current LLMs when applying RAG. Evaluation reveals that while LLMs exhibit a certain degree of noise robustness, they still struggle significantly in terms of negative rejection, information integration, and dealing with false information. The aforementioned assessment outcomes indicate that there is still a considerable journey ahead to effectively apply RAG to LLMs.,

    title: Interleukin 12–dependent Interferon γ Production by CD8α+Lymphoid Dendritic Cells,
    abstract: We investigated the role of antigen-presenting cells in early interferon (IFN)-γ production in normal and recombinase activating gene 2–deficient (Rag-2−/−) mice in response to Listeria monocytogenes (LM) infection and interleukin (IL)-12 administration. Levels of serum IFN-γ in Rag-2−/− mice were comparable to those of normal mice upon either LM infection or IL-12 injection. Depletion of natural killer (NK) cells by administration of anti-asialoGM1 antibodies had little effect on IFN-γ levels in the sera of Rag-2−/− mice after LM infection or IL-12 injection. Incubation of splenocytes from NK cell–depleted Rag-2−/− mice with LM resulted in the production of IFN-γ that was completely blocked by addition of anti–IL-12 antibodies. Both dendritic cells (DCs) and monocytes purified from splenocytes were capable of producing IFN-γ when cultured in the presence of IL-12. Intracellular immunofluorescence analysis confirmed the IFN-γ production from DCs. It was further shown that IFN-γ was produced predominantly by CD8α+ lymphoid DCs rather than CD8α− myeloid DCs. Collectively, our data indicated that DCs are potent in producing IFN-γ in response to IL-12 produced by bacterial infection and play an important role in innate immunity and subsequent T helper cell type 1 development in vivo.,

    title: Rch1, a protein that specifically interacts with the RAG-1 recombination-activating protein.,
    abstract: RAG1 and RAG2 are lymphoid-specific genes that together induce V(D)J recombinase activity in a variety of nonlymphoid cell types. While no other lymphoid-specific factors are required to induce recombination, other factors with more widespread expression patterns have been implicated in the reaction. However, none of these factors have been cloned, and their relationship to the RAG proteins is unclear. Using the yeast two-hybrid assay, we have identified RCH1, a gene encoding a protein of molecular weight 58,000 that interacts specifically with RAG-1. The predicted Rch1 protein sequence is 47% identical to yeast SRP1, a protein associated with the nuclear envelope. A truncated form of Rch1, which retains the ability to interact with RAG-1, reduces V(D)J recombination activity in HeLa cells.,

    title: Measurement of rapidly available glucose (RAG) in plant foods: a potential in vitro predictor of the glycaemic response,
    abstract: Abstract The glycaemic index (GI) is an in vivo measurement based on the glycaemicresponse to carbohydrate-containing foods, and allows foods to be ranked on the basis of the rate of digestion and absorption of the carbohydrates that they contain. GI values are normalizedto a reference amount of available carbohydrate and do not reflect the amounts of carbohydrate normally present in foods; for example, a food with a low content of carbohydrates will have a high GI value if that carbohydrate is digested and absorbed rapidly in the human small intestine. This is potentially confusing for a person wishing to control his or her blood glucoselevels by the choice of foods. The rate and extent of starch digestion in vitro has been measured using a technique that classifies starch into three major fractions: rapidly digestible starch (RDS), slowly digestible starch (SDS) and resistant starch (RS). In addition, thistechnique gives a value for rapidly available glucose (RAG), which includes RDS, free glucose and the glucose moiety of sucrose. When the values for thirty-nine foods were expressed on the basis ofthe available carbohydrate content of these foods, highly significant (P<0·001) positive correlations were observed between GI and both RDS and RAG. The measurement of RAGin vitro provides values for direct calculation of the amount of glucose likely to be rapidly absorbed in the human small intestine and,thus, to influence blood glucose and insulin levels. These values can be used to compare foods, as eaten,on an equal-weight basis. Food-table RAG values would allow simple calculation of the total amount of RAG provided by single foods, by whole meals and by whole diets. Studies are planned in which RAG and the glycaemic response in man will be measured for identical food products.,

    title: Ku70 Is Required for Late B Cell Development and Immunoglobulin Heavy Chain Class Switching,
    abstract: Immunoglobulin (Ig) heavy chain (HC) class switch recombination (CSR) is a late B cell process that involves intrachromosomal DNA rearrangement. Ku70 and Ku80 form a DNA end-binding complex required for DNA double strand break repair and V(D)J recombination. Ku70−/− (K70T) mice, like recombination activating gene (RAG)-1– or RAG-2–deficient (R1T or R2T) mice, have impaired B and T cell development at an early progenitor stage, which is thought to result at least in part from defective V(D)J recombination (Gu, Y., K.J. Seidl, G.A. Rathbun, C. Zhu, J.P. Manis, N. van der Stoep, L. Davidson, H.L. Cheng, J.M. Sekiguchi, K. Frank, et al. 1997. Immunity. 7:653–665; Ouyang, H., A. Nussenzweig, A. Kurimasa, V.C. Soares, X. Li, C. Cordon-Cardo, W. Li, N. Cheong, M. Nussenzweig, G. Iliakis, et al. 1997. J. Exp. Med. 186:921–929). Therefore, to examine the potential role of Ku70 in CSR, we generated K70T mice that carry a germline Ig HC locus in which the JH region was replaced with a functionally rearranged VH(D)JH and Ig λ light chain transgene (referred to as K70T/HL mice). Previously, we have shown that B cells from R1T or R2T mice carrying these rearranged Ig genes (R1T/HL or R2T/HL mice) can undergo CSR to IgG isotypes (Lansford, R., J. Manis, E. Sonoda, K. Rajewsky, and F. Alt. 1998. Int. Immunol. 10:325–332). K70T/HL mice had significant numbers of peripheral surface IgM+ B cells, which generated serum IgM levels similar to those of R2T/HL mice. However, in contrast to R2T/HL mice, K70T/HL mice had no detectable serum IgG isotypes. In vitro culture of K70T/HL B cells with agents that induce CSR in normal or R2T/HL B cells did lead to the induction of germline CH transcripts, indicating that initial signaling pathways for CSR were intact in K70T/HL cells. However, treatment with such agents did not lead to detectable CSR by K70T/HL B cells, and instead, led to cell death within 72 h. We conclude that Ku70 is required for the generation of B cells that have undergone Ig HC class switching. Potential roles for Ku70 in the CSR process are discussed.,

    title: Onset of TCR-beta gene rearrangement and role of TCR-beta expression during CD3-CD4-CD8- thymocyte differentiation.,
    abstract: TCR-beta gene rearrangement or expression is necessary and sufficient for the progression of early alpha beta thymocyte differentiation from the CD3-CD4-CD8- triple negative (TN)3 to the CD4+CD8+ double positive stage. The onset of TCR-beta rearrangement is currently thought to occur gradually. Some thymocytes were reported to be rearranged at the earliest (CD44+CD25-) TN stage, whereas other thymocytes did not initiate TCR-beta rearrangement until the latest (CD44-CD25-) TN stage. Here, we have isolated subsets of TN thymocytes on the basis of surface expression of CD44 and CD25, with c-kit as an additional marker. We present a revised model of early T cell development in which TCR-beta and TCR-gamma rearrangements occur abruptly, at the CD44lowCD25+ c-kitlowTN stage. A high level of c-kit expression defines pro-T cells which have not yet rearranged their TCR genes. Germ-line TCR-beta transcripts, and transcripts of recombination activating genes (RAG)-1 and 2, are detected before TCR-beta gene rearrangement. Analyses of TN thymocytes of RAG-1 mutant mice, and of various TCR mutant and TCR transgenic RAG-1 mutant mice, indicate the existence of a control point at the CD44-CD25+TN stage at which cells expressing a productively rearranged TCR-beta chain are selected for further differentiation.,

    title: V(D)J recombination defects in lymphocytes due to RAG mutations: severe immunodeficiency with a spectrum of clinical presentations.,
    abstract: Severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) comprises a heterogeneous group of primary immunodeficiencies, a proportion of which are due to mutations in either of the 2 recombination activating genes (RAG)-1 and -2, which mediate the process of V(D)J recombination leading to the assembly of antigen receptor genes. It is reported here that the clinical and immunologic phenotypes of patients bearing mutations in RAGs are more diverse than previously thought and that this variability is related, in part, to the specific type of RAG mutation. By analyzing 44 such patients from 41 families, the following conclusions were reached: (1) null mutations on both alleles lead to the T-B-SCID phenotype; (2) patients manifesting classic Omenn syndrome (OS) have missense mutations on at least one allele and maintain partial V(D)J recombination activity, which accounts for the generation of residual, oligoclonal T-lymphocytes; (3) in a third group of patients, findings were only partially compatible with OS, and these patients, who also carried at least one missense mutation, may be considered to have atypical SCID/OS; (4) patients with engraftment of maternal T cells as a complication of a transplacental transfusion represented a fourth group, and these patients, who often presented with a clinical phenotype mimicking OS, may be observed regardless of the type of RAG gene mutation. Analysis of the RAG genes by direct sequencing is an effective way to provide accurate diagnosis of RAG-deficient as opposed to RAG-independent V(D)J recombination defects, a distinction that cannot be made based on clinical and immunologic phenotype alone.,

    abstract: T cells that express IL-17 infiltrate the kidneys of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus. A significant proportion of these cells are CD3+CD4−CD8− double-negative T cells. In this study, we show that double-negative T cells from MRL/lpr mice express high amounts of IL-17 and that as disease progressively worsens, the expression of IL-17 and of IL-23 receptor in lymphocytes from these mice increases. Lymph node cells from lupus-prone mice, but not control mice, treated in vitro with IL-23 induce nephritis when transferred to non-autoimmune, lymphocyte-deficient Rag-1−/− mice. Kidney specimens from these recipient mice show significant Ig and complement deposition. The data indicate that an aberrantly active IL-23/IL-17 axis contributes to the development of nephritis in lupus-prone mice.,

    abstract: Both innate and adaptive mechanisms participate in the pathogenesis of kidney ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI), but the role of regulatory immune mechanisms is unknown. We hypothesized that the anti-inflammatory effects of CD4(+)CD25(+)FoxP3(+) regulatory T cells (Tregs) protect against renal IRI. Partial depletion of Tregs with an anti-CD25 mAb potentiated kidney damage induced by IRI. Reducing the number of Tregs resulted in more neutrophils, macrophages, and innate cytokine transcription in the kidney after IRI but did not affect CD4(+) T cells or B cells. We performed adoptive transfer of lymph node cells from wild-type mice or FoxP3-deficient Scurfy mice into T cell- and B cell-deficient RAG-1 knockout mice to generate mice with and without FoxP3(+) Tregs, respectively. FoxP3(+) Treg-deficient mice accumulated a greater number of inflammatory leukocytes after renal IRI than mice containing Tregs. To confirm that a lack of Tregs potentiated renal injury, we co-transferred isolated Tregs and Scurfy lymph node cells; Treg repletion significantly attenuated IRI-induced renal injury and leukocyte accumulation. Furthermore, although adoptive transfer of wild-type Tregs into RAG-1 knockout mice was sufficient to prevent kidney IRI, transfer of IL-10-deficient Tregs was not. Taken together, these results demonstrate that Tregs modulate injury after kidney IRI through IL-10-mediated suppression of the innate immune system.,

    title: A Role for CCR9 in T Lymphocyte Development and Migration1,
    abstract: CCR9 mediates chemotaxis in response to CCL25/thymus-expressed chemokine and is selectively expressed on T cells in the thymus and small intestine. To investigate the role of CCR9 in T cell development, the CCR9 gene was disrupted by homologous recombination. B cell development, thymic αβ-T cell development, and thymocyte selection appeared unimpaired in adult CCR9-deficient (CCR9−/−) mice. However, competitive transplantation experiments revealed that bone marrow from CCR9−/− mice was less efficient at repopulating the thymus of lethally irradiated Rag-1−/− mice than bone marrow from littermate CCR9+/+ mice. CCR9−/− mice had increased numbers of peripheral γδ-T cells but reduced numbers of γδTCR+ and CD8αβ+αβTCR+ intraepithelial lymphocytes in the small intestine. Thus, CCR9 plays an important, although not indispensable, role in regulating the development and/or migration of both αβ− and γδ− T lymphocytes.,

    title: Discovering Discriminative Graphlets for Aerial Image Categories Recognition,
    abstract: Recognizing aerial image categories is useful for scene annotation and surveillance. Local features have been demonstrated to be robust to image transformations, including occlusions and clutters. However, the geometric property of an aerial image (i.e., the topology and relative displacement of local features), which is key to discriminating aerial image categories, cannot be effectively represented by state-of-the-art generic visual descriptors. To solve this problem, we propose a recognition model that mines graphlets from aerial images, where graphlets are small connected subgraphs reflecting both the geometric property and color/texture distribution of an aerial image. More specifically, each aerial image is decomposed into a set of basic components (e.g., road and playground) and a region adjacency graph (RAG) is accordingly constructed to model their spatial interactions. Aerial image categories recognition can subsequently be casted as RAG-to-RAG matching. Based on graph theory, RAG-to-RAG matching is conducted by comparing all their respective graphlets. Because the number of graphlets is huge, we derive a manifold embedding algorithm to measure different-sized graphlets, after which we select graphlets that have highly discriminative and low redundancy topologies. Through quantizing the selected graphlets from each aerial image into a feature vector, we use support vector machine to discriminate aerial image categories. Experimental results indicate that our method outperforms several state-of-the-art object/scene recognition models, and the visualized graphlets indicate that the discriminative patterns are discovered by our proposed approach.,

    title: Ciliary Photoreceptors with a Vertebrate-Type Opsin in an Invertebrate Brain,
    abstract: For vision, insect and vertebrate eyes use rhabdomeric and ciliary photoreceptor cells, respectively. These cells show distinct architecture and transduce the light signal by different phototransductory cascades. In the marine rag-worm Platynereis, we find both cell types: rhabdomeric photoreceptor cells in the eyes and ciliary photoreceptor cells in the brain. The latter use a photopigment closely related to vertebrate rod and cone opsins. Comparative analysis indicates that both types of photoreceptors, with distinct opsins, coexisted in Urbilateria, the last common ancestor of insects and vertebrates, and sheds new light on vertebrate eye evolution.,

    title: Coordinate regulation of RAG1 and RAG2 by cell type-specific DNA elements 5' of RAG2.,
    abstract: RAG1 and RAG2 are essential for V(D)J recombination and lymphocyte development. These genes are thought to encode a transposase derived from a mobile genetic element that was inserted into the vertebrate genome 450 million years ago. The regulation of RAG1 and RAG2 was investigated in vivo with bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) transgenes containing a fluorescent indicator. Coordinate expression of RAG1 and RAG2 in B and T cells was found to be regulated by distinct genetic elements found on the 5' side of the RAG2 gene. This observation suggests a mechanism by which asymmetrically disposed cis DNA elements could influence the expression of the primordial transposon and thereby capture RAGs for vertebrate evolution.,

    title: Structural mechanism of a Rag GTPase activation checkpoint by the lysosomal folliculin complex,
    abstract: Cellular response to nutrient status An intricate regulatory mechanism is taking shape around control of the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) protein kinase complex. Physiological responses of cells to nutrient abundance is regulated by signaling through mTORC1, which interacts with a complex of other proteins at the lysosome that includes small guanosine triphosphatases (GTPases), GTPase-activating proteins, and others. Lawrence et al. present a cryo–electron microscopy structure and biochemical experiments that reveal that the small GTPases act in unanticipated ways in the complex. The tumor suppressor folliculin (FLCN), along with FLCN-interacting protein 2, interacts with its partner GTPase RagC in both active and inactive states, suggesting that a particularly elaborate and stringent regulatory mechanism is at work. Science, this issue p. 971 An elaborate set of protein interactions controls nutrient sensing at the lysosome. The tumor suppressor folliculin (FLCN) enables nutrient-dependent activation of the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) protein kinase via its guanosine triphosphatase (GTPase) activating protein (GAP) activity toward the GTPase RagC. Concomitant with mTORC1 inactivation by starvation, FLCN relocalizes from the cytosol to lysosomes. To determine the lysosomal function of FLCN, we reconstituted the human lysosomal FLCN complex (LFC) containing FLCN, its partner FLCN-interacting protein 2 (FNIP2), and the RagAGDP:RagCGTP GTPases as they exist in the starved state with their lysosomal anchor Ragulator complex and determined its cryo–electron microscopy structure to 3.6 angstroms. The RagC-GAP activity of FLCN was inhibited within the LFC, owing to displacement of a catalytically required arginine in FLCN from the RagC nucleotide. Disassembly of the LFC and release of the RagC-GAP activity of FLCN enabled mTORC1-dependent regulation of the master regulator of lysosomal biogenesis, transcription factor E3, implicating the LFC as a checkpoint in mTORC1 signaling.,

    title: Engagement of the T-cell receptor during positive selection in the thymus down-regulates RAG-1 expression.,
    abstract: We have examined the expression of the recombination activating gene RAG-1 by in situ hybridization to thymi from mice bearing transgenes for the T-cell receptor (TCR) alpha chain, TCR beta chain, or both TCR alpha and beta chains. RAG-1 transcription was found in the thymic cortex of transgenic mice carrying a single TCR alpha- or TCR beta-chain transgene, comparable to normal mice. However, RAG-1 transcription was strikingly reduced in the thymic cortex from transgenic mice carrying both TCR alpha- and beta-chain genes and expressing major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I (H-2b) molecules necessary for positive selection of the transgenic TCR. In contrast, thymi of transgenic mice also carrying both TCR alpha- and beta-chain genes but expressing MHC molecules (H-2d) that did not positively select the transgenic TCR displayed high levels of RAG-1 transcription. The low thymic RAG-1 expression coincided with high transgenic TCR alpha-chain surface expression and with inhibition of endogenous TCR alpha-chain rearrangement. Our findings suggest that binding of the TCR to self MHC molecules during positive selection down-regulates RAG-1 transcription in cortical thymocytes and thereby prevents further TCR alpha-chain rearrangements.,

    title: Tonal hierarchies in the music of north India.,
    abstract: Cross-culturally, most music is tonal in the sense that one particular tone, called the tonic, provides a focus around which the other tones are organized. The specific organizational structures around the tonic show considerable diversity. Previous studies of the perceptual response to Western tonal music have shown that listeners familiar with this musical tradition have internalized a great deal about its underlying organization. Krumhansl and Shepard (1979) developed a probe tone method for quantifying the perceived hierarchy of stability of tones. When applied to Western tonal contexts, the measured hierarchies were found to be consistent with music-theoretic accounts. In the present study, the probe tone method was used to quantify the perceived hierarchy of tones of North Indian music. Indian music is tonal and has many features in common with Western music. One of the most significant differences is that the primary means of expressing tonality in Indian music is through melody, whereas in Western music it is through harmony (the use of chords). Indian music is based on a standard set of melodic forms (called rags), which are themselves built on a large set of scales (thats). The tones within a rag are thought to be organized in a hierarchy of importance. Probe tone ratings were given by Indian and Western listeners in the context of 10 North Indian rags. These ratings confirmed the predicted hierarchical ordering. Both groups of listeners gave the highest ratings to the tonic and the fifth degree of the scale. These tones are considered by Indian music theorists to be structurally significant, as they are immovable tones around which the scale system is constructed, and they are sounded continuously in the drone. Relatively high ratings were also given to the vadi tone, which is designated for each rag and is given emphasis in the melody. The ratings of both groups of listeners generally reflected the pattern of tone durations in the musical contexts. This result suggests that the distribution of tones in music is a psychologically effective means of conveying the tonal hierarchy to listeners whether they are familiar with the musical tradition. Beyond this, only the Indian listeners were sensitive to the scales (thats) underlying the rags. For Indian listeners, multidimensional scaling of the correlations between the rating profiles recovered the theoretical representation of scales described by theorists of Indian music.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS),

    title: Ragulator and SLC38A9 activate the Rag GTPases through noncanonical GEF mechanisms,
    abstract: Significance Amino acids are basic building blocks for all organisms and are essential for cell growth and proliferation. Cells use a set of protein machines to sense the availability of amino acids to carry out basic responses. In particular, the mTORC1 pathway is a central sensor of amino acids in mammalian cells. Residing on the lysosomal surface upon activation, mTORC1 processes signals from the upstream Rag GTPases and stimulates downstream effectors through phosphorylation cascades. Ragulator and SLC38A9 are key components of the lysosomal branch of the amino acid-sensing machinery upstream of the Rag GTPases, but how they regulate the Rag GTPases at the molecular level remains poorly understood. Here we used kinetic analyses to define their functions. The mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) growth pathway detects nutrients through a variety of sensors and regulators that converge on the Rag GTPases, which form heterodimers consisting of RagA or RagB tightly bound to RagC or RagD and control the subcellular localization of mTORC1. The Rag heterodimer uses a unique “locking” mechanism to stabilize its active (GTPRagA–RagCGDP) or inactive (GDPRagA–RagCGTP) nucleotide states. The Ragulator complex tethers the Rag heterodimer to the lysosomal surface, and the SLC38A9 transmembrane protein is a lysosomal arginine sensor that upon activation stimulates mTORC1 activity through the Rag GTPases. How Ragulator and SLC38A9 control the nucleotide loading state of the Rag GTPases remains incompletely understood. Here we find that Ragulator and SLC38A9 are each unique guanine exchange factors (GEFs) that collectively push the Rag GTPases toward the active state. Ragulator triggers GTP release from RagC, thus resolving the locked inactivated state of the Rag GTPases. Upon arginine binding, SLC38A9 converts RagA from the GDP- to the GTP-loaded state, and therefore activates the Rag GTPase heterodimer. Altogether, Ragulator and SLC38A9 act on the Rag GTPases to activate the mTORC1 pathway in response to nutrient sufficiency.,

    title: Calibration choice, rate smoothing, and the pattern of tetrapod diversification according to the long nuclear gene RAG-1.,
    abstract: A phylogeny of tetrapods is inferred from nearly complete sequences of the nuclear RAG-1 gene sampled across 88 taxa encompassing all major clades, analyzed via parsimony and Bayesian methods. The phylogeny provides support for Lissamphibia, Theria, Lepidosauria, a turtle-archosaur clade, as well as most traditionally accepted groupings. This tree allows simultaneous molecular clock dating for all tetrapod groups using a set of well-corroborated calibrations. Relaxed clock (PLRS) methods, using the amniote = 315 Mya (million years ago) calibration or a set of consistent calibrations, recovers reasonable divergence dates for most groups. However, the analysis systematically underestimates divergence dates within archosaurs. The bird-crocodile split, robustly documented in the fossil record as being around approximately 245 Mya, is estimated at only approximately 190 Mya, and dates for other divergences within archosaurs are similarly underestimated. Archosaurs, and particulary turtles have slow apparent rates possibly confounding rate modeling, and inclusion of calibrations within archosaurs (despite their high deviances) not only improves divergence estimates within archosaurs, but also across other groups. Notably, the monotreme-therian split ( approximately 210 Mya) matches the fossil record; the squamate radiation ( approximately 190 Mya) is younger than suggested by some recent molecular studies and inconsistent with identification of approximately 220 and approximately 165 Myo (million-year-old) fossils as acrodont iguanians and approximately 95 Myo fossils colubroid snakes; the bird-lizard (reptile) split is considerably older than fossil estimates (< or = 285 Mya); and Sphenodon is a remarkable phylogenetic relic, being the sole survivor of a lineage more than a quarter of a billion years old. Comparison with other molecular clock studies of tetrapod divergences suggests that the common practice of enforcing most calibrations as minima, with a single liberal maximal constraint, will systematically overestimate divergence dates. Similarly, saturation of mitochondrial DNA sequences, and the resultant greater compression of basal branches means that using only external deep calibrations will also lead to inflated age estimates within the focal ingroup.,

    title: Probabilistic Graphlet Transfer for Photo Cropping,
    abstract: As one of the most basic photo manipulation processes, photo cropping is widely used in the printing, graphic design, and photography industries. In this paper, we introduce graphlets (i.e., small connected subgraphs) to represent a photo's aesthetic features, and propose a probabilistic model to transfer aesthetic features from the training photo onto the cropped photo. In particular, by segmenting each photo into a set of regions, we construct a region adjacency graph (RAG) to represent the global aesthetic feature of each photo. Graphlets are then extracted from the RAGs, and these graphlets capture the local aesthetic features of the photos. Finally, we cast photo cropping as a candidate-searching procedure on the basis of a probabilistic model, and infer the parameters of the cropped photos using Gibbs sampling. The proposed method is fully automatic. Subjective evaluations have shown that it is preferred over a number of existing approaches.,

We report that the Nijmegen breakage syndrome protein (NBS1) and histone γ-H2AX, which associate with irradiation-induced DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs), are also found at sites of V(D)J (variable, diversity, joining) recombination–induced DSBs. In developing thymocytes, NBS1 and γ-H2AX form nuclear foci that colocalize with the T cell receptor α locus in response to recombination activating gene (RAG) protein–mediated V(D)J cleavage. Our results suggest that surveillance of T cell receptor recombination intermediates by NBS1 and γ-H2AX may be important for preventing oncogenic translocations.,

    title: Induction of Early B Cell Factor (EBF) and Multiple B Lineage Genes by the Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factor E12,
    abstract: The transcription factors encoded by the E2A and early B cell factor (EBF) genes are required for the proper development of B lymphocytes. However, the absence of B lineage cells in E2A- and EBF-deficient mice has made it difficult to determine the function or relationship between these proteins. We report the identification of a novel model system in which the role of E2A and EBF in the regulation of multiple B lineage traits can be studied. We found that the conversion of 70Z/3 pre-B lymphocytes to cells with a macrophage-like phenotype is associated with the loss of E2A and EBF. Moreover, we show that ectopic expression of the E2A protein E12 in this macrophage line results in the induction of many B lineage genes, including EBF, IL7Rα, λ5, and Rag-1, and the ability to induce κ light chain in response to mitogen. Activation of EBF may be one of the critical functions of E12 in regulating the B lineage phenotype since expression of EBF alone leads to the activation of a subset of E12-inducible traits. Our data demonstrate that, in the context of this macrophage line, E12 induces expression of EBF and together these transcription factors coordinately regulate numerous B lineage–associated genes.,

    title: Crystal structure of the human lysosomal mTORC1 scaffold complex and its impact on signaling,
    abstract: Structure of human mTORC1 components The mTORC1 (mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1) complex garners much attention as a signaling hub that coordinates input from growth-factor receptors and nutrient availability with metabolism and cell growth and proliferation. de Araujo et al. report the crystal structure of the LAMTOR (or “Ragulator”) complex that helps assemble mTORC1 at the lysosomal membrane for activation. The structure and functional studies reveal how LAMTOR1 wraps around the other subunits to hold them in place and interacts with the Rag guanosine triphosphatases in the complex. Science, this issue p. 377 Structural insights into nutrient and growth factor signaling at the lysosome. The LAMTOR [late endosomal and lysosomal adaptor and MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase) and mTOR (mechanistic target of rapamycin) activator] complex, also known as “Ragulator,” controls the activity of mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) on the lysosome. The crystal structure of LAMTOR consists of two roadblock/LC7 domain–folded heterodimers wrapped and apparently held together by LAMTOR1, which assembles the complex on lysosomes. In addition, the Rag guanosine triphosphatases (GTPases) associated with the pentamer through their carboxyl-terminal domains, predefining the orientation for interaction with mTORC1. In vitro reconstitution and experiments with site-directed mutagenesis defined the physiological importance of LAMTOR1 in assembling the remaining components to ensure fidelity of mTORC1 signaling. Functional data validated the effect of two short LAMTOR1 amino acid regions in recruitment and stabilization of the Rag GTPases.,

    title: Alternative Activation Is an Innate Response to Injury That Requires CD4+ T Cells to be Sustained during Chronic Infection1,
    abstract: Alternatively activated macrophages (AAMΦ) are found in abundance during chronic Th2 inflammatory responses to metazoan parasites. Important roles for these macrophages are being defined, particularly in the context of Th2-mediated pathology and fibrosis. However, a full understanding of the requirements for alternative activation, particularly at the innate level, is lacking. We present evidence that alternative activation by the Th2 cytokines IL-4 and IL-13 is an innate and rapid response to tissue injury that takes place even in the absence of an infectious agent. This early response does not require CD4+ Th2 cells because it occurred in RAG-deficient mice. However, class II-restricted CD4+ T cell help is essential to maintain AAMΦ in response to infection, because AAMΦ were absent in RAG-deficient and MHC class II-deficient, but not B cell-deficient mice after chronic exposure to the nematode parasite, Brugia malayi. The absence of AAMΦ was associated with increased neutrophilia and reduced eosinophilia, suggesting that AAMΦ are involved in the clearance of neutrophils as well as the recruitment of eosinophils. Consistent with this hypothesis, AAMΦ show enhanced phagocytosis of apoptotic neutrophils, but not latex beads. Our data demonstrate that alternative activation by type 2 cytokines is an innate response to injury that can occur in the absence of an adaptive response. However, analogous to classical activation by microbial pathogens, Th2 cells are required for maintenance and full activation during the ongoing response to metazoan parasites.,

    title: Cell expansion and growth arrest phases during the transition from precursor (CD4-8-) to immature (CD4+8+) thymocytes in normal and genetically modified mice.,
    abstract: T cell early precursors belong to the CD3-CD4-CD8- triple negative (TN) thymocyte population that can be subdivided on the basis of CD44, CD25, and heat-stable Ag (HSA) expression. The kinetics and precursor product relationships of these subsets, as well as of the CD4/8low intermediates, were studied by using pulse labeling with bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd). The highest frequencies of DNA-synthesizing cells were found in CD44+CD25+ and CD44-CD25low or CD25- subsets. The major TN cell type (CD44-CD25high), as well as CD44+ CD25-HSAlow early precursors, contained a majority of resting cells. RAG-2-/- mice contained less cells in DNA synthesis than normal mice, and CD44-CD25-/low cells were absent. In female mice transgenic for the anti-HYTCR, CD44-CD25high cells were almost all cycling, but a high percentage of resting cells was found in CD44-CD25- cells. In days following the BrdUrd pulse, there was a reduction in the number of BrdUrd+ cells in most subsets, with the exception of the labeled CD44-CD25high cells that showed a bell-shaped curve. The kinetics and cell size evolution suggest that the majority of these cells do not give rise to CD4+CD8+ cells. In RAG-2-/- cells, the block at the CD44-CD25high stage involved all cells. In TCR transgenic (Tg) mice, no block was seen at the CD44-CD25high stage, suggesting that early expression of a complete TCR receptor precludes the normal selection step. However, another block in the differentiation process was observed at the CD44-CD25- step in TCR Tg mice, suggesting an additional selection point.,

    title: Competition for self ligands restrains homeostatic proliferation of naive CD4 T cells,
    abstract: T cell antigen receptor (TCR) diversity is a critical feature of adaptive immunity. However, restriction of TCR diversity is a potential risk during immune reconstitution by homeostatic proliferation. What peripheral mechanisms are in place to maintain TCR diversity during recovery from lymphopenia? Here, we examine competition between several monoclonal CD4 T cell populations in RAG−/− and TCR Tg RAG−/− environments. The results suggest that specific self ligands constitute a critical limiting resource essential for homeostatic proliferation of naive CD4 T cells. In addition, T cells ignore large numbers of competitors as long as their TCR specificity is different and other non-MHC resources are not limiting. Therefore, the numbers of self ligands expressed in the periphery set the limits on TCR diversity.,

    title: Two waves of recombinase gene expression in developing thymocytes,
    abstract: During T cell development in the thymus, T cell receptor (TCR) alpha, beta, gamma, and delta genes are rearranged and expressed. TCR rearrangement strictly depends upon the coordinate activity of two recombinase activating genes, Rag-1 and Rag-2. In this study we have followed the expression of these genes at different stages of intrathymic development. The results indicate that there are two periods of high Rag-1 and Rag-2 mRNA expression. The first wave peaks early at the CD25+CD4-CD8-CD3- stage of development and coincides with the initial appearance of transcripts derived from fully rearranged TCR beta, gamma, and delta genes, whereas the second wave occurs later at the CD4+CD8+ stage coincident with full-length TCR alpha mRNA expression. Active downregulation of Rag-1 and Rag-2 mRNA expression appears to occur in vivo between the two peaks of recombinase activity. This phenomenon can be mimicked in vitro in response to artificial stimuli such as phorbol myristate acetate and calcium ionophore. Collectively our data suggest that recombinase expression is actively regulated during early thymus development independently of cell surface expression of a mature heterodimeric TCR protein complex.,

    title: Activated Ras signals differentiation and expansion of CD4+8+ thymocytes.,
    abstract: We describe a novel approach to assay the ability of particular gene products to signal transitions in lymphocyte differentiation in vivo. The method involves transfection of test expression constructs into RAG-1-deficient embryonic stem cells, which are subsequently assayed by the RAG-2-deficient blastocyst complementation approach. We have used this method to demonstrate that expression of activated Ras in CD4-8- (double negative, DN) prothymocytes in vivo induces their differentiation into small CD4+8+ (double positive, DP) cortical thymocytes with accompanying expansion to normal thymocyte numbers. However, activated Ras expression in DP cells does not cause proliferation or maturation to CD4+8- or CD4-8+ (single positive) thymocytes. Therefore, signaling through Ras is sufficient for promoting differentiation of DN to DP cells, but further differentiation requires the activity of additional signaling pathways.,

    title: IL-2 receptor α chain (CD25JAC) expression defines a crucial stage in pre-B cell development,
    abstract: The analysis of the expression of the alpha chain of the IL-2 receptor (CD25, TAC) on the surface of B lineage cells in mouse bone marrow reveals that it is a useful marker to distinguish pre-B-I from pre-B-II cells. CD25 is not expressed on CD45R(B220)+ c-kit+ CD43+ TdT+ lambda 5+ c mu- sIg-IgH chain locus DJH-rearranged pre-B-I cells of mouse bone marrow. It is expressed on large cycling CD45R(B220)+ c-kit- CD43+ TdT- lambda 5+ c mu+ sIg- and on small resting CD45R(B220)+ c-kit- CD43- TdT- lambda 5- c mu- sIg- IgH chain locus VHDJH-rearranged pre-B-II cells. Therefore, the transition from pre-B-I to large pre-B-II cells is marked by the downregulation of c-kit and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT), and by the upregulation of CD25. SCID, RAG-2T, microMT and lambda 5T mutant mice do have normal, if not elevated numbers of pre-B-I cells but lack all CD25+ pre-B-II cells in their bone marrow. The expression of a transgenic H chain under control of the microH chain enhancer in RAG-2T bone marrow B lineage precursors allows the development of large and small CD25+ pre-B-II cells. The results suggest that the differentiation of pre-B-I to pre-B-II cells in mouse bone marrow requires the expression of microH chains and surrogate L chains in membranes, probably on the surface of precursor B cells.,

    title: Equine severe combined immunodeficiency: a defect in V(D)J recombination and DNA-dependent protein kinase activity.,
    abstract: V(D)J rearrangement is the molecular mechanism by which an almost infinite array of specific immune receptors are generated. Defects in this process result in profound immunodeficiency as is the case in the C.B-17 SCID mouse or in RAG-1 (recombination-activating gene 1) or RAG-2 deficient mice. It has recently become clear that the V(D)J recombinase most likely consists of both lymphoid-specific factors and ubiquitously expressed components of the DNA double-strand break repair pathway. The deficit in SCID mice is in a factor that is required for both of these pathways. In this report, we show that the factor defective in the autosomal recessive severe combined immunodeficiency of Arabian foals is required for (i) V(D)J recombination, (ii) resistance to ionizing radiation, and (iii) DNA-dependent protein kinase activity.,

    title: Lymphohematopoietic progenitors immortalized by a retroviral vector harboring a dominant-negative retinoic acid receptor can recapitulate lymphoid, myeloid, and erythroid development.,
    abstract: The lymphohematopoietic progenitors represent < 0.01% of nucleated marrow cells. Here, we describe the immortalization of the murine lymphohematopoietic progenitors by a retroviral vector harboring a dominant-negative retinoic acid receptor. The immortalized progenitors proliferate as a stem-cell-factor-dependent clonal line EML that spontaneously generates pre-pro-B lymphocytes and erythroid and myeloid progenitors. Upon stimulation with interleukin-7 and stromal cells, the pre-pro-B lymphocytes express RAG-1 and undergo D-J rearrangements of the immunoglobulin heavy-chain genes. With erythropoietin the erythroid progenitors proliferate and differentiate into red cells. Generation of the common progenitors for neutrophils and macrophages is suppressed in EML but is inducible by high concentrations of retinoic acid. An additional block in neutrophil differentiation occurs at the promyelocyte stage but can also be overcome by high concentrations of retinoic acid. These studies demonstrate a reproducible way to immortalize lymphohematopoietic progenitors and implicate specific roles for retinoic acid receptors at two distinct stages of hematopoiesis.,

    title: Robot-Assisted Gastrectomy With Lymph Node Dissection for Gastric Cancer: Lessons Learned From an Initial 100 Consecutive Procedures,
    abstract: Objective:To evaluate the technical feasibility, effectiveness, and safety of robot-assisted gastrectomy (RAG) with lymphadenectomy, using the da Vinci system through analyses of our initial series of 100 consecutive patients. Summary Background Data:The application of robotic surgery was proven to be one of the best cutting-edge technologies for successful minimally invasive surgery by providing solutions to the many drawbacks of laparoscopic surgery, yet few reports have studied robotic surgery in gastric cancer. Methods:A review of a prospectively designed database at our institute from July 2005 to October 2007 revealed a series of 100 consecutive RAG patients with a preoperative diagnosis of early gastric cancer. Clinicopathologic characteristics and surgical outcomes were analyzed. Results:All operations were performed successfully without open or laparoscopic conversion. There were 33 total gastrectomies and 67 subtotal gastrectomies with D1+&bgr; or extended lymphadenectomy (D2). The mean total operation time and console time were 231 and 150 minutes, respectively. There were 13 postoperative morbidities and 1 postoperative mortality. The first flatus was noted on postoperative day 2.9, soft diet was started on postoperative day 4.2, and the mean postoperative hospital stay was 7.8 days. Although all patients were diagnosed as early gastric cancer preoperatively, the final pathology report revealed that 19 patients exhibited a depth deeper than T2. The mean number of retrieved lymph nodes was 36.7 (range, 11–83). None of the specimens showed microscopic tumor involvement in the resection line. Conclusions:This study demonstrated that RAG with lymphadenectomy can be applied safely and effectively for patients with gastric cancer.,

    title: From Local to Global: A Graph RAG Approach to Query-Focused Summarization,
    abstract: The use of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to retrieve relevant information from an external knowledge source enables large language models (LLMs) to answer questions over private and/or previously unseen document collections. However, RAG fails on global questions directed at an entire text corpus, such as"What are the main themes in the dataset?", since this is inherently a query-focused summarization (QFS) task, rather than an explicit retrieval task. Prior QFS methods, meanwhile, fail to scale to the quantities of text indexed by typical RAG systems. To combine the strengths of these contrasting methods, we propose a Graph RAG approach to question answering over private text corpora that scales with both the generality of user questions and the quantity of source text to be indexed. Our approach uses an LLM to build a graph-based text index in two stages: first to derive an entity knowledge graph from the source documents, then to pregenerate community summaries for all groups of closely-related entities. Given a question, each community summary is used to generate a partial response, before all partial responses are again summarized in a final response to the user. For a class of global sensemaking questions over datasets in the 1 million token range, we show that Graph RAG leads to substantial improvements over a na\"ive RAG baseline for both the comprehensiveness and diversity of generated answers. An open-source, Python-based implementation of both global and local Graph RAG approaches is forthcoming at https://aka.ms/graphrag.,

    title: Different contributions of thymopoiesis and homeostasis-driven proliferation to the reconstitution of naive and memory T cell compartments,
    abstract: Following transfer into lymphopenic hosts, naive CD8 T cells proliferate and acquire memory phenotype. Although the acquired phenotype is stable in recombination activating gene-1-deficient (RAG−/−) recipients, in sublethally irradiated mice naive CD8 T cells of donor origin gradually accumulate. The naive cells have been attributed to phenotypic reversion of homeostatic memory cells, implying instability of memory phenotype and restoration of the naive T cell compartment by homeostasis-driven proliferation. We show here that (i) the accumulation of naive CD8 T cells of donor origin only occurs in recipients that have been irradiated and have an intact thymus; (ii) the apparent reversion of memory to naive cells actually results from de novo T cell development of hematopoietic stem cells, present in the donor spleen or lymph node cell populations, in the thymus of irradiated recipients; and (iii) the number of homeostatic memory cells generated in both RAG−/− and irradiated hosts reaches a plateau value and their phenotype is stably maintained even after retransfer into nonirradiated normal mice for 30 days. These findings demonstrate that homeostatic memory T cells do not revert to naive cells. After severe T cell depletion homeostasis-driven proliferation restores only the memory T cell compartment, whereas thymopoiesis is required for the reconstitution of the naive T cell compartment.,

    title: Safety-II in Practice: Developing the Resilience Potentials,
    abstract: Safety-I is defined as the freedom from unacceptable harm. The purpose of traditional safety management is therefore to find ways to ensure this ‘freedom’. But as socio-technical systems steadily have become larger and less tractable, this has become harder to do. Resilience engineering pointed out from the very beginning that resilient performance an organisation’s ability to function as required under expected and unexpected conditions alike – required more than the prevention of incidents and accidents. This developed into a new interpretation of safety (Safety-II) and consequently a new form of safety management. Safety-II changes safety management from protective safety and a focus on how things can go wrong, to productive safety and a focus on how things can and do go well. For Safety-II the aim is not just the elimination of hazards and the prevention of failures and malfunctions but also how best to develop an organisation’s potentials for resilient performance – the way it responds, monitors, learns, and anticipates. That requires models and methods that go beyond the Safety-I toolbox. This book introduces a comprehensive approach for the management of Safety-II, called the Resilience Assessment Grid (RAG). It explains the principles of the RAG and how it can be used to develop the resilience potentials. The RAG provides four interdependent sets of diagnostic and formative questions that can be tailored to any organisation. The questions are based on the principles of resilience engineering and backed by practical experience from several domains.,
