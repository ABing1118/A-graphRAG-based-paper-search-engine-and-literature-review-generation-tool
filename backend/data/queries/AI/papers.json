    "title": "Intelligent Clinical Documentation: Harnessing Generative AI for Patient-Centric Clinical Note Generation",
    "abstract": "Comprehensive clinical documentation is crucial for effective healthcare delivery, yet it poses a significant burden on healthcare professionals, leading to burnout, increased medical errors, and compromised patient safety. This paper explores the potential of generative AI (Artificial Intelligence) to streamline the clinical documentation process, specifically focusing on generating SOAP (Subjective, Objective, Assessment, Plan) and BIRP (Behavior, Intervention, Response, Plan) notes. We present a case study demonstrating the application of natural language processing (NLP) and automatic speech recognition (ASR) technologies to transcribe patient-clinician interactions, coupled with advanced prompting techniques to generate draft clinical notes using large language models (LLMs). The study highlights the benefits of this approach, including time savings, improved documentation quality, and enhanced patient-centered care. Additionally, we discuss ethical considerations, such as maintaining patient confidentiality and addressing model biases, underscoring the need for responsible deployment of generative AI in healthcare settings. The findings suggest that generative AI has the potential to revolutionize clinical documentation practices, alleviating administrative burdens and enabling healthcare professionals to focus more on direct patient care.",

    "title": "Yi: Open Foundation Models by 01.AI",
    "abstract": "We introduce the Yi model family, a series of language and multimodal models that demonstrate strong multi-dimensional capabilities. The Yi model family is based on 6B and 34B pretrained language models, then we extend them to chat models, 200K long context models, depth-upscaled models, and vision-language models. Our base models achieve strong performance on a wide range of benchmarks like MMLU, and our finetuned chat models deliver strong human preference rate on major evaluation platforms like AlpacaEval and Chatbot Arena. Building upon our scalable super-computing infrastructure and the classical transformer architecture, we attribute the performance of Yi models primarily to its data quality resulting from our data-engineering efforts. For pretraining, we construct 3.1 trillion tokens of English and Chinese corpora using a cascaded data deduplication and quality filtering pipeline. For finetuning, we polish a small scale (less than 10K) instruction dataset over multiple iterations such that every single instance has been verified directly by our machine learning engineers. For vision-language, we combine the chat language model with a vision transformer encoder and train the model to align visual representations to the semantic space of the language model. We further extend the context length to 200K through lightweight continual pretraining and demonstrate strong needle-in-a-haystack retrieval performance. We show that extending the depth of the pretrained checkpoint through continual pretraining further improves performance. We believe that given our current results, continuing to scale up model parameters using thoroughly optimized data will lead to even stronger frontier models.",

    "title": "TRIPOD+AI statement: updated guidance for reporting clinical prediction models that use regression or machine learning methods",
    "abstract": "The TRIPOD (Transparent Reporting of a multivariable prediction model for Individual Prognosis Or Diagnosis) statement was published in 2015 to provide the minimum reporting recommendations for studies developing or evaluating the performance of a prediction model. Methodological advances in the field of prediction have since included the widespread use of artificial intelligence (AI) powered by machine learning methods to develop prediction models. An update to the TRIPOD statement is thus needed. TRIPOD+AI provides harmonised guidance for reporting prediction model studies, irrespective of whether regression modelling or machine learning methods have been used. The new checklist supersedes the TRIPOD 2015 checklist, which should no longer be used. This article describes the development of TRIPOD+AI and presents the expanded 27 item checklist with more detailed explanation of each reporting recommendation, and the TRIPOD+AI for Abstracts checklist. TRIPOD+AI aims to promote the complete, accurate, and transparent reporting of studies that develop a prediction model or evaluate its performance. Complete reporting will facilitate study appraisal, model evaluation, and model implementation.",

    "title": "Constitutional AI: Harmlessness from AI Feedback",
    "abstract": "As AI systems become more capable, we would like to enlist their help to supervise other AIs. We experiment with methods for training a harmless AI assistant through self-improvement, without any human labels identifying harmful outputs. The only human oversight is provided through a list of rules or principles, and so we refer to the method as 'Constitutional AI'. The process involves both a supervised learning and a reinforcement learning phase. In the supervised phase we sample from an initial model, then generate self-critiques and revisions, and then finetune the original model on revised responses. In the RL phase, we sample from the finetuned model, use a model to evaluate which of the two samples is better, and then train a preference model from this dataset of AI preferences. We then train with RL using the preference model as the reward signal, i.e. we use 'RL from AI Feedback' (RLAIF). As a result we are able to train a harmless but non-evasive AI assistant that engages with harmful queries by explaining its objections to them. Both the SL and RL methods can leverage chain-of-thought style reasoning to improve the human-judged performance and transparency of AI decision making. These methods make it possible to control AI behavior more precisely and with far fewer human labels.",

    "title": "HuggingGPT: Solving AI Tasks with ChatGPT and its Friends in Hugging Face",
    "abstract": "Solving complicated AI tasks with different domains and modalities is a key step toward artificial general intelligence. While there are numerous AI models available for various domains and modalities, they cannot handle complicated AI tasks autonomously. Considering large language models (LLMs) have exhibited exceptional abilities in language understanding, generation, interaction, and reasoning, we advocate that LLMs could act as a controller to manage existing AI models to solve complicated AI tasks, with language serving as a generic interface to empower this. Based on this philosophy, we present HuggingGPT, an LLM-powered agent that leverages LLMs (e.g., ChatGPT) to connect various AI models in machine learning communities (e.g., Hugging Face) to solve AI tasks. Specifically, we use ChatGPT to conduct task planning when receiving a user request, select models according to their function descriptions available in Hugging Face, execute each subtask with the selected AI model, and summarize the response according to the execution results. By leveraging the strong language capability of ChatGPT and abundant AI models in Hugging Face, HuggingGPT can tackle a wide range of sophisticated AI tasks spanning different modalities and domains and achieve impressive results in language, vision, speech, and other challenging tasks, which paves a new way towards the realization of artificial general intelligence.",

    "abstract": "As healthcare systems around the world face challenges such as escalating costs, limited access, and growing demand for personalized care, artificial intelligence (AI) is emerging as a key force for transformation. This review is motivated by the urgent need to harness AI’s potential to mitigate these issues and aims to critically assess AI’s integration in different healthcare domains. We explore how AI empowers clinical decision-making, optimizes hospital operation and management, refines medical image analysis, and revolutionizes patient care and monitoring through AI-powered wearables. Through several case studies, we review how AI has transformed specific healthcare domains and discuss the remaining challenges and possible solutions. Additionally, we will discuss methodologies for assessing AI healthcare solutions, ethical challenges of AI deployment, and the importance of data privacy and bias mitigation for responsible technology use. By presenting a critical assessment of AI’s transformative potential, this review equips researchers with a deeper understanding of AI’s current and future impact on healthcare. It encourages an interdisciplinary dialogue between researchers, clinicians, and technologists to navigate the complexities of AI implementation, fostering the development of AI-driven solutions that prioritize ethical standards, equity, and a patient-centered approach.",

    "title": "Learning Deep Architectures for AI",
    "abstract": "Theoretical results strongly suggest that in order to learn the kind of complicated functions that can represent high-level abstractions (e.g. in vision, language, and other AI-level tasks), one needs deep architectures. Deep architectures are composed of multiple levels of non-linear operations, such as in neural nets with many hidden layers or in complicated propositional formulae re-using many sub-formulae. Searching the parameter space of deep architectures is a difficult optimization task, but learning algorithms such as those for Deep Belief Networks have recently been proposed to tackle this problem with notable success, beating the state-of-the-art in certain areas. This paper discusses the motivations and principles regarding learning algorithms for deep architectures, in particular those exploiting as building blocks unsupervised learning of single-layer models such as Restricted Boltzmann Machines, used to construct deeper models such as Deep Belief Networks.",

    "title": "Can AI-Generated Text be Reliably Detected?",
    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) perform impressively well in various applications. However, the potential for misuse of these models in activities such as plagiarism, generating fake news, and spamming has raised concern about their responsible use. Consequently, the reliable detection of AI-generated text has become a critical area of research. AI text detectors have shown to be effective under their specific settings. In this paper, we stress-test the robustness of these AI text detectors in the presence of an attacker. We introduce recursive paraphrasing attack to stress test a wide range of detection schemes, including the ones using the watermarking as well as neural network-based detectors, zero shot classifiers, and retrieval-based detectors. Our experiments conducted on passages, each approximately 300 tokens long, reveal the varying sensitivities of these detectors to our attacks. Our findings indicate that while our recursive paraphrasing method can significantly reduce detection rates, it only slightly degrades text quality in many cases, highlighting potential vulnerabilities in current detection systems in the presence of an attacker. Additionally, we investigate the susceptibility of watermarked LLMs to spoofing attacks aimed at misclassifying human-written text as AI-generated. We demonstrate that an attacker can infer hidden AI text signatures without white-box access to the detection method, potentially leading to reputational risks for LLM developers. Finally, we provide a theoretical framework connecting the AUROC of the best possible detector to the Total Variation distance between human and AI text distributions. This analysis offers insights into the fundamental challenges of reliable detection as language models continue to advance. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/vinusankars/Reliability-of-AI-text-detectors.",

    "abstract": "Pre-trained large language models (“LLMs”) like GPT-3 can engage in fluent, multi-turn instruction-taking out-of-the-box, making them attractive materials for designing natural language interactions. Using natural language to steer LLM outputs (“prompting”) has emerged as an important design technique potentially accessible to non-AI-experts. Crafting effective prompts can be challenging, however, and prompt-based interactions are brittle. Here, we explore whether non-AI-experts can successfully engage in “end-user prompt engineering” using a design probe—a prototype LLM-based chatbot design tool supporting development and systematic evaluation of prompting strategies. Ultimately, our probe participants explored prompt designs opportunistically, not systematically, and struggled in ways echoing end-user programming systems and interactive machine learning systems. Expectations stemming from human-to-human instructional experiences, and a tendency to overgeneralize, were barriers to effective prompt design. These findings have implications for non-AI-expert-facing LLM-based tool design and for improving LLM-and-prompt literacy among programmers and the public, and present opportunities for further research.",

    "title": "Engineering Education in the Era of ChatGPT: Promise and Pitfalls of Generative AI for Education",
    "abstract": "Engineering education is constantly evolving to keep up with the latest technological developments and meet the changing needs of the engineering industry. One promising development in this field is the use of generative artificial intelligence technology, such as the ChatGPT conversational agent. ChatGPT has the potential to offer personalized and effective learning experiences by providing students with customized feedback and explanations, as well as creating realistic virtual simulations for hands-on learning. However, it is important to also consider the limitations of this technology. ChatGPT and other generative AI systems are only as good as their training data and may perpetuate biases or even generate and spread misinformation. Additionally, the use of generative AI in education raises ethical concerns such as the potential for unethical or dishonest use by students and the potential unemployment of humans who are made redundant by technology. While the current state of generative AI technology represented by ChatGPT is impressive but flawed, it is only a preview of what is to come. It is important for engineering educators to understand the implications of this technology and study how to adapt the engineering education ecosystem to ensure that the next generation of engineers can take advantage of the benefits offered by generative AI while minimizing any negative consequences.",

    "title": "A Comprehensive Survey of AI-Generated Content (AIGC): A History of Generative AI from GAN to ChatGPT",
    "abstract": "Recently, ChatGPT, along with DALL-E-2 and Codex,has been gaining significant attention from society. As a result, many individuals have become interested in related resources and are seeking to uncover the background and secrets behind its impressive performance. In fact, ChatGPT and other Generative AI (GAI) techniques belong to the category of Artificial Intelligence Generated Content (AIGC), which involves the creation of digital content, such as images, music, and natural language, through AI models. The goal of AIGC is to make the content creation process more efficient and accessible, allowing for the production of high-quality content at a faster pace. AIGC is achieved by extracting and understanding intent information from instructions provided by human, and generating the content according to its knowledge and the intent information. In recent years, large-scale models have become increasingly important in AIGC as they provide better intent extraction and thus, improved generation results. With the growth of data and the size of the models, the distribution that the model can learn becomes more comprehensive and closer to reality, leading to more realistic and high-quality content generation. This survey provides a comprehensive review on the history of generative models, and basic components, recent advances in AIGC from unimodal interaction and multimodal interaction. From the perspective of unimodality, we introduce the generation tasks and relative models of text and image. From the perspective of multimodality, we introduce the cross-application between the modalities mentioned above. Finally, we discuss the existing open problems and future challenges in AIGC.",

    "title": "Shaping the Future of Education: Exploring the Potential and Consequences of AI and ChatGPT in Educational Settings",
    "abstract": "Over the last decade, technological advancements, especially artificial intelligence (AI), have significantly transformed educational practices. Recently, the development and adoption of Generative Pre-trained Transformers (GPT), particularly OpenAI’s ChatGPT, has sparked considerable interest. The unprecedented capabilities of these models, such as generating humanlike text and facilitating automated conversations, have broad implications in various sectors, including education and health. Despite their immense potential, concerns regarding their widespread use and opacity have been raised within the scientific community. ChatGPT, the latest version of the GPT series, has displayed remarkable proficiency, passed the US bar law exam, and amassed over a million subscribers shortly after its launch. However, its impact on the education sector has elicited mixed reactions, with some educators heralding it as a progressive step and others raising alarms over its potential to reduce analytical skills and promote misconduct. This paper aims to delve into these discussions, exploring the potential and problems associated with applying advanced AI models in education. It builds on extant literature and contributes to understanding how these technologies reshape educational norms in the “new AI gold rush” era.",

    "abstract": "Generative AI models have shown impressive performance on many Natural Language Processing tasks such as language understanding, reasoning, and language generation. An important question being asked by the AI community today is about the capabilities and limits of these models, and it is clear that evaluating generative AI is very challenging. Most studies on generative LLMs have been restricted to English and it is unclear how capable these models are at understanding and generating text in other languages. We present the first comprehensive benchmarking of generative LLMs - MEGA, which evaluates models on standard NLP benchmarks, covering 16 NLP datasets across 70 typologically diverse languages. We compare the performance of generative LLMs including Chat-GPT and GPT-4 to State of the Art (SOTA) non-autoregressive models on these tasks to determine how well generative models perform compared to the previous generation of LLMs. We present a thorough analysis of the performance of models across languages and tasks and discuss challenges in improving the performance of generative LLMs on low-resource languages. We create a framework for evaluating generative LLMs in the multilingual setting and provide directions for future progress in the field.",

Access to AI assistance increases worker productivity, as measured by issues resolved per hour, by 15\\% on average, with substantial heterogeneity across workers. Less experienced and lower-skilled workers improve both the speed and quality of their output while the most experienced and highest-skilled workers see small gains in speed and small declines in quality. We also find evidence that AI assistance facilitates worker learning and improves English fluency, particularly among international agents. While AI systems improve with more training data, we find that the gains from AI adoption are largest for relatively rare problems, where human agents have less baseline training and experience. Finally, we provide evidence that AI assistance improves the experience of work along two key dimensions: customers are more polite and less likely to ask to speak to a manager.",

    "title": "Regulating ChatGPT and other Large Generative AI Models",
    "abstract": "Large generative AI models (LGAIMs), such as ChatGPT, GPT-4 or Stable Diffusion, are rapidly transforming the way we communicate, illustrate, and create. However, AI regulation, in the EU and beyond, has primarily focused on conventional AI models, not LGAIMs. This paper will situate these new generative models in the current debate on trustworthy AI regulation, and ask how the law can be tailored to their capabilities. After laying technical foundations, the legal part of the paper proceeds in four steps, covering (1) direct regulation, (2) data protection, (3) content moderation, and (4) policy proposals. It suggests a novel terminology to capture the AI value chain in LGAIM settings by differentiating between LGAIM developers, deployers, professional and non-professional users, as well as recipients of LGAIM output. We tailor regulatory duties to these different actors along the value chain and suggest strategies to ensure that LGAIMs are trustworthy and deployed for the benefit of society at large. Rules in the AI Act and other direct regulation must match the specificities of pre-trained models. The paper argues for three layers of obligations concerning LGAIMs (minimum standards for all LGAIMs; high-risk obligations for high-risk use cases; collaborations along the AI value chain). In general, regulation should focus on concrete high-risk applications, and not the pre-trained model itself, and should include (i) obligations regarding transparency and (ii) risk management. Non-discrimination provisions (iii) may, however, apply to LGAIM developers. Lastly, (iv) the core of the DSA's content moderation rules should be expanded to cover LGAIMs. This includes notice and action mechanisms, and trusted flaggers.",

This study explores the potential benefits and challenges of using ChatGPT in education (or “educative AI”). Design/Approach/Methods This paper proposes a theoretical framework called “IDEE” for educative AI such as using ChatGPT and other generative AI in education, which includes identifying the desired outcomes, determining the appropriate level of automation, ensuring ethical considerations, and evaluating effectiveness. Findings The benefits of using ChatGPT in education or more generally, educative AI, include a more personalized and efficient learning experience for students as well as easier and faster feedback for teachers. However, challenges such as the untested effectiveness of the technology, limitations in the quality of data, and ethical and safety concerns must also be considered.

    "title": "Art and the science of generative AI",
    "abstract": "Understanding shifts in creative work will help guide AI’s impact on the media ecosystem The capabilities of a new class of tools, colloquially known as generative artificial intelligence (AI), is a topic of much debate. One prominent application thus far is the production of high-quality artistic media for visual arts, concept art, music, and literature, as well as video and animation. For example, diffusion models can synthesize high-quality images (1), and large language models (LLMs) can produce sensible-sounding and impressive prose and verse in a wide range of contexts (2). The generative capabilities of these tools are likely to fundamentally alter the creative processes by which creators formulate ideas and put them into production. As creativity is reimagined, so too may be many sectors of society. Understanding the impact of generative AI—and making policy decisions around it—requires new interdisciplinary scientific inquiry into culture, economics, law, algorithms, and the interaction of technology and creativity.",

    "title": "Towards Generalist Biomedical AI",
    "abstract": "Medicine is inherently multimodal, with rich data modalities spanning text, imaging, genomics, and more. Generalist biomedical artificial intelligence (AI) systems that flexibly encode, integrate, and interpret this data at scale can potentially enable impactful applications ranging from scientific discovery to care delivery. To enable the development of these models, we first curate MultiMedBench, a new multimodal biomedical benchmark. MultiMedBench encompasses 14 diverse tasks such as medical question answering, mammography and dermatology image interpretation, radiology report generation and summarization, and genomic variant calling. We then introduce Med-PaLM Multimodal (Med-PaLM M), our proof of concept for a generalist biomedical AI system. Med-PaLM M is a large multimodal generative model that flexibly encodes and interprets biomedical data including clinical language, imaging, and genomics with the same set of model weights. Med-PaLM M reaches performance competitive with or exceeding the state of the art on all MultiMedBench tasks, often surpassing specialist models by a wide margin. We also report examples of zero-shot generalization to novel medical concepts and tasks, positive transfer learning across tasks, and emergent zero-shot medical reasoning. To further probe the capabilities and limitations of Med-PaLM M, we conduct a radiologist evaluation of model-generated (and human) chest X-ray reports and observe encouraging performance across model scales. In a side-by-side ranking on 246 retrospective chest X-rays, clinicians express a pairwise preference for Med-PaLM M reports over those produced by radiologists in up to 40.50% of cases, suggesting potential clinical utility. While considerable work is needed to validate these models in real-world use cases, our results represent a milestone towards the development of generalist biomedical AI systems.",

    "abstract": "Large language models have abilities in creating high-volume human-like texts and can be used to generate persuasive misinformation. However, the risks remain under-explored. To address the gap, this work first examined characteristics of AI-generated misinformation (AI-misinfo) compared with human creations, and then evaluated the applicability of existing solutions. We compiled human-created COVID-19 misinformation and abstracted it into narrative prompts for a language model to output AI-misinfo. We found significant linguistic differences within human-AI pairs, and patterns of AI-misinfo in enhancing details, communicating uncertainties, drawing conclusions, and simulating personal tones. While existing models remained capable of classifying AI-misinfo, a significant performance drop compared to human-misinfo was observed. Results suggested that existing information assessment guidelines had questionable applicability, as AI-misinfo tended to meet criteria in evidence credibility, source transparency, and limitation acknowledgment. We discuss implications for practitioners, researchers, and journalists, as AI can create new challenges to the societal problem of misinformation.",

    "title": "Survey of Explainable AI Techniques in Healthcare",
    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) with deep learning models has been widely applied in numerous domains, including medical imaging and healthcare tasks. In the medical field, any judgment or decision is fraught with risk. A doctor will carefully judge whether a patient is sick before forming a reasonable explanation based on the patient’s symptoms and/or an examination. Therefore, to be a viable and accepted tool, AI needs to mimic human judgment and interpretation skills. Specifically, explainable AI (XAI) aims to explain the information behind the black-box model of deep learning that reveals how the decisions are made. This paper provides a survey of the most recent XAI techniques used in healthcare and related medical imaging applications. We summarize and categorize the XAI types, and highlight the algorithms used to increase interpretability in medical imaging topics. In addition, we focus on the challenging XAI problems in medical applications and provide guidelines to develop better interpretations of deep learning models using XAI concepts in medical image and text analysis. Furthermore, this survey provides future directions to guide developers and researchers for future prospective investigations on clinical topics, particularly on applications with medical imaging.",

    "title": "Navigating the Jagged Technological Frontier: Field Experimental Evidence of the Effects of AI on Knowledge Worker Productivity and Quality",
    "abstract": "The public release of Large Language Models (LLMs) has sparked tremendous interest in how humans will use Artificial Intelligence (AI) to accomplish a variety of tasks. In our study conducted with Boston Consulting Group, a global management consulting firm, we examine the performance implications of AI on realistic, complex, and knowledge-intensive tasks. The pre-registered experiment involved 758 consultants comprising about 7% of the individual contributor-level consultants at the company. After establishing a performance baseline on a similar task, subjects were randomly assigned to one of three conditions: no AI access, GPT-4 AI access, or GPT-4 AI access with a prompt engineering overview. We suggest that the capabilities of AI create a “jagged technological frontier” where some tasks are easily done by AI, while others, though seemingly similar in difficulty level, are outside the current capability of AI. For each one of a set of 18 realistic consulting tasks within the frontier of AI capabilities, consultants using AI were significantly more productive (they completed 12.2% more tasks on average, and completed tasks 25.1% more quickly), and produced significantly higher quality results (more than 40% higher quality compared to a control group). Consultants across the skills distribution benefited significantly from having AI augmentation, with those below the average performance threshold increasing by 43% and those above increasing by 17% compared to their own scores. For a task selected to be outside the frontier, however, consultants using AI were 19 percentage points less likely to produce correct solutions compared to those without AI. Further, our analysis shows the emergence of two distinctive patterns of successful AI use by humans along a spectrum of humanAI integration. One set of consultants acted as “Centaurs,” like the mythical halfhorse/half-human creature, dividing and delegating their solution-creation activities to the AI or to themselves. Another set of consultants acted more like “Cyborgs,” completely integrating their task flow with the AI and continually interacting with the technology.",

    "title": "Can AI Help in Screening Viral and COVID-19 Pneumonia?",
    "abstract": "Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a pandemic disease, which has already caused thousands of causalities and infected several millions of people worldwide. Any technological tool enabling rapid screening of the COVID-19 infection with high accuracy can be crucially helpful to the healthcare professionals. The main clinical tool currently in use for the diagnosis of COVID-19 is the Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), which is expensive, less-sensitive and requires specialized medical personnel. X-ray imaging is an easily accessible tool that can be an excellent alternative in the COVID-19 diagnosis. This research was taken to investigate the utility of artificial intelligence (AI) in the rapid and accurate detection of COVID-19 from chest X-ray images. The aim of this paper is to propose a robust technique for automatic detection of COVID-19 pneumonia from digital chest X-ray images applying pre-trained deep-learning algorithms while maximizing the detection accuracy. A public database was created by the authors combining several public databases and also by collecting images from recently published articles. The database contains a mixture of 423 COVID-19, 1485 viral pneumonia, and 1579 normal chest X-ray images. Transfer learning technique was used with the help of image augmentation to train and validate several pre-trained deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The networks were trained to classify two different schemes: i) normal and COVID-19 pneumonia; ii) normal, viral and COVID-19 pneumonia with and without image augmentation. The classification accuracy, precision, sensitivity, and specificity for both the schemes were 99.7%, 99.7%, 99.7% and 99.55% and 97.9%, 97.95%, 97.9%, and 98.8%, respectively. The high accuracy of this computer-aided diagnostic tool can significantly improve the speed and accuracy of COVID-19 diagnosis. This would be extremely useful in this pandemic where disease burden and need for preventive measures are at odds with available resources.",

    "abstract": "As Artificial Intelligence (AI) advances technologically, it will inevitably bring many changes to classroom practices. However, research on AI in education reflects a weak connection to pedagogical perspectives or instructional approaches, particularly in K-12 education. AI technologies may benefit motivated and advanced students. Understanding the teacher’s role of student motivation in mediating and supporting learning with AI technologies in the classroom is needed. This study used self-determination theory as the undergirding framework to investigate how teacher support moderates the effects of student expertise on needs satisfactions and intrinsic motivation to learn with AI technologies. This experimental study involved 123 Grade 10 students, and used chatbots as AI-based technologies in the experiment. The analyses revealed that intrinsic motivation and competence to learn with the chatbot depended on both teacher support and student expertise (i.e., self-regulated learning and digital literacy), and the teacher support better satisfied the need for relatedness, and it less satisfied the need for autonomy. The findings refined our understanding about the application of self-determination theory and expand the pedagogical and design considerations of AI application and instructional practices.",

    "title": "Connecting the Dots in Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence: From AI Principles, Ethics, and Key Requirements to Responsible AI Systems and Regulation",
    "abstract": "Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence (AI) is based on seven technical requirements sustained over three main pillars that should be met throughout the system's entire life cycle: it should be (1) lawful, (2) ethical, and (3) robust, both from a technical and a social perspective. However, attaining truly trustworthy AI concerns a wider vision that comprises the trustworthiness of all processes and actors that are part of the system's life cycle, and considers previous aspects from different lenses. A more holistic vision contemplates four essential axes: the global principles for ethical use and development of AI-based systems, a philosophical take on AI ethics, a risk-based approach to AI regulation, and the mentioned pillars and requirements. The seven requirements (human agency and oversight; robustness and safety; privacy and data governance; transparency; diversity, non-discrimination and fairness; societal and environmental wellbeing; and accountability) are analyzed from a triple perspective: What each requirement for trustworthy AI is, Why it is needed, and How each requirement can be implemented in practice. On the other hand, a practical approach to implement trustworthy AI systems allows defining the concept of responsibility of AI-based systems facing the law, through a given auditing process. Therefore, a responsible AI system is the resulting notion we introduce in this work, and a concept of utmost necessity that can be realized through auditing processes, subject to the challenges posed by the use of regulatory sandboxes. Our multidisciplinary vision of trustworthy AI culminates in a debate on the diverging views published lately about the future of AI. Our reflections in this matter conclude that regulation is a key for reaching a consensus among these views, and that trustworthy and responsible AI systems will be crucial for the present and future of our society.",

    "abstract": "We present Habitat, a platform for research in embodied artificial intelligence (AI). Habitat enables training embodied agents (virtual robots) in highly efficient photorealistic 3D simulation. Specifically, Habitat consists of: (i) Habitat-Sim: a flexible, high-performance 3D simulator with configurable agents, sensors, and generic 3D dataset handling. Habitat-Sim is fast -- when rendering a scene from Matterport3D, it achieves several thousand frames per second (fps) running single-threaded, and can reach over 10,000 fps multi-process on a single GPU. (ii) Habitat-API: a modular high-level library for end-to-end development of embodied AI algorithms -- defining tasks (e.g., navigation, instruction following, question answering), configuring, training, and benchmarking embodied agents. These large-scale engineering contributions enable us to answer scientific questions requiring experiments that were till now impracticable or 'merely' impractical. Specifically, in the context of point-goal navigation: (1) we revisit the comparison between learning and SLAM approaches from two recent works and find evidence for the opposite conclusion -- that learning outperforms SLAM if scaled to an order of magnitude more experience than previous investigations, and (2) we conduct the first cross-dataset generalization experiments {train, test} x {Matterport3D, Gibson} for multiple sensors {blind, RGB, RGBD, D} and find that only agents with depth (D) sensors generalize across datasets. We hope that our open-source platform and these findings will advance research in embodied AI.",

    "title": "Explainable AI: A Review of Machine Learning Interpretability Methods",
    "abstract": "Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) have led to its widespread industrial adoption, with machine learning systems demonstrating superhuman performance in a significant number of tasks. However, this surge in performance, has often been achieved through increased model complexity, turning such systems into “black box” approaches and causing uncertainty regarding the way they operate and, ultimately, the way that they come to decisions. This ambiguity has made it problematic for machine learning systems to be adopted in sensitive yet critical domains, where their value could be immense, such as healthcare. As a result, scientific interest in the field of Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI), a field that is concerned with the development of new methods that explain and interpret machine learning models, has been tremendously reignited over recent years. This study focuses on machine learning interpretability methods; more specifically, a literature review and taxonomy of these methods are presented, as well as links to their programming implementations, in the hope that this survey would serve as a reference point for both theorists and practitioners.",

    "abstract": "The recent upsurge of diversified mobile applications, especially those supported by Artificial Intelligence (AI), is spurring heated discussions on the future evolution of wireless communications. While 5G is being deployed around the world, efforts from industry and academia have started to look beyond 5G and conceptualize 6G. We envision 6G to undergo an unprecedented transformation that will make it substantially different from the previous generations of wireless cellular systems. In particular, 6G will go beyond mobile Internet and will be required to support ubiquitous AI services from the core to the end devices of the network. Meanwhile, AI will play a critical role in designing and optimizing 6G architectures, protocols, and operations. In this article, we discuss potential technologies for 6G to enable mobile AI applications, as well as AI-enabled methodologies for 6G network design and optimization. Key trends in the evolution to 6G will also be discussed.",

    "title": "“Everyone wants to do the model work, not the data work”: Data Cascades in High-Stakes AI",
    "abstract": "AI models are increasingly applied in high-stakes domains like health and conservation. Data quality carries an elevated significance in high-stakes AI due to its heightened downstream impact, impacting predictions like cancer detection, wildlife poaching, and loan allocations. Paradoxically, data is the most under-valued and de-glamorised aspect of AI. In this paper, we report on data practices in high-stakes AI, from interviews with 53 AI practitioners in India, East and West African countries, and USA. We define, identify, and present empirical evidence on Data Cascades—compounding events causing negative, downstream effects from data issues—triggered by conventional AI/ML practices that undervalue data quality. Data cascades are pervasive (92% prevalence), invisible, delayed, but often avoidable. We discuss HCI opportunities in designing and incentivizing data excellence as a first-class citizen of AI, resulting in safer and more robust systems for all.",

    "abstract": "AI alignment aims to make AI systems behave in line with human intentions and values. As AI systems grow more capable, so do risks from misalignment. To provide a comprehensive and up-to-date overview of the alignment field, in this survey, we delve into the core concepts, methodology, and practice of alignment. First, we identify four principles as the key objectives of AI alignment: Robustness, Interpretability, Controllability, and Ethicality (RICE). Guided by these four principles, we outline the landscape of current alignment research and decompose them into two key components: forward alignment and backward alignment. The former aims to make AI systems aligned via alignment training, while the latter aims to gain evidence about the systems' alignment and govern them appropriately to avoid exacerbating misalignment risks. On forward alignment, we discuss techniques for learning from feedback and learning under distribution shift. On backward alignment, we discuss assurance techniques and governance practices. We also release and continually update the website (www.alignmentsurvey.com) which features tutorials, collections of papers, blog posts, and other resources.",

    "abstract": "Generative artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a powerful technology with numerous applications in various domains. There is a need to identify the requirements and evaluation metrics for generative AI models designed for specific tasks. The purpose of the research aims to investigate the fundamental aspects of generative AI systems, including their requirements, models, input–output formats, and evaluation metrics. The study addresses key research questions and presents comprehensive insights to guide researchers, developers, and practitioners in the field. Firstly, the requirements necessary for implementing generative AI systems are examined and categorized into three distinct categories: hardware, software, and user experience. Furthermore, the study explores the different types of generative AI models described in the literature by presenting a taxonomy based on architectural characteristics, such as variational autoencoders (VAEs), generative adversarial networks (GANs), diffusion models, transformers, language models, normalizing flow models, and hybrid models. A comprehensive classification of input and output formats used in generative AI systems is also provided. Moreover, the research proposes a classification system based on output types and discusses commonly used evaluation metrics in generative AI. The findings contribute to advancements in the field, enabling researchers, developers, and practitioners to effectively implement and evaluate generative AI models for various applications. The significance of the research lies in understanding that generative AI system requirements are crucial for effective planning, design, and optimal performance. A taxonomy of models aids in selecting suitable options and driving advancements. Classifying input–output formats enables leveraging diverse formats for customized systems, while evaluation metrics establish standardized methods to assess model quality and performance.",

    "title": "A systematic review of Green AI",
    "abstract": "With the ever‐growing adoption of artificial intelligence (AI)‐based systems, the carbon footprint of AI is no longer negligible. AI researchers and practitioners are therefore urged to hold themselves accountable for the carbon emissions of the AI models they design and use. This led in recent years to the appearance of researches tackling AI environmental sustainability, a field referred to as Green AI. Despite the rapid growth of interest in the topic, a comprehensive overview of Green AI research is to date still missing. To address this gap, in this article, we present a systematic review of the Green AI literature. From the analysis of 98 primary studies, different patterns emerge. The topic experienced a considerable growth from 2020 onward. Most studies consider monitoring AI model footprint, tuning hyperparameters to improve model sustainability, or benchmarking models. A mix of position papers, observational studies, and solution papers are present. Most papers focus on the training phase, are algorithm‐agnostic or study neural networks, and use image data. Laboratory experiments are the most common research strategy. Reported Green AI energy savings go up to 115%, with savings over 50% being rather common. Industrial parties are involved in Green AI studies, albeit most target academic readers. Green AI tool provisioning is scarce. As a conclusion, the Green AI research field results to have reached a considerable level of maturity. Therefore, from this review emerges that the time is suitable to adopt other Green AI research strategies, and port the numerous promising academic results to industrial practice.",

    "title": "Concrete Problems in AI Safety",
    "abstract": "Rapid progress in machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) has brought increasing attention to the potential impacts of AI technologies on society. In this paper we discuss one such potential impact: the problem of accidents in machine learning systems, defined as unintended and harmful behavior that may emerge from poor design of real-world AI systems. We present a list of five practical research problems related to accident risk, categorized according to whether the problem originates from having the wrong objective function (\"avoiding side effects\" and \"avoiding reward hacking\"), an objective function that is too expensive to evaluate frequently (\"scalable supervision\"), or undesirable behavior during the learning process (\"safe exploration\" and \"distributional shift\"). We review previous work in these areas as well as suggesting research directions with a focus on relevance to cutting-edge AI systems. Finally, we consider the high-level question of how to think most productively about the safety of forward-looking applications of AI.",

    "title": "AI Art and its Impact on Artists",
    "abstract": "The last 3 years have resulted in machine learning (ML)-based image generators with the ability to output consistently higher quality images based on natural language prompts as inputs. As a result, many popular commercial “generative AI Art” products have entered the market, making generative AI an estimated $48B industry [125]. However, many professional artists have spoken up about the harms they have experienced due to the proliferation of large scale image generators trained on image/text pairs from the Internet. In this paper, we review some of these harms which include reputational damage, economic loss, plagiarism and copyright infringement. To guard against these issues while reaping the potential benefits of image generators, we provide recommendations such as regulation that forces organizations to disclose their training data, and tools that help artists prevent using their content as training data without their consent.",

    "abstract": "Correspondence to Dr Nash Anderson; nash. anderson@ gmail. com © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2023. Reuse permitted under CC BYNC. No commercial reuse. See rights and permissions. Published by BMJ. INTRODUCTION Researching a topic and generating an academic paper is a nuanced skill. It can take months or years to produce and publish one, if it is ever published at all. What if there were a way to make this happen instantly? Artificial intelligence (AI) may hold a flame to quickly analyse a research topic and generate an academic paper. There are many forms of AI; this editorial discusses natural language modelbased AI, such as ChatGPT, and their potential ability to generate academic papers. Natural language modelbased AI, in particular ChatGPT, is generating new content and a lot of controversies. This AI software is innovative. It generates, de novo, content that has a natural conversational flow. It can quickly answer questions and write poems, fan fiction and children’s books. ChatGPT has even passed the United States Medical Licensing Examination theory section with no additional training and/or years of studying medicine. Languagebased AI has already entered the scientific community. Nature reported that four manuscripts in preprint credit ChatGPT as an author. Also, an article reported that AI had been used to generate an academic paper. In this editorial, we discuss the pros and cons of AI for manuscript generation in sports and exercise medicine (SEM), generate an academic paper using AI and bypass AIgeneration detection, and discuss potential concerns regarding natural language modelbased AI. We aim to get insights on how AI, in particular ChatGPT and similar language modelbased AI, will impact the future of manuscript generation in SEM. To achieve such purpose, we ought to consider what is an academic paper, whether AI should write academic papers, what the issues are, what our stance should be on AIgenerated texts and how we deal with them.",

Metaverse seamlessly integrates the real world with the virtual world and allows avatars to carry out rich activities including creation, display, entertainment, social networking, and trading. Thus, it is promising to build an exciting digital world and to transform a better physical world through the exploration of the metaverse. In this survey, we dive into the metaverse by discussing how Blockchain and Artificial Intelligence (AI) fuse with it through investigating the state-of-the-art studies across the metaverse components, digital currencies, AI applications in the virtual world, and blockchain-empowered technologies. Further exploitation and interdisciplinary research on the fusion of AI and Blockchain towards metaverse will definitely require collaboration from both academia and industries. We wish that our survey can help researchers, engineers, and educators build an open, fair, and rational future metaverse.",

    "title": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) Assisted Biomedical Systems for Intelligent Healthcare",
    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) is a modern approach based on computer science that develops programs and algorithms to make devices intelligent and efficient for performing tasks that usually require skilled human intelligence. AI involves various subsets, including machine learning (ML), deep learning (DL), conventional neural networks, fuzzy logic, and speech recognition, with unique capabilities and functionalities that can improve the performances of modern medical sciences. Such intelligent systems simplify human intervention in clinical diagnosis, medical imaging, and decision-making ability. In the same era, the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) emerges as a next-generation bio-analytical tool that combines network-linked biomedical devices with a software application for advancing human health. In this review, we discuss the importance of AI in improving the capabilities of IoMT and point-of-care (POC) devices used in advanced healthcare sectors such as cardiac measurement, cancer diagnosis, and diabetes management. The role of AI in supporting advanced robotic surgeries developed for advanced biomedical applications is also discussed in this article.

    "title": "What is AI Literacy? Competencies and Design Considerations",
    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) is becoming increasingly integrated in user-facing technology, but public understanding of these technologies is often limited. There is a need for additional HCI research investigating a) what competencies users need in order to effectively interact with and critically evaluate AI and b) how to design learner-centered AI technologies that foster increased user understanding of AI. This paper takes a step towards realizing both of these goals by providing a concrete definition of AI literacy based on existing research. We synthesize a variety of interdisciplinary literature into a set of core competencies of AI literacy and suggest several design considerations to support AI developers and educators in creating learner-centered AI. These competencies and design considerations are organized in a conceptual framework thematically derived from the literature. This paper's contributions can be used to start a conversation about and guide future research on AI literacy within the HCI community.",

    "title": "Does the Whole Exceed its Parts? The Effect of AI Explanations on Complementary Team Performance",
    "abstract": "Many researchers motivate explainable AI with studies showing that human-AI team performance on decision-making tasks improves when the AI explains its recommendations. However, prior studies observed improvements from explanations only when the AI, alone, outperformed both the human and the best team. Can explanations help lead to complementary performance, where team accuracy is higher than either the human or the AI working solo? We conduct mixed-method user studies on three datasets, where an AI with accuracy comparable to humans helps participants solve a task (explaining itself in some conditions). While we observed complementary improvements from AI augmentation, they were not increased by explanations. Rather, explanations increased the chance that humans will accept the AI’s recommendation, regardless of its correctness. Our result poses new challenges for human-centered AI: Can we develop explanatory approaches that encourage appropriate trust in AI, and therefore help generate (or improve) complementary performance?",

    "abstract": "A surge of interest in explainable AI (XAI) has led to a vast collection of algorithmic work on the topic. While many recognize the necessity to incorporate explainability features in AI systems, how to address real-world user needs for understanding AI remains an open question. By interviewing 20 UX and design practitioners working on various AI products, we seek to identify gaps between the current XAI algorithmic work and practices to create explainable AI products. To do so, we develop an algorithm-informed XAI question bank in which user needs for explainability are represented as prototypical questions users might ask about the AI, and use it as a study probe. Our work contributes insights into the design space of XAI, informs efforts to support design practices in this space, and identifies opportunities for future XAI work. We also provide an extended XAI question bank and discuss how it can be used for creating user-centered XAI.",

    "abstract": "Advances in artificial intelligence (AI) frame opportunities and challenges for user interface design. Principles for human-AI interaction have been discussed in the human-computer interaction community for over two decades, but more study and innovation are needed in light of advances in AI and the growing uses of AI technologies in human-facing applications. We propose 18 generally applicable design guidelines for human-AI interaction. These guidelines are validated through multiple rounds of evaluation including a user study with 49 design practitioners who tested the guidelines against 20 popular AI-infused products. The results verify the relevance of the guidelines over a spectrum of interaction scenarios and reveal gaps in our knowledge, highlighting opportunities for further research. Based on the evaluations, we believe the set of design guidelines can serve as a resource to practitioners working on the design of applications and features that harness AI technologies, and to researchers interested in the further development of human-AI interaction design principles.",

    "title": "Effect of confidence and explanation on accuracy and trust calibration in AI-assisted decision making",
    "abstract": "Today, AI is being increasingly used to help human experts make decisions in high-stakes scenarios. In these scenarios, full automation is often undesirable, not only due to the significance of the outcome, but also because human experts can draw on their domain knowledge complementary to the model's to ensure task success. We refer to these scenarios as AI-assisted decision making, where the individual strengths of the human and the AI come together to optimize the joint decision outcome. A key to their success is to appropriately calibrate human trust in the AI on a case-by-case basis; knowing when to trust or distrust the AI allows the human expert to appropriately apply their knowledge, improving decision outcomes in cases where the model is likely to perform poorly. This research conducts a case study of AI-assisted decision making in which humans and AI have comparable performance alone, and explores whether features that reveal case-specific model information can calibrate trust and improve the joint performance of the human and AI. Specifically, we study the effect of showing confidence score and local explanation for a particular prediction. Through two human experiments, we show that confidence score can help calibrate people's trust in an AI model, but trust calibration alone is not sufficient to improve AI-assisted decision making, which may also depend on whether the human can bring in enough unique knowledge to complement the AI's errors. We also highlight the problems in using local explanation for AI-assisted decision making scenarios and invite the research community to explore new approaches to explainability for calibrating human trust in AI.",

    "title": "Opportunities and Adoption Challenges of AI in the Construction Industry: A PRISMA Review",
    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) is a powerful technology with a range of capabilities, which are beginning to become apparent in all industries nowadays. The increased popularity of AI in the construction industry, however, is rather limited in comparison to other industry sectors. Moreover, despite AI being a hot topic in built environment research, there are limited review studies that investigate the reasons for the low-level AI adoption in the construction industry. This study aims to reduce this gap by identifying the adoption challenges of AI, along with the opportunities offered, for the construction industry. To achieve the aim, the study adopts a systematic literature review approach using the PRISMA protocol. In addition, the systematic review of the literature focuses on the planning, design, and construction stages of the construction project lifecycle. The results of the review reveal that (a) AI is particularly beneficial in the planning stage as the success of construction projects depends on accurate events, risks, and cost forecasting; (b) the major opportunity in adopting AI is to reduce the time spent on repetitive tasks by using big data analytics and improving the work processes; and (c) the biggest challenge to incorporate AI on a construction site is the fragmented nature of the industry, which has resulted in issues of data acquisition and retention. The findings of the study inform a range of parties that operate in the construction industry concerning the opportunities and challenges of AI adaptability and help increase the market acceptance of AI practices.",

    "abstract": "We show how to assess a language model's knowledge of basic concepts of morality. We introduce the ETHICS dataset, a new benchmark that spans concepts in justice, well-being, duties, virtues, and commonsense morality. Models predict widespread moral judgments about diverse text scenarios. This requires connecting physical and social world knowledge to value judgements, a capability that may enable us to steer chatbot outputs or eventually regularize open-ended reinforcement learning agents. With the ETHICS dataset, we find that current language models have a promising but incomplete understanding of basic ethical knowledge. Our work shows that progress can be made on machine ethics today, and it provides a steppingstone toward AI that is aligned with human values.",

She states, \"I've argued that there is much at stake in how we define AI, what its boundaries are, and who determines them: it shapes what can be seen and contested\" (p. 217). *My own definition of AI goes something like this: I¬†imagine a future where I'm sitting in a cafe drinking coffee with my friends, but in this future, one of my friends is a robot, who like me is trying to make a living in this world. A future where humans and robots live in harmony. Crawford views this definition as mythological: \"These mythologies are particularly strong in the field of artificial intelligence, where the belief that human intelligence can be formalized and reproduced by machines has been axiomatic since the mid-twentieth century\" (p.¬†5). I do not know if my definition of artificial intelligence can come true, but I am enjoying the process of building, experimenting, and dreaming. *In her book, she asks me to consider that I may be unknowingly participating, as she states, in \"a material product of colonialism, with its patterns of extraction, conflict, and environmental destruction\" (p. 38). The book's subtitle illuminates the purpose of the book: specifically, the power, politics, and planetary costs of usurping artificial intelligence. Of course, this is not exactly Crawford's subtitle, and this is where I both agree and disagree with her. The book's subtitle is actually Power, Politics, and the Planetary Costs of Artificial Intelligence. In my opinion, AI is more the canary in the coal mine. We can use the canary to detect the poisonous gases, but we cannot blame the canary for the poisonous gas. It risks missing the point. Is AI itself to be feared? Should we no longer teach or learn AI? Or is this more about how we discern responsible use and direction for AI technology? *There is another author who speaks to similar issues. In Weapons of Math Destruction, Cathy O'Neil states it this way, \"If we had been clear-headed, we all would have taken a step back at this point to figure out how math had been misused ... But instead ... new mathematical techniques were hotter than ever ... A computer program could speed through thousands of resumes or loan applications in a second or two and sort them into neat lists, with the most promising candidates on top\" (p. 13). *Both Crawford and O'Neil point to human flaws that often lead to well-intentioned software developers creating code that results in unfair and discriminatory decisions. AI models encode unintended human biases that may not evaluate candidates as fairly as we would expect, yet there is a widespread notion that we can trust the algorithm. For example, the last time you registered an account on a website, did you click the checkbox confirming that \"yes, I read the disclaimer\" even though you did not? When we click \"yes\" we are accepting this disclaimer and placing trust in the software. Business owners place trust in software when they use it to make predictions. Engineers place trust in their algorithms when they write software without rigorous testing protocols. I¬†am just as guilty. *Crawford suggests that AI is often used in ways that are harmful. In the Atlas of AI we are given a tour of how technology is damaging our world: strip mining, labor injustice, the misuse of personal data, issues of state and power, to name a few of the concerns Crawford raises. The reality is that AI is built upon existing infrastructure. For example, Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, Amazon, TikTok have been collecting our information for profit even before AI became important to them. The data centers, CPU houses, and worldwide network infrastructure were already in place to meet consumer demand and geopolitics. But it is true that AI brings new technologies to the table, such as automated face recognition and decision tools to compare prospective employment applicants with diverse databases and employee monitoring tools that can make automatic recommendations. Governments, militaries, and intelligence agencies have taken notice. As invasion of privacy and social justice concerns emerge, Crawford calls us to consider these issues carefully. *Reading Crawford's words pricked my conscience, convicting me to reconsider my erroneous ways. For big tech to exist, to supply what we demand, it needs resources. She walks us through the many resources the technology industry needs to provide what we want, and AI is the \"new kid on the block.\" This book is not about AI, per se; it is instead about the side effects of poor business/research practices, opportunist behavior, power politics, and how these behaviors not only exploit our planet but also unjustly affect marginalized people. The AI industry is simply a new example of this reality: data mining, low wages to lower costs, foreign workers with fewer rights, strip mining, relying on coal and oil for electricity (although some tech companies have made strides to improve sustainability). This sounds more like a parable about the sins of the tech industry than a critique about the dangers of AI. *Could the machine learning community, like the inventors of dynamite who wanted to simply help railroads excavate tunnels, be unintentionally causing harm? Should we, as a community, be on the lookout for these potential harms? Do we have a moral responsibility? Maybe the technology sector needs to look more inwardly to ensure that process efficiency and cost savings are not elevated as most important. *I did not agree with everything that Crawford classified as AI, but I do agree that as a community we are responsible for our actions. If there are injustices, then this should be important to us. In particular, as people of faith, we should heed the call of Micah 6:8 to act justly in this world, and this includes how we use AI. *Reviewed by Joseph Vybihal, Professor of Computer Science, McGill University, Montreal, PQ H3A 0G4.",

    "title": "Green AI",
    "abstract": "The computations required for deep learning research have been doubling every few months, resulting in an estimated 300,000x increase from 2012 to 2018 [2]. These computations have a surprisingly large carbon footprint [38]. Ironically, deep learning was inspired by the human brain, which is remarkably energy efficient. Moreover, the financial cost of the computations can make it difficult for academics, students, and researchers, in particular those from emerging economies, to engage in deep learning research. This position paper advocates a practical solution by making efficiency an evaluation criterion for research alongside accuracy and related measures. In addition, we propose reporting the financial cost or\"price tag\"of developing, training, and running models to provide baselines for the investigation of increasingly efficient methods. Our goal is to make AI both greener and more inclusive---enabling any inspired undergraduate with a laptop to write high-quality research papers. Green AI is an emerging focus at the Allen Institute for AI.",

    "abstract": "The next generation of AI applications will continuously interact with the environment and learn from these interactions. These applications impose new and demanding systems requirements, both in terms of performance and flexibility. In this paper, we consider these requirements and present Ray---a distributed system to address them. Ray implements a dynamic task graph computation model that supports both the task-parallel and the actor programming models. To meet the performance requirements of AI applications, we propose an architecture that logically centralizes the system's control state using a sharded storage system and a novel bottom-up distributed scheduler. In our experiments, we demonstrate sub-millisecond remote task latencies and linear throughput scaling beyond 1.8 million tasks per second. We empirically validate that Ray speeds up challenging benchmarks and serves as both a natural and performant fit for an emerging class of reinforcement learning applications and algorithms.",

    "title": "AI Feynman: A physics-inspired method for symbolic regression",
    "abstract": "Our physics-inspired algorithm for symbolic regression is able to discover complex physics equations from mere tables of numbers. A core challenge for both physics and artificial intelligence (AI) is symbolic regression: finding a symbolic expression that matches data from an unknown function. Although this problem is likely to be NP-hard in principle, functions of practical interest often exhibit symmetries, separability, compositionality, and other simplifying properties. In this spirit, we develop a recursive multidimensional symbolic regression algorithm that combines neural network fitting with a suite of physics-inspired techniques. We apply it to 100 equations from the Feynman Lectures on Physics, and it discovers all of them, while previous publicly available software cracks only 71; for a more difficult physics-based test set, we improve the state-of-the-art success rate from 15 to 90%.",

    "title": "The Role of AI in Drug Discovery: Challenges, Opportunities, and Strategies",
    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to revolutionize the drug discovery process, offering improved efficiency, accuracy, and speed. However, the successful application of AI is dependent on the availability of high-quality data, the addressing of ethical concerns, and the recognition of the limitations of AI-based approaches. In this article, the benefits, challenges, and drawbacks of AI in this field are reviewed, and possible strategies and approaches for overcoming the present obstacles are proposed. The use of data augmentation, explainable AI, and the integration of AI with traditional experimental methods, as well as the potential advantages of AI in pharmaceutical research, are also discussed. Overall, this review highlights the potential of AI in drug discovery and provides insights into the challenges and opportunities for realizing its potential in this field. Note from the human authors: This article was created to test the ability of ChatGPT, a chatbot based on the GPT-3.5 language model, in terms of assisting human authors in writing review articles. The text generated by the AI following our instructions (see Supporting Information) was used as a starting point, and its ability to automatically generate content was evaluated. After conducting a thorough review, the human authors practically rewrote the manuscript, striving to maintain a balance between the original proposal and the scientific criteria. The advantages and limitations of using AI for this purpose are discussed in the last section.",

    "title": "Reporting guideline for the early stage clinical evaluation of decision support systems driven by artificial intelligence: DECIDE-AI",
    "abstract": "A growing number of artificial intelligence (AI)-based clinical decision support systems are showing promising performance in preclinical, in silico, evaluation, but few have yet demonstrated real benefit to patient care. Early stage clinical evaluation is important to assess an AI system’s actual clinical performance at small scale, ensure its safety, evaluate the human factors surrounding its use, and pave the way to further large scale trials. However, the reporting of these early studies remains inadequate. The present statement provides a multistakeholder, consensus-based reporting guideline for the Developmental and Exploratory Clinical Investigations of DEcision support systems driven by Artificial Intelligence (DECIDE-AI). We conducted a two round, modified Delphi process to collect and analyse expert opinion on the reporting of early clinical evaluation of AI systems. Experts were recruited from 20 predefined stakeholder categories. The final composition and wording of the guideline was determined at a virtual consensus meeting. The checklist and the Explanation & Elaboration (E&E) sections were refined based on feedback from a qualitative evaluation process. 123 experts participated in the first round of Delphi, 138 in the second, 16 in the consensus meeting, and 16 in the qualitative evaluation. The DECIDE-AI reporting guideline comprises 17 AI specific reporting items (made of 28 subitems) and 10 generic reporting items, with an E&E paragraph provided for each. Through consultation and consensus with a range of stakeholders, we have developed a guideline comprising key items that should be reported in early stage clinical studies of AI-based decision support systems in healthcare. By providing an actionable checklist of minimal reporting items, the DECIDE-AI guideline will facilitate the appraisal of these studies and replicability of their findings.",

    "title": "Democratising AI: Multiple Meanings, Goals, and Methods",
    "abstract": "Numerous parties are calling for “the democratisation of AI”, but the phrase is used to refer to a variety of goals, the pursuit of which sometimes conflict. This paper identifies four kinds of “AI democratisation” that are commonly discussed: (1) the democratisation of AI use, (2) the democratisation of AI development, (3) the democratisation of AI profits, and (4) the democratisation of AI governance. Numerous goals and methods of achieving each form of democratisation are discussed. The main takeaway from this paper is that AI democratisation is a multifarious and sometimes conflicting concept that should not be conflated with improving AI accessibility. If we want to move beyond ambiguous commitments to “democratising AI”, to productive discussions of concrete policies and trade-offs, then we need to recognise the principal role of the democratisation of AI governance in navigating tradeoffs and risks across decisions around use, development, and profits.",

    "abstract": "This study provided a content analysis of studies aiming to disclose how artificial intelligence (AI) has been applied to the education sector and explore the potential research trends and challenges of AI in education. A total of 100 papers including 63 empirical papers (74 studies) and 37 analytic papers were selected from the education and educational research category of Social Sciences Citation Index database from 2010 to 2020. The content analysis showed that the research questions could be classified into development layer (classification, matching, recommendation, and deep learning), application layer (feedback, reasoning, and adaptive learning), and integration layer (affection computing, role-playing, immersive learning, and gamification). Moreover, four research trends, including Internet of Things, swarm intelligence, deep learning, and neuroscience, as well as an assessment of AI in education, were suggested for further investigation. However, we also proposed the challenges in education may be caused by AI with regard to inappropriate use of AI techniques, changing roles of teachers and students, as well as social and ethical issues. The results provide insights into an overview of the AI used for education domain, which helps to strengthen the theoretical foundation of AI in education and provides a promising channel for educators and AI engineers to carry out further collaborative research.",

    "title": "In Search of Verifiability: Explanations Rarely Enable Complementary Performance in AI-Advised Decision Making",
    "abstract": "The current literature on AI‐advised decision making—involving explainable AI systems advising human decision makers—presents a series of inconclusive and confounding results. To synthesize these findings, we propose a simple theory that elucidates the frequent failure of AI explanations to engender appropriate reliance and complementary decision making performance. In contrast to other common desiderata, for example, interpretability or spelling out the AI's reasoning process, we argue that explanations are only useful to the extent that they allow a human decision maker to verify the correctness of the AI's prediction. Prior studies find in many decision making contexts that AI explanations do not facilitate such verification. Moreover, most tasks fundamentally do not allow easy verification, regardless of explanation method, limiting the potential benefit of any type of explanation. We also compare the objective of complementary performance with that of appropriate reliance, decomposing the latter into the notions of outcome‐graded and strategy‐graded reliance.",

In other words, how do we know that an explanainable AI system (XAI) is any good? Our focus is on the key concepts of measurement. We discuss specific methods for evaluating: (1) the goodness of explanations, (2) whether users are satisfied by explanations, (3) how well users understand the AI systems, (4) how curiosity motivates the search for explanations, (5) whether the user's trust and reliance on the AI are appropriate, and finally, (6) how the human-XAI work system performs.

    "title": "Expanding Explainability: Towards Social Transparency in AI systems",
    "abstract": "As AI-powered systems increasingly mediate consequential decision-making, their explainability is critical for end-users to take informed and accountable actions. Explanations in human-human interactions are socially-situated. AI systems are often socio-organizationally embedded. However, Explainable AI (XAI) approaches have been predominantly algorithm-centered. We take a developmental step towards socially-situated XAI by introducing and exploring Social Transparency (ST), a sociotechnically informed perspective that incorporates the socio-organizational context into explaining AI-mediated decision-making. To explore ST conceptually, we conducted interviews with 29 AI users and practitioners grounded in a speculative design scenario. We suggested constitutive design elements of ST and developed a conceptual framework to unpack ST’s effect and implications at the technical, decision-making, and organizational level. The framework showcases how ST can potentially calibrate trust in AI, improve decision-making, facilitate organizational collective actions, and cultivate holistic explainability. Our work contributes to the discourse of Human-Centered XAI by expanding the design space of XAI.",

    "abstract": "The rapid spread of artificial intelligence (AI) systems has precipitated a rise in ethical and human rights-based frameworks intended to guide the development and use of these technologies. Despite the proliferation of these \"AI principles,\" there has been little scholarly focus on understanding these efforts either individually or as contextualized within an expanding universe of principles with discernible trends.\r\n\r\nTo that end, this white paper and its associated data visualization compare the contents of thirty-six prominent AI principles documents side-by-side. This effort uncovered a growing consensus around eight key thematic trends: privacy, accountability, safety and security, transparency and explainability, fairness and non-discrimination, human control of technology, professional responsibility, and promotion of human values. Underlying this “normative core,” our analysis examined the forty-seven individual principles that make up the themes, detailing notable similarities and differences in interpretation found across the documents. In sharing these observations, it is our hope that policymakers, advocates, scholars, and others working to maximize the benefits and minimize the harms of AI will be better positioned to build on existing efforts and to push the fractured, global conversation on the future of AI toward consensus.",

We characterize the carbon footprint of AI computing by examining the model development cycle across industry-scale machine learning use cases and, at the same time, considering the life cycle of system hardware. Taking a step further, we capture the operational and manufacturing carbon footprint of AI computing and present an end-to-end analysis for what and how hardware-software design and at-scale optimization can help reduce the overall carbon footprint of AI. Based on the industry experience and lessons learned, we share the key challenges and chart out important development directions across the many dimensions of AI. We hope the key messages and insights presented in this paper can inspire the community to advance the field of AI in an environmentally-responsible manner.",

    "abstract": "From healthcare to criminal justice, artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly supporting high-consequence human decisions. This has spurred the field of explainable AI (XAI). This paper seeks to strengthen empirical application-specific investigations of XAI by exploring theoretical underpinnings of human decision making, drawing from the fields of philosophy and psychology. In this paper, we propose a conceptual framework for building human-centered, decision-theory-driven XAI based on an extensive review across these fields. Drawing on this framework, we identify pathways along which human cognitive patterns drives needs for building XAI and how XAI can mitigate common cognitive biases. We then put this framework into practice by designing and implementing an explainable clinical diagnostic tool for intensive care phenotyping and conducting a co-design exercise with clinicians. Thereafter, we draw insights into how this framework bridges algorithm-generated explanations and human decision-making theories. Finally, we discuss implications for XAI design and development.",

    "title": "HUMAN + MACHINE: REIMAGINING WORK IN THE AGE OF AI",
    "abstract": "Technology advances are making tech more...human. This changes everything you thought you knew about innovation and strategy. In their groundbreaking book Human + Machine, Accenture technology leaders Paul Daugherty and H. James Wilson showed how leading organizations use the power of humanmachine collaboration to transform their processes and their bottom lines. Now, as AI continues to rapidly impact both life and work, those companies and other pioneers across industries are tipping the balance even more strikingly toward the human with technology-led strategy that is reshaping the very nature of innovation. In Radically Human, Daugherty and Wilson show this profound shift, fast-forwarded by the pandemic, toward more human—and more humane—technology. Artificial intelligence is becoming less artificial and more intelligent. Instead of data-hungry approaches to AI, innovators are pursuing dataefficient approaches that enable machines to learn as humans do. Instead of replacing workers with machines, they are unleashing human expertise to create human-centered AI. In place of lumbering legacy IT systems, they are building cloud-first IT architectures able to continuously adapt to a world of billions of connected devices. And they are pursuing strategies that will take their place alongside classic winning business formulas like disruptive innovation. These against-the-grain approaches to the basic building blocks of business—Intelligence, Data, Experience, Architecture, and Strategy (IDEAS)—are transforming competition. Industrial giants and startups alike are drawing on this radically human IDEAS framework to create new business models, optimize postpandemic approaches to work and talent, rebuild trust with their stakeholders, and show the way toward a sustainable future. With compelling insights and fresh examples from a variety of industries, Radically Human will forever change the way you think about, practice, and win with innovation. Artificial intelligence threatens to disrupt the professions as it has manufacturing. Frank Pasquale argues that law and policy can avert this outcome and promote better ones: instead of replacing humans, technology can make our labor more valuable. Through regulation, we can ensure that AI promotes inclusive prosperity. Two statistics professors describe how intelligent machines are changing the world and use stories, rather than equations, to explain the mathematical language they use and provide a better grasp on concepts in data and probability. AI is radically transforming business. Are you ready? Look around you. Artificial intelligence is no longer just a futuristic notion. It's here right now--in software that senses what we need, supply chains that \"think\" in real time, and robots that respond to changes in their environment. Twenty-first-century pioneer companies are already using AI to innovate and grow fast. The bottom line is this: Businesses that understand how to harness AI can surge ahead. Those that",

    "abstract": "The rapid development of Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology has enabled the deployment of various systems based on it. However, many current AI systems are found vulnerable to imperceptible attacks, biased against underrepresented groups, lacking in user privacy protection. These shortcomings degrade user experience and erode people’s trust in all AI systems. In this review, we provide AI practitioners with a comprehensive guide for building trustworthy AI systems. We first introduce the theoretical framework of important aspects of AI trustworthiness, including robustness, generalization, explainability, transparency, reproducibility, fairness, privacy preservation, and accountability. To unify currently available but fragmented approaches toward trustworthy AI, we organize them in a systematic approach that considers the entire lifecycle of AI systems, ranging from data acquisition to model development, to system development and deployment, finally to continuous monitoring and governance. In this framework, we offer concrete action items for practitioners and societal stakeholders (e.g., researchers, engineers, and regulators) to improve AI trustworthiness. Finally, we identify key opportunities and challenges for the future development of trustworthy AI systems, where we identify the need for a paradigm shift toward comprehensively trustworthy AI systems.",

    "title": "Protocol for development of a reporting guideline (TRIPOD-AI) and risk of bias tool (PROBAST-AI) for diagnostic and prognostic prediction model studies based on artificial intelligence",
    "abstract": "Introduction The Transparent Reporting of a multivariable prediction model of Individual Prognosis Or Diagnosis (TRIPOD) statement and the Prediction model Risk Of Bias ASsessment Tool (PROBAST) were both published to improve the reporting and critical appraisal of prediction model studies for diagnosis and prognosis. This paper describes the processes and methods that will be used to develop an extension to the TRIPOD statement (TRIPOD-artificial intelligence, AI) and the PROBAST (PROBAST-AI) tool for prediction model studies that applied machine learning techniques. Methods and analysis TRIPOD-AI and PROBAST-AI will be developed following published guidance from the EQUATOR Network, and will comprise five stages. Stage 1 will comprise two systematic reviews (across all medical fields and specifically in oncology) to examine the quality of reporting in published machine-learning-based prediction model studies. In stage 2, we will consult a diverse group of key stakeholders using a Delphi process to identify items to be considered for inclusion in TRIPOD-AI and PROBAST-AI. Stage 3 will be virtual consensus meetings to consolidate and prioritise key items to be included in TRIPOD-AI and PROBAST-AI. Stage 4 will involve developing the TRIPOD-AI checklist and the PROBAST-AI tool, and writing the accompanying explanation and elaboration papers. In the final stage, stage 5, we will disseminate TRIPOD-AI and PROBAST-AI via journals, conferences, blogs, websites (including TRIPOD, PROBAST and EQUATOR Network) and social media. TRIPOD-AI will provide researchers working on prediction model studies based on machine learning with a reporting guideline that can help them report key details that readers need to evaluate the study quality and interpret its findings, potentially reducing research waste. We anticipate PROBAST-AI will help researchers, clinicians, systematic reviewers and policymakers critically appraise the design, conduct and analysis of machine learning based prediction model studies, with a robust standardised tool for bias evaluation. Ethics and dissemination Ethical approval has been granted by the Central University Research Ethics Committee, University of Oxford on 10-December-2020 (R73034/RE001). Findings from this study will be disseminated through peer-review publications. PROSPERO registration number CRD42019140361 and CRD42019161764.",

    "abstract": "The convergence of artificial intelligence (AI) and precision medicine promises to revolutionize health care. Precision medicine methods identify phenotypes of patients with less‐common responses to treatment or unique healthcare needs. AI leverages sophisticated computation and inference to generate insights, enables the system to reason and learn, and empowers clinician decision making through augmented intelligence. Recent literature suggests that translational research exploring this convergence will help solve the most difficult challenges facing precision medicine, especially those in which nongenomic and genomic determinants, combined with information from patient symptoms, clinical history, and lifestyles, will facilitate personalized diagnosis and prognostication.",

    "abstract": "The SPIRIT 2013 statement aims to improve the completeness of clinical trial protocol reporting by providing evidence-based recommendations for the minimum set of items to be addressed. This guidance has been instrumental in promoting transparent evaluation of new interventions. More recently, there has been a growing recognition that interventions involving artificial intelligence (AI) need to undergo rigorous, prospective evaluation to demonstrate their impact on health outcomes. The SPIRIT-AI (Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Interventional Trials–Artificial Intelligence) extension is a new reporting guideline for clinical trial protocols evaluating interventions with an AI component. It was developed in parallel with its companion statement for trial reports: CONSORT-AI (Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials–Artificial Intelligence). Both guidelines were developed through a staged consensus process involving literature review and expert consultation to generate 26 candidate items, which were consulted upon by an international multi-stakeholder group in a two-stage Delphi survey (103 stakeholders), agreed upon in a consensus meeting (31 stakeholders) and refined through a checklist pilot (34 participants). The SPIRIT-AI extension includes 15 new items that were considered sufficiently important for clinical trial protocols of AI interventions. These new items should be routinely reported in addition to the core SPIRIT 2013 items. SPIRIT-AI recommends that investigators provide clear descriptions of the AI intervention, including instructions and skills required for use, the setting in which the AI intervention will be integrated, considerations for the handling of input and output data, the human–AI interaction and analysis of error cases. SPIRIT-AI will help promote transparency and completeness for clinical trial protocols for AI interventions. Its use will assist editors and peer reviewers, as well as the general readership, to understand, interpret and critically appraise the design and risk of bias for a planned clinical trial. The CONSORT-AI and SPIRIT-AI extensions improve the transparency of clinical trial design and trial protocol reporting for artificial intelligence interventions.",

    "title": "Re-examining Whether, Why, and How Human-AI Interaction Is Uniquely Difficult to Design",
    "abstract": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) plays an increasingly important role in improving HCI and user experience. Yet many challenges persist in designing and innovating valuable human-AI interactions. For example, AI systems can make unpredictable errors, and these errors damage UX and even lead to undesired societal impact. However, HCI routinely grapples with complex technologies and mitigates their unintended consequences. What makes AI different? What makes human-AI interaction appear particularly difficult to design? This paper investigates these questions. We synthesize prior research, our own design and research experience, and our observations when teaching human-AI interaction. We identify two sources of AI's distinctive design challenges: 1) uncertainty surrounding AI's capabilities, 2) AI's output complexity, spanning from simple to adaptive complex. We identify four levels of AI systems. On each level, designers encounter a different subset of the design challenges. We demonstrate how these findings reveal new insights for designers, researchers, and design tool makers in productively addressing the challenges of human-AI interaction going forward.",

    "abstract": "This article develops a strategic framework for using artificial intelligence (AI) to engage customers for different service benefits. This framework lays out guidelines of how to use different AIs to engage customers based on considerations of nature of service task, service offering, service strategy, and service process. AI develops from mechanical, to thinking, and to feeling. As AI advances to a higher intelligence level, more human service employees and human intelligence (HI) at the intelligence levels lower than that level should be used less. Thus, at the current level of AI development, mechanical service should be performed mostly by mechanical AI, thinking service by both thinking AI and HI, and feeling service mostly by HI. Mechanical AI should be used for standardization when service is routine and transactional, for cost leadership, and mostly at the service delivery stage. Thinking AI should be used for personalization when service is data-rich and utilitarian, for quality leadership, and mostly at the service creation stage. Feeling AI should be used for relationalization when service is relational and high touch, for relationship leadership, and mostly at the service interaction stage. We illustrate various AI applications for the three major AI benefits, providing managerial guidelines for service providers to leverage the advantages of AI as well as future research implications for service researchers to investigate AI in service from modeling, consumer, and policy perspectives.",

    "title": "Are Explanations Helpful? A Comparative Study of the Effects of Explanations in AI-Assisted Decision-Making",
    "abstract": "This paper contributes to the growing literature in empirical evaluation of explainable AI (XAI) methods by presenting a comparison on the effects of a set of established XAI methods in AI-assisted decision making. Specifically, based on our review of previous literature, we highlight three desirable properties that ideal AI explanations should satisfy—improve people’s understanding of the AI model, help people recognize the model uncertainty, and support people’s calibrated trust in the model. Through randomized controlled experiments, we evaluate whether four types of common model-agnostic explainable AI methods satisfy these properties on two types of decision making tasks where people perceive themselves as having different levels of domain expertise in (i.e., recidivism prediction and forest cover prediction). Our results show that the effects of AI explanations are largely different on decision making tasks where people have varying levels of domain expertise in, and many AI explanations do not satisfy any of the desirable properties for tasks that people have little domain expertise in. Further, for decision making tasks that people are more knowledgeable, feature contribution explanation is shown to satisfy more desiderata of AI explanations, while the explanation that is considered to resemble how human explain decisions (i.e., counterfactual explanation) does not seem to improve calibrated trust. We conclude by discussing the implications of our study for improving the design of XAI methods to better support human decision making.",

    "title": "Co-Designing Checklists to Understand Organizational Challenges and Opportunities around Fairness in AI",
    "abstract": "Many organizations have published principles intended to guide the ethical development and deployment of AI systems; however, their abstract nature makes them difficult to operationalize. Some organizations have therefore produced AI ethics checklists, as well as checklists for more specific concepts, such as fairness, as applied to AI systems. But unless checklists are grounded in practitioners' needs, they may be misused. To understand the role of checklists in AI ethics, we conducted an iterative co-design process with 48 practitioners, focusing on fairness. We co-designed an AI fairness checklist and identified desiderata and concerns for AI fairness checklists in general. We found that AI fairness checklists could provide organizational infrastructure for formalizing ad-hoc processes and empowering individual advocates. We highlight aspects of organizational culture that may impact the efficacy of AI fairness checklists, and suggest future design directions.",

    "title": "Formalizing Trust in Artificial Intelligence: Prerequisites, Causes and Goals of Human Trust in AI",
    "abstract": "Trust is a central component of the interaction between people and AI, in that 'incorrect' levels of trust may cause misuse, abuse or disuse of the technology. But what, precisely, is the nature of trust in AI? What are the prerequisites and goals of the cognitive mechanism of trust, and how can we promote them, or assess whether they are being satisfied in a given interaction? This work aims to answer these questions. We discuss a model of trust inspired by, but not identical to, interpersonal trust (i.e., trust between people) as defined by sociologists. This model rests on two key properties: the vulnerability of the user; and the ability to anticipate the impact of the AI model's decisions. We incorporate a formalization of 'contractual trust', such that trust between a user and an AI model is trust that some implicit or explicit contract will hold, and a formalization of 'trustworthiness' (that detaches from the notion of trustworthiness in sociology), and with it concepts of 'warranted' and 'unwarranted' trust. We present the possible causes of warranted trust as intrinsic reasoning and extrinsic behavior, and discuss how to design trustworthy AI, how to evaluate whether trust has manifested, and whether it is warranted. Finally, we elucidate the connection between trust and XAI using our formalization.",

    "title": "Trust in AI and Its Role in the Acceptance of AI Technologies",
    "abstract": "Abstract As AI-enhanced technologies become common in a variety of domains, there is an increasing need to define and examine the trust that users have in such technologies. Given the progress in the development of AI, a correspondingly sophisticated understanding of trust in the technology is required. This paper addresses this need by explaining the role of trust in the intention to use AI technologies. Study 1 examined the role of trust in the use of AI voice assistants based on survey responses from college students. A path analysis confirmed that trust had a significant effect the on intention to use AI, which operated through perceived usefulness and participants’ attitude toward voice assistants. In Study 2, using data from a representative sample of the U.S. population, different dimensions of trust were examined using exploratory factor analysis, which yielded two dimensions: human-like trust and functionality trust. The results of the path analyses from Study 1 were replicated in Study 2, confirming the indirect effect of trust and the effects of perceived usefulness, ease of use, and attitude on intention to use. Further, both dimensions of trust shared a similar pattern of effects within the model, with functionality-related trust exhibiting a greater total impact on usage intention than human-like trust. Overall, the role of trust in the acceptance of AI technologies was significant across both studies. This research contributes to the advancement and application of the TAM in AI-related applications and offers a multidimensional measure of trust that can be utilized in the future study of trustworthy AI.",

    "title": "Queer In AI: A Case Study in Community-Led Participatory AI",
    "abstract": "Queerness and queer people face an uncertain future in the face of ever more widely deployed and invasive artificial intelligence (AI). These technologies have caused numerous harms to queer people, including privacy violations, censoring and downranking queer content, exposing queer people and spaces to harassment by making them hypervisible, deadnaming and outing queer people. More broadly, they have violated core tenets of queerness by classifying and controlling queer identities. In response to this, the queer community in AI has organized Queer in AI, a global, decentralized, volunteer-run grassroots organization that employs intersectional and community-led participatory design to build an inclusive and equitable AI future. In this paper, we present Queer in AI as a case study for community-led participatory design in AI. We examine how participatory design and intersectional tenets started and shaped this community’s programs over the years. We discuss different challenges that emerged in the process, look at ways this organization has fallen short of operationalizing participatory and intersectional principles, and then assess the organization’s impact. Queer in AI provides important lessons and insights for practitioners and theorists of participatory methods broadly through its rejection of hierarchy in favor of decentralization, success at building aid and programs by and for the queer community, and effort to change actors and institutions outside of the queer community. Finally, we theorize how communities like Queer in AI contribute to the participatory design in AI more broadly by fostering cultures of participation in AI, welcoming and empowering marginalized participants, critiquing poor or exploitative participatory practices, and bringing participation to institutions outside of individual research projects. Queer in AI’s work serves as a case study of grassroots activism and participatory methods within AI, demonstrating the potential of community-led participatory methods and intersectional praxis, while also providing challenges, case studies, and nuanced insights to researchers developing and using participatory methods.",

    "title": "A Survey on the Convergence of Edge Computing and AI for UAVs: Opportunities and Challenges",
    "abstract": "The latest 5G mobile networks have enabled many exciting Internet of Things (IoT) applications that employ unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs/drones). The success of most UAV-based IoT applications is heavily dependent on artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, for instance, computer vision and path planning. These AI methods must process data and provide decisions while ensuring low latency and low energy consumption. However, the existing cloud-based AI paradigm finds it difficult to meet these strict UAV requirements. Edge AI, which runs AI on-device or on edge servers close to users, can be suitable for improving UAV-based IoT services. This article provides a comprehensive analysis of the impact of edge AI on key UAV technical aspects (i.e., autonomous navigation, formation control, power management, security and privacy, computer vision, and communication) and applications (i.e., delivery systems, civil infrastructure inspection, precision agriculture, search and rescue (SAR) operations, acting as aerial wireless base stations (BSs), and drone light shows). As guidance for researchers and practitioners, this article also explores UAV-based edge AI implementation challenges, lessons learned, and future research directions.",

    "title": "Adoption of AI-based chatbots for hospitality and tourism",
    "abstract": "This study aims to investigate the customers’ behavioral intention and actual usage (AUE) of artificial intelligence (AI)-powered chatbots for hospitality and tourism in India by extending the technology adoption model (TAM) with context-specific variables.,To understand the customers’ behavioral intention and AUE of AI-powered chatbots for tourism, the mixed-method design was used whereby qualitative and quantitative techniques were combined. A total of 36 senior managers and executives from the travel agencies were interviewed and the analysis of interview data was done using NVivo 8.0 software. A total of 1,480 customers were surveyed and the partial least squares structural equation modeling technique was used for data analysis.,As per the results, the predictors of chatbot adoption intention (AIN) are perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness, perceived trust (PTR), perceived intelligence (PNT) and anthropomorphism (ANM). Technological anxiety (TXN) does not influence the chatbot AIN. Stickiness to traditional human travel agents negatively moderates the relation of AIN and AUE of chatbots in tourism and provides deeper insights into manager’s commitment to providing travel planning services using AI-based chatbots.,This research presents unique practical insights to the practitioners, managers and executives in the tourism industry, system designers and developers of AI-based chatbot technologies to understand the antecedents of chatbot adoption by travelers. TXN is a vital concern for the customers; so, designers and developers should ensure that chatbots are easily accessible, have a user-friendly interface, be more human-like and communicate in various native languages with the customers.,This study contributes theoretically by extending the TAM to provide better explanatory power with human–robot interaction context-specific constructs – PTR, PNT, ANM and TXN – to examine the customers’ chatbot AIN. This is the first step in the direction to empirically test and validate a theoretical model for chatbots’ adoption and usage, which is a disruptive technology in the hospitality and tourism sector in an emerging economy such as India.",

    "abstract": "The ubiquity of AI in society means the time is ripe to consider what educated 21st century digital citizens should know about this subject. In May 2018, the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AAAI) and the Computer Science Teachers Association (CSTA) formed a joint working group to develop national guidelines for teaching AI to K-12 students. Inspired by CSTA's national standards for K-12 computing education, the AI for K-12 guidelines will define what students in each grade band should know about artificial intelligence, machine learning, and robotics. The AI for K-12 working group is also creating an online resource directory where teachers can find AI- related videos, demos, software, and activity descriptions they can incorporate into their lesson plans. This blue sky talk invites the AI research community to reflect on the big ideas in AI that every K-12 student should know, and how we should communicate with the public about advances in AI and their future impact on society. It is a call to action for more AI researchers to become AI educators, creating resources that help teachers and students understand our work.",

    "title": "A Unified Framework of Five Principles for AI in Society",
    "abstract": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) is already having a major impact on society. As a result, many organizations have launched a wide range of initiatives to establish ethical principles for the adoption of socially beneficial AI. Unfortunately, the sheer volume of proposed principles threatens to overwhelm and confuse. How might this problem of ‘principle proliferation’ be solved? In this paper, we report the results of a fine-grained analysis of several of the highest-profile sets of ethical principles for AI. We assess whether these principles converge upon a set of agreed-upon principles, or diverge, with significant disagreement over what constitutes ‘ethical AI.’ Our analysis finds a high degree of overlap among the sets of principles we analyze. We then identify an overarching framework consisting of five core principles for ethical AI. Four of them are core principles commonly used in bioethics: beneficence, non-maleficence, autonomy, and justice. On the basis of our comparative analysis, we argue that a new principle is needed in addition: explicability, understood as incorporating both the epistemological sense of intelligibility (as an answer to the question ‘how does it work?’) and in the ethical sense of accountability (as an answer to the question: ‘who is responsible for the way it works?’). In the ensuing discussion, we note the limitations and assess the implications of this ethical framework for future efforts to create laws, rules, technical standards, and best practices for ethical AI in a wide range of contexts.KeywordsAccountability; Autonomy; Artificial Intelligence; Beneficence; Ethics; Explicability; Fairness; Intelligibility; Justice; Non-maleficence.",

    "title": "Influence of artificial intelligence (AI) on firm performance: the business value of AI-based transformation projects",
    "abstract": "PurposeThe main purpose of our study is to analyze the influence of Artificial Intelligence (AI) on firm performance, notably by building on the business value of AI-based transformation projects. This study was conducted using a four-step sequential approach: (1) analysis of AI and AI concepts/technologies; (2) in-depth exploration of case studies from a great number of industrial sectors; (3) data collection from the databases (websites) of AI-based solution providers; and (4) a review of AI literature to identify their impact on the performance of organizations while highlighting the business value of AI-enabled projects transformation within organizations.Design/methodology/approachThis study has called on the theory of IT capabilities to seize the influence of AI business value on firm performance (at the organizational and process levels). The research process (responding to the research question, making discussions, interpretations and comparisons, and formulating recommendations) was based on a review of 500 case studies from IBM, AWS, Cloudera, Nvidia, Conversica, Universal Robots websites, etc. Studying the influence of AI on the performance of organizations, and more specifically, of the business value of such organizations’ AI-enabled transformation projects, required us to make an archival data analysis following the three steps, namely the conceptual phase, the refinement and development phase, and the assessment phase.FindingsAI covers a wide range of technologies, including machine translation, chatbots and self-learning algorithms, all of which can allow individuals to better understand their environment and act accordingly. Organizations have been adopting AI technological innovations with a view to adapting to or disrupting their ecosystem while developing and optimizing their strategic and competitive advantages. AI fully expresses its potential through its ability to optimize existing processes and improve automation, information and transformation effects, but also to detect, predict and interact with humans. Thus, the results of our study have highlighted such AI benefits in organizations, and more specifically, its ability to improve on performance at both the organizational (financial, marketing and administrative) and process levels. By building on these AI attributes, organizations can, therefore, enhance the business value of their transformed projects. The same results also showed that organizations achieve performance through AI capabilities only when they use their features/technologies to reconfigure their processes.Research limitations/implicationsAI obviously influences the way businesses are done today. Therefore, practitioners and researchers need to consider AI as a valuable support or even a pilot for a new business model. For the purpose of our study, we adopted a research framework geared toward a more inclusive and comprehensive approach so as to better account for the intangible benefits of AI within organizations. In terms of interest, this study nurtures a scientific interest, which aims at proposing a model for analyzing the influence of AI on the performance of organizations, and at the same time, filling the associated gap in the literature. As for the managerial interest, our study aims to provide managers with elements to be reconfigured or added in order to take advantage of the full benefits of AI, and therefore improve organizations’ performance, the profitability of their investments in AI transformation projects, and some competitive advantage. This study also allows managers to consider AI not as a single technology but as a set/combination of several different configurations of IT in the various company’s business areas because multiple key elements must be brought together to ensure the success of AI: data, talent mix, domain knowledge, key decisions, external partnerships and scalable infrastructure.Originality/valueThis article analyses case studies on the reuse of secondary data from AI deployment reports in organizations. The transformation of projects based on the use of AI focuses mainly on business process innovations and indirectly on those occurring at the organizational level. Thus, 500 case studies are being examined to provide significant and tangible evidence about the business value of AI-based projects and the impact of AI on firm performance. More specifically, this article, through these case studies, exposes the influence of AI at both the organizational and process performance levels, while considering it not as a single technology but as a set/combination of the several different configurations of IT in various industries.",

    "title": "Do Users Write More Insecure Code with AI Assistants?",
    "abstract": "AI code assistants have emerged as powerful tools that can aid in the software development life-cycle and can improve developer productivity. Unfortunately, such assistants have also been found to produce insecure code in lab environments, raising significant concerns about their usage in practice. In this paper, we conduct a user study to examine how users interact with AI code assistants to solve a variety of security related tasks. Overall, we find that participants who had access to an AI assistant wrote significantly less secure code than those without access to an assistant. Participants with access to an AI assistant were also more likely to believe they wrote secure code, suggesting that such tools may lead users to be overconfident about security flaws in their code. To better inform the design of future AI-based code assistants, we release our user-study apparatus to researchers seeking to build on our work.",

    "title": "Teachers' trust in AI-powered educational technology and a professional development program to improve it",
    "abstract": "Evidence from various domains underlines the critical role that human factors, and especially trust, play in adopting technology by practitioners. In the case of Artificial Intelligence (AI) powered tools, the issue is even more complex due to practitioners' AI-specific misconceptions, myths and fears (e.g., mass unemployment and privacy violations). In recent years, AI has been incorporated increasingly into K-12 education. However, little research has been conducted on the trust and attitudes of K-12 teachers towards the use and adoption of AI-powered Educational Technology (AI-EdTech). This paper sheds light on teachers' trust in AI-EdTech and presents effective professional development strategies to increase teachers' trust and willingness to apply AI-EdTech in their classrooms. Our experiments with K-12 science teachers were conducted around their interactions with a specific AI-powered assessment tool (termed AI-Grader) using both synthetic and real data. The results indicate that presenting teachers with some explanations of (i) how AI makes decisions, particularly compared to the human experts, and (ii) how AI can",

    "title": "The Fallacy of AI Functionality",
    "abstract": "Deployed AI systems often do not work. They can be constructed haphazardly, deployed indiscriminately, and promoted deceptively. However, despite this reality, scholars, the press, and policymakers pay too little attention to functionality. This leads to technical and policy solutions focused on “ethical” or value-aligned deployments, often skipping over the prior question of whether a given system functions, or provides any benefits at all. To describe the harms of various types of functionality failures, we analyze a set of case studies to create a taxonomy of known AI functionality issues. We then point to policy and organizational responses that are often overlooked and become more readily available once functionality is drawn into focus. We argue that functionality is a meaningful AI policy challenge, operating as a necessary first step towards protecting affected communities from algorithmic harm.",

Blockchain technology has the ability to automate payment in cryptocurrency and to provide access to a shared ledger of data, transactions, and logs in a decentralized, secure, and trusted manner. Also with smart contracts, blockchain has the ability to govern interactions among participants with no intermediary or a trusted third party. AI, on the other hand, offers intelligence and decision-making capabilities for machines similar to humans. In this paper, we present a detailed survey on blockchain applications for AI. We review the literature, tabulate, and summarize the emerging blockchain applications, platforms, and protocols specifically targeting AI area.

    "title": "Human heuristics for AI-generated language are flawed",
    "abstract": "Significance Human communication is now rife with language generated by AI. Every day, across the web, chat, email, and social media, AI systems produce billions of messages that could be perceived as created by humans. In this work, we analyze human judgments of self-presentations written by humans and generated by AI systems. We find that people cannot detect AI-generated self-presentations as their judgment is misguided by intuitive but flawed heuristics for AI-generated language. We demonstrate that AI systems can exploit these heuristics to produce text perceived as “more human than human.” Our results raise the question of how humanity will adapt to AI-generated text, illustrating the need to reorient the development of AI language systems to ensure that they support rather than undermine human cognition.",

    "abstract": "We introduce Fairlearn, an open source toolkit that empowers data scientists and developers to assess and improve the fairness of their AI systems. Fairlearn has two components: an interactive visualization dashboard and unfairness mitigation algorithms. These components are designed to help with navigating trade-offs between fairness and model performance. We emphasize that prioritizing fairness in AI systems is a sociotechnical challenge. Because there are many complex sources of unfairness—some societal and some technical—it is not possible to fully “debias” a system or to guarantee fairness; the goal is to mitigate fairness-related harms as much as possible. As Fairlearn grows to include additional fairness metrics, unfairness mitigation algorithms, and visualization capabilities, we hope that it will be shaped by a diverse community of stakeholders, ranging from data scientists, developers, and business decision makers to the people whose lives may be affected by the predictions of AI systems.",

    "title": "Explaining Explanations in AI",
    "abstract": "Recent work on interpretability in machine learning and AI has focused on the building of simplified models that approximate the true criteria used to make decisions. These models are a useful pedagogical device for teaching trained professionals how to predict what decisions will be made by the complex system, and most importantly how the system might break. However, when considering any such model it's important to remember Box's maxim that \"All models are wrong but some are useful.\" We focus on the distinction between these models and explanations in philosophy and sociology. These models can be understood as a \"do it yourself kit\" for explanations, allowing a practitioner to directly answer \"what if questions\" or generate contrastive explanations without external assistance. Although a valuable ability, giving these models as explanations appears more difficult than necessary, and other forms of explanation may not have the same trade-offs. We contrast the different schools of thought on what makes an explanation, and suggest that machine learning might benefit from viewing the problem more broadly.",

    "title": "Superhuman AI for heads-up no-limit poker: Libratus beats top professionals",
    "abstract": "Libratus versus humans Pitting artificial intelligence (AI) against top human players demonstrates just how far AI has come. Brown and Sandholm built a poker-playing AI called Libratus that decisively beat four leading human professionals in the two-player variant of poker called heads-up no-limit Texas hold'em (HUNL). Over nearly 3 weeks, Libratus played 120,000 hands of HUNL against the human professionals, using a three-pronged approach that included precomputing an overall strategy, adapting the strategy to actual gameplay, and learning from its opponent. Science, this issue p. 418 An artificial intelligence program called Libratus played 120,000 hands of a two-player variant of poker and beat four leading human professionals. No-limit Texas hold’em is the most popular form of poker. Despite artificial intelligence (AI) successes in perfect-information games, the private information and massive game tree have made no-limit poker difficult to tackle. We present Libratus, an AI that, in a 120,000-hand competition, defeated four top human specialist professionals in heads-up no-limit Texas hold’em, the leading benchmark and long-standing challenge problem in imperfect-information game solving. Our game-theoretic approach features application-independent techniques: an algorithm for computing a blueprint for the overall strategy, an algorithm that fleshes out the details of the strategy for subgames that are reached during play, and a self-improver algorithm that fixes potential weaknesses that opponents have identified in the blueprint strategy.",

This article provides an integrated review of two facets of AI and art: (1) AI is used for art analysis and employed on digitized artwork collections, or (2) AI is used for creative purposes and generating novel artworks. In the context of AI-related research for art understanding, we present a comprehensive overview of artwork datasets and recent works that address a variety of tasks such as classification, object detection, similarity retrieval, multimodal representations, and computational aesthetics, among others. In relation to the role of AI in creating art, we address various practical and theoretical aspects of AI Art and consolidate related works that deal with those topics in detail. Finally, we provide a concise outlook on the future progression and potential impact of AI technologies on our understanding and creation of art.",

Going forth, reconciling such tensions between machine agency and human agency will be important in the era of artificial intelligence (AI), as machines get more agentic and media experiences become increasingly determined by algorithms. Theory and research should be geared toward a deeper understanding of the human experience of algorithms in general and the psychology of Human–AI interaction (HAII) in particular.

    "abstract": "Recently, along with the rapid development of mobile communication technology, edge computing theory and techniques have been attracting more and more attention from global researchers and engineers, which can significantly bridge the capacity of cloud and requirement of devices by the network edges, and thus can accelerate content delivery and improve the quality of mobile services. In order to bring more intelligence to edge systems, compared to traditional optimization methodology, and driven by the current deep learning techniques, we propose to integrate the Deep Reinforcement Learning techniques and Federated Learning framework with mobile edge systems, for optimizing mobile edge computing, caching and communication. And thus, we design the \"In-Edge AI\" framework in order to intelligently utilize the collaboration among devices and edge nodes to exchange the learning parameters for a better training and inference of the models, and thus to carry out dynamic system-level optimization and application-level enhancement while reducing the unnecessary system communication load. \"In-Edge AI\" is evaluated and proved to have near-optimal performance but relatively low overhead of learning, while the system is cognitive and adaptive to mobile communication systems.

This promise has led to growing focus and investment in AI medical applications both from governmental organizations and technological companies. However, concern has been expressed about the ethical and regulatory aspects of the application of AI in health care. These concerns include the possibility of biases, lack of transparency with certain AI algorithms, privacy concerns with the data used for training AI models, and safety and liability issues with AI application in clinical environments. While there has been extensive discussion about the ethics of AI in health care, there has been little dialogue or recommendations as to how to practically address these concerns in health care. In this article, we propose a governance model that aims to not only address the ethical and regulatory issues that arise out of the application of AI in health care, but also stimulate further discussion about governance of AI in health care.",

    "title": "Thinking responsibly about responsible AI and ‘the dark side’ of AI",
    "abstract": "ABSTRACT Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been argued to offer a myriad of improvements in how we work and live. The notion of AI comprises a wide-ranging set of technologies that allow individuals and organizations to integrate and analyze data and use that insight to improve or automate decision-making. While most attention has been placed on the positive aspects companies realize by the adoption by the adoption and use of AI, there is a growing concern around the negative and unintended consequences of such technologies. In this special issue we have made a call for research papers that help us explore the dark side of AI use. By adopting a dark side lens, we aimed to expand our understanding of how AI should be implemented in practice, and how to minimize or avoid negative outcomes. In this editorial, we build on the notion of responsible AI, to highlight the different ways in which AI can potentially produce unintended consequences, as well as to suggest alternative paths future IS research can follow to improve our knowledge about how to mitigate such occurrences. We further expand on dark side theorizing in order to uncover hidden assumptions of current literature as well as to propose other prominent themes that can guide future IS research on AI adoption and use.",

    "title": "Explanations Can Reduce Overreliance on AI Systems During Decision-Making",
    "abstract": "Prior work has identified a resilient phenomenon that threatens the performance of human-AI decision-making teams: overreliance, when people agree with an AI, even when it is incorrect. Surprisingly, overreliance does not reduce when the AI produces explanations for its predictions, compared to only providing predictions. Some have argued that overreliance results from cognitive biases or uncalibrated trust, attributing overreliance to an inevitability of human cognition. By contrast, our paper argues that people strategically choose whether or not to engage with an AI explanation, demonstrating empirically that there are scenarios where AI explanations reduce overreliance. To achieve this, we formalize this strategic choice in a cost-benefit framework, where the costs and benefits of engaging with the task are weighed against the costs and benefits of relying on the AI. We manipulate the costs and benefits in a maze task, where participants collaborate with a simulated AI to find the exit of a maze. Through 5 studies (N = 731), we find that costs such as task difficulty (Study 1), explanation difficulty (Study 2, 3), and benefits such as monetary compensation (Study 4) affect overreliance. Finally, Study 5 adapts the Cognitive Effort Discounting paradigm to quantify the utility of different explanations, providing further support for our framework. Our results suggest that some of the null effects found in literature could be due in part to the explanation not sufficiently reducing the costs of verifying the AI's prediction.",

    "title": "\"Hello AI\": Uncovering the Onboarding Needs of Medical Practitioners for Human-AI Collaborative Decision-Making",
    "abstract": "Although rapid advances in machine learning have made it increasingly applicable to expert decision-making, the delivery of accurate algorithmic predictions alone is insufficient for effective human-AI collaboration. In this work, we investigate the key types of information medical experts desire when they are first introduced to a diagnostic AI assistant. In a qualitative lab study, we interviewed 21 pathologists before, during, and after being presented deep neural network (DNN) predictions for prostate cancer diagnosis, to learn the types of information that they desired about the AI assistant. Our findings reveal that, far beyond understanding the local, case-specific reasoning behind any model decision, clinicians desired upfront information about basic, global properties of the model, such as its known strengths and limitations, its subjective point-of-view, and its overall design objective--what it's designed to be optimized for. Participants compared these information needs to the collaborative mental models they develop of their medical colleagues when seeking a second opinion: the medical perspectives and standards that those colleagues embody, and the compatibility of those perspectives with their own diagnostic patterns. These findings broaden and enrich discussions surrounding AI transparency for collaborative decision-making, providing a richer understanding of what experts find important in their introduction to AI assistants before integrating them into routine practice.",

    "title": "Acceptability of artificial intelligence (AI)-led chatbot services in healthcare: A mixed-methods study",
    "abstract": "Background Artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly being used in healthcare. Here, AI-based chatbot systems can act as automated conversational agents, capable of promoting health, providing education, and potentially prompting behaviour change. Exploring the motivation to use health chatbots is required to predict uptake; however, few studies to date have explored their acceptability. This research aimed to explore participants’ willingness to engage with AI-led health chatbots. Methods The study incorporated semi-structured interviews (N-29) which informed the development of an online survey (N-216) advertised via social media. Interviews were recorded, transcribed verbatim and analysed thematically. A survey of 24 items explored demographic and attitudinal variables, including acceptability and perceived utility. The quantitative data were analysed using binary regressions with a single categorical predictor. Results Three broad themes: ‘Understanding of chatbots’, ‘AI hesitancy’ and ‘Motivations for health chatbots’ were identified, outlining concerns about accuracy, cyber-security, and the inability of AI-led services to empathise. The survey showed moderate acceptability (67%), correlated negatively with perceived poorer IT skills OR = 0.32 [CI95%:0.13–0.78] and dislike for talking to computers OR = 0.77 [CI95%:0.60–0.99] as well as positively correlated with perceived utility OR = 5.10 [CI95%:3.08–8.43], positive attitude OR = 2.71 [CI95%:1.77–4.16] and perceived trustworthiness OR = 1.92 [CI95%:1.13–3.25]. Conclusion Most internet users would be receptive to using health chatbots, although hesitancy regarding this technology is likely to compromise engagement. Intervention designers focusing on AI-led health chatbots need to employ user-centred and theory-based approaches addressing patients’ concerns and optimising user experience in order to achieve the best uptake and utilisation. Patients’ perspectives, motivation and capabilities need to be taken into account when developing and assessing the effectiveness of health chatbots.",

    "title": "One Explanation Does Not Fit All: A Toolkit and Taxonomy of AI Explainability Techniques",
    "abstract": "As artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms make further inroads into society, calls are increasing from multiple stakeholders for these algorithms to explain their outputs. At the same time, these stakeholders, whether they be affected citizens, government regulators, domain experts, or system developers, present different requirements for explanations. Toward addressing these needs, we introduce AI Explainability 360 (this http URL), an open-source software toolkit featuring eight diverse and state-of-the-art explainability methods and two evaluation metrics. Equally important, we provide a taxonomy to help entities requiring explanations to navigate the space of explanation methods, not only those in the toolkit but also in the broader literature on explainability. For data scientists and other users of the toolkit, we have implemented an extensible software architecture that organizes methods according to their place in the AI modeling pipeline. We also discuss enhancements to bring research innovations closer to consumers of explanations, ranging from simplified, more accessible versions of algorithms, to tutorials and an interactive web demo to introduce AI explainability to different audiences and application domains. Together, our toolkit and taxonomy can help identify gaps where more explainability methods are needed and provide a platform to incorporate them as they are developed.",

    "title": "Communication-Efficient Edge AI: Algorithms and Systems",
    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) has achieved remarkable breakthroughs in a wide range of fields, ranging from speech processing, image classification to drug discovery. This is driven by the explosive growth of data, advances in machine learning (especially deep learning), and the easy access to powerful computing resources. Particularly, the wide scale deployment of edge devices (e.g., IoT devices) generates an unprecedented scale of data, which provides the opportunity to derive accurate models and develop various intelligent applications at the network edge. However, such enormous data cannot all be sent to the cloud for processing, due to the varying channel quality, traffic congestion and/or privacy concerns, and the enormous energy consumption. By pushing inference and training processes of AI models to edge nodes, edge AI has emerged as a promising alternative. AI at the edge requires close cooperation among edge devices, such as smart phones and smart vehicles, and edge servers at the wireless access points and base stations, which however result in heavy communication overheads. In this paper, we present a comprehensive survey of the recent developments in various techniques for overcoming these communication challenges. Specifically, we first identify key communication challenges in edge AI systems. We then introduce communication-efficient techniques, from both algorithmic and system perspectives for training and inference tasks at the network edge. Potential future research directions are also highlighted.",

    "abstract": "With the recent wave of progress in artificial intelligence (AI) has come a growing awareness of the large-scale impacts of AI systems, and recognition that existing regulations and norms in industry and academia are insufficient to ensure responsible AI development. In order for AI developers to earn trust from system users, customers, civil society, governments, and other stakeholders that they are building AI responsibly, they will need to make verifiable claims to which they can be held accountable. Those outside of a given organization also need effective means of scrutinizing such claims. This report suggests various steps that different stakeholders can take to improve the verifiability of claims made about AI systems and their associated development processes, with a focus on providing evidence about the safety, security, fairness, and privacy protection of AI systems. We analyze ten mechanisms for this purpose--spanning institutions, software, and hardware--and make recommendations aimed at implementing, exploring, or improving those mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "Advances in artificial intelligence (AI) will transform modern life by reshaping transportation, health, science, finance, and the military. To adapt public policy, we need to better anticipate these advances. Here we report the results from a large survey of machine learning researchers on their beliefs about progress in AI. Researchers predict AI will outperform humans in many activities in the next ten years, such as translating languages (by 2024), writing high-school essays (by 2026), driving a truck (by 2027), working in retail (by 2031), writing a bestselling book (by 2049), and working as a surgeon (by 2053). Researchers believe there is a 50% chance of AI outperforming humans in all tasks in 45 years and of automating all human jobs in 120 years, with Asian respondents expecting these dates much sooner than North Americans. These results will inform discussion amongst researchers and policymakers about anticipating and managing trends in AI.",

    "abstract": "Leveraging large historical data in electronic health record (EHR), we developed Doctor AI, a generic predictive model that covers observed medical conditions and medication uses. Doctor AI is a temporal model using recurrent neural networks (RNN) and was developed and applied to longitudinal time stamped EHR data from 260K patients over 8 years. Encounter records (e.g. diagnosis codes, medication codes or procedure codes) were input to RNN to predict (all) the diagnosis and medication categories for a subsequent visit. Doctor AI assesses the history of patients to make multilabel predictions (one label for each diagnosis or medication category). Based on separate blind test set evaluation, Doctor AI can perform differential diagnosis with up to 79% recall@30, significantly higher than several baselines. Moreover, we demonstrate great generalizability of Doctor AI by adapting the resulting models from one institution to another without losing substantial accuracy.",

The system itself must be able to learn when shifts in context have occurred. What are the best ways to maintain clarity around operational intent and mechanisms for adapting and evolving systems based on dynamic contexts and user needs?• Development of tools, processes, and practices to scope and facilitate human-machine teaming: Implementation of AI systems entails high levels of interdependence between human and machine. Adoption of AI systems requires the primary users to interact with and understand systems, gaining appropriate levels of trust. Every AI system needs to be designed to recognize boundaries and unfamiliar scenarios, and to provide transparency regarding its limitations.• Methods, mechanisms, and mindsets to engage in critical oversight: AI systems learn through data and observations, rather than being explicitly programmed for a deterministic outcome. Critical and reflective oversight by organizations, teams, and individuals that create and use AI systems is needed to uphold ethical principles and proactively consider the risks of bias, misuse, abuse, and unintended consequences through design, development, and ongoing deployment.For each area, we identify ongoing work as well and challenges and opportunities in developing and deploying AI systems with confidence.",

    "title": "A Survey of Embodied AI: From Simulators to Research Tasks",
    "abstract": "There has been an emerging paradigm shift from the era of “internet AI” to “embodied AI,” where AI algorithms and agents no longer learn from datasets of images, videos or text curated primarily from the internet. Instead, they learn through interactions with their environments from an egocentric perception similar to humans. Consequently, there has been substantial growth in the demand for embodied AI simulators to support various embodied AI research tasks. This growing interest in embodied AI is beneficial to the greater pursuit of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), but there has not been a contemporary and comprehensive survey of this field. This paper aims to provide an encyclopedic survey for the field of embodied AI, from its simulators to its research. By evaluating nine current embodied AI simulators with our proposed seven features, this paper aims to understand the simulators in their provision for use in embodied AI research and their limitations. Lastly, this paper surveys the three main research tasks in embodied AI – visual exploration, visual navigation and embodied question answering (QA), covering the state-of-the-art approaches, evaluation metrics and datasets. Finally, with the new insights revealed through surveying the field, the paper will provide suggestions for simulator-for-task selections and recommendations for the future directions of the field.",

    "abstract": "Digital twinning is one of the top ten technology trends in the last couple of years, due to its high applicability in the industrial sector. The integration of big data analytics and artificial intelligence/machine learning (AI-ML) techniques with digital twinning, further enriches its significance and research potential with new opportunities and unique challenges. To date, a number of scientific models have been designed and implemented related to this evolving topic. However, there is no systematic review of digital twinning, particularly focusing on the role of AI-ML and big data, to guide the academia and industry towards future developments. Therefore, this article emphasizes the role of big data and AI-ML in the creation of digital twins (DTs) or DT-based systems for various industrial applications, by highlighting the current state-of-the-art deployments. We performed a systematic review on top of multidisciplinary electronic bibliographic databases, in addition to existing patents in the field. Also, we identified development-tools that can facilitate various levels of the digital twinning. Further, we designed a big data driven and AI-enriched reference architecture that leads developers to a complete DT-enabled system. Finally, we highlighted the research potential of AI-ML for digital twinning by unveiling challenges and current opportunities.",

    "title": "What do we need to build explainable AI systems for the medical domain?",
    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) generally and machine learning (ML) specifically demonstrate impressive practical success in many different application domains, e.g. in autonomous driving, speech recognition, or recommender systems. Deep learning approaches, trained on extremely large data sets or using reinforcement learning methods have even exceeded human performance in visual tasks, particularly on playing games such as Atari, or mastering the game of Go. Even in the medical domain there are remarkable results. The central problem of such models is that they are regarded as black-box models and even if we understand the underlying mathematical principles, they lack an explicit declarative knowledge representation, hence have difficulty in generating the underlying explanatory structures. This calls for systems enabling to make decisions transparent, understandable and explainable. A huge motivation for our approach are rising legal and privacy aspects. The new European General Data Protection Regulation entering into force on May 25th 2018, will make black-box approaches difficult to use in business. This does not imply a ban on automatic learning approaches or an obligation to explain everything all the time, however, there must be a possibility to make the results re-traceable on demand. In this paper we outline some of our research topics in the context of the relatively new area of explainable-AI with a focus on the application in medicine, which is a very special domain. This is due to the fact that medical professionals are working mostly with distributed heterogeneous and complex sources of data. In this paper we concentrate on three sources: images, *omics data and text. We argue that research in explainable-AI would generally help to facilitate the implementation of AI/ML in the medical domain, and specifically help to facilitate transparency and trust.",

    "abstract": "An estimated 3 billion people lack access to dermatological care globally. Artificial intelligence (AI) may aid in triaging skin diseases and identifying malignancies. However, most AI models have not been assessed on images of diverse skin tones or uncommon diseases. Thus, we created the Diverse Dermatology Images (DDI) dataset—the first publicly available, expertly curated, and pathologically confirmed image dataset with diverse skin tones. We show that state-of-the-art dermatology AI models exhibit substantial limitations on the DDI dataset, particularly on dark skin tones and uncommon diseases. We find that dermatologists, who often label AI datasets, also perform worse on images of dark skin tones and uncommon diseases. Fine-tuning AI models on the DDI images closes the performance gap between light and dark skin tones. These findings identify important weaknesses and biases in dermatology AI that should be addressed for reliable application to diverse patients and diseases.",

    "abstract": "AI-based systems are software systems with functionalities enabled by at least one AI component (e.g., for image-, speech-recognition, and autonomous driving). AI-based systems are becoming pervasive in society due to advances in AI. However, there is limited synthesized knowledge on Software Engineering (SE) approaches for building, operating, and maintaining AI-based systems. To collect and analyze state-of-the-art knowledge about SE for AI-based systems, we conducted a systematic mapping study. We considered 248 studies published between January 2010 and March 2020. SE for AI-based systems is an emerging research area, where more than 2/3 of the studies have been published since 2018. The most studied properties of AI-based systems are dependability and safety. We identified multiple SE approaches for AI-based systems, which we classified according to the SWEBOK areas. Studies related to software testing and software quality are very prevalent, while areas like software maintenance seem neglected. Data-related issues are the most recurrent challenges. Our results are valuable for: researchers, to quickly understand the state-of-the-art and learn which topics need more research; practitioners, to learn about the approaches and challenges that SE entails for AI-based systems; and, educators, to bridge the gap among SE and AI in their curricula.",

    "title": "Intelligence Unleashed: An argument for AI in Education",
    "abstract": "This paper on artificial intelligence in education (AIEd) has two aims. The first: to explain to a non-specialist, interested, reader what AIEd is: its goals, how it is built, and how it works. The second: to set out the argument for what AIEd can offer teaching and learning, both now and in the future, with an eye towards improving learning and life outcomes for all. Computer systems that are artificially intelligent interact with the world using capabilities (such as speech recognition) and intelligent behaviours (such as using available information to take the most sensible actions toward a stated goal) that we would think of as essentially human. At the heart of artificial intelligence in education is the scientific goal to make knowledge, which is often left implicit, computationally precise and explicit. In other words, in addition to being the engine behind much ‘smart’ ed tech, AIEd is also designed to be a powerful tool to open up what is sometimes called the ‘black box of learning,’ giving us more fine-grained understandings of how learning actually happens. Although some might find the concept of AIEd alienating, the algorithms and models that underpin ed tech powered by AIEd form the basis of an essentially human endeavor. Using AIEd, teachers will be able to offer learners educational experiences that are more personalised, flexible, inclusive and engaging. Crucially, we do not see a future in which AIEd replaces teachers. What we do see is a future in which the extraordinary expertise of teachers is better leveraged and augmented through the thoughtful deployment of well designed AIEd. We have available, right now, AIEd tools that could support student learning at a scale previously unimaginable by providing one-on-one tutoring to every student, in every subject. Existing technologies also have the capacity to provide intelligent support to learners working in a group, and to create authentic virtual learning environments where students have the right support, at the right time, to tackle real-life problems and puzzles. In the near future, we expect that teaching and learning will increasingly be supported by the thoughtful application of AIEd tools. For example, by lifelong learning companions powered by AI that can accompany and support individual learners throughout their studies - in and beyond school - and new forms of assessment that measure learning while it is taking place, shaping the learning experience in real time. If we are ultimately successful, we predict that AIEd will help us address some of the most intractable problems in education, including achievement gaps and teacher retention. AIEd will also help us respond to the most significant social challenge that AI has already brought - the steady replacement of jobs and occupations with clever algorithms and robots. It is our view that this provides a new innovation imperative in education, which can be expressed simply: as humans live and work alongside increasingly smart machines, our education systems will need to achieve at levels that none have managed to date. True progress will require the development of an AIEd infrastructure. This will not, however, be a single monolithic AIEd system. Instead, it will resemble the marketplace that has developed for smartphone apps: hundreds and then thousands of individual AIEd components, developed in collaboration with educators, conformed to uniform international data standards, and shared with researchers and developers worldwide. These standards will also enable system-level data collation and analysis that will help us to learn much more about learning itself – and how to improve it. Moving forward, we will need to pay close attention to three powerful forces as we map the future of artificial intelligence in education, namely pedagogy, technology, and system change. Paying attention to the pedagogy will mean that the design of new edtech should always start with what we know about learning. It also means that the system for funding this work must be simultaneously opened up and refocused, moving away from isolated pockets of R&D and toward collaborative enterprises that prioritise areas known to make a real difference to teaching and learning. Paying attention to the technology will mean creating smarter demand for commercial grade AIEd products that work. It also means the development of a robust, component-based AIEd infrastructure, similar to the smartphone app marketplace, where researchers and developers can access standardised components that have been developed in collaboration with educators. Paying attention to system change will mean involving teachers, students, and parents in co-designing new tools, so that AIEd will appropriately address the inherent “messiness” of real classroom, university, and workplace learning environments. It also means the development of data standards that promote the safe and ethical use of data. Said succinctly, we need intelligent technologies that embody what we know about great teaching and learning, embodied in enticing consumer grade products, which are then used effectively in real-life settings that combine the best of human and machine. We do not underestimate the new-thinking, inevitable wrong-turns, and effort required to realise these recommendations. However, if we are to properly unleash the intelligence of AIEd, we must do things differently - via new collaborations, sensible funding, and (always) a keen eye on the pedagogy. The potential prize is too great to act otherwise.",

    "abstract": "Digital twin (DT) and artificial intelligence (AI) technologies have grown rapidly in recent years and are considered by both academia and industry to be key enablers for Industry 4.0. As a digital replica of a physical entity, the basis of DT is the infrastructure and data, the core is the algorithm and model, and the application is the software and service. The grounding of DT and AI in industrial sectors is even more dependent on the systematic and in-depth integration of domain-specific expertise. This survey comprehensively reviews over 300 manuscripts on AI-driven DT technologies of Industry 4.0 used over the past five years and summarizes their general developments and the current state of AI-integration in the fields of smart manufacturing and advanced robotics. These cover conventional sophisticated metal machining and industrial automation as well as emerging techniques, such as 3D printing and human–robot interaction/cooperation. Furthermore, advantages of AI-driven DTs in the context of sustainable development are elaborated. Practical challenges and development prospects of AI-driven DTs are discussed with a respective focus on different levels. A route for AI-integration in multiscale/fidelity DTs with multiscale/fidelity data sources in Industry 4.0 is outlined.",

    "title": "Trustworthy AI: A Computational Perspective",
    "abstract": "In the past few decades, artificial intelligence (AI) technology has experienced swift developments, changing everyone’s daily life and profoundly altering the course of human society. The intention behind developing AI was and is to benefit humans by reducing labor, increasing everyday conveniences, and promoting social good. However, recent research and AI applications indicate that AI can cause unintentional harm to humans by, for example, making unreliable decisions in safety-critical scenarios or undermining fairness by inadvertently discriminating against a group or groups. Consequently, trustworthy AI has recently garnered increased attention regarding the need to avoid the adverse effects that AI could bring to people, so people can fully trust and live in harmony with AI technologies. A tremendous amount of research on trustworthy AI has been conducted and witnessed in recent years. In this survey, we present a comprehensive appraisal of trustworthy AI from a computational perspective to help readers understand the latest technologies for achieving trustworthy AI. Trustworthy AI is a large and complex subject, involving various dimensions. In this work, we focus on six of the most crucial dimensions in achieving trustworthy AI: (i) Safety & Robustness, (ii) Nondiscrimination & Fairness, (iii) Explainability, (iv) Privacy, (v) Accountability & Auditability, and (vi) Environmental Well-being. For each dimension, we review the recent related technologies according to a taxonomy and summarize their applications in real-world systems. We also discuss the accordant and conflicting interactions among different dimensions and discuss potential aspects for trustworthy AI to investigate in the future.",

    "abstract": "The field of artificial intelligence (AI) has evolved considerably in the last 60 years. While there are now many AI applications that have been deployed in high-income country contexts, use in resource-poor settings remains relatively nascent. With a few notable exceptions, there are limited examples of AI being used in such settings. However, there are signs that this is changing. Several high-profile meetings have been convened in recent years to discuss the development and deployment of AI applications to reduce poverty and deliver a broad range of critical public services. We provide a general overview of AI and how it can be used to improve health outcomes in resource-poor settings. We also describe some of the current ethical debates around patient safety and privacy. Despite current challenges, AI holds tremendous promise for transforming the provision of healthcare services in resource-poor settings. Many health system hurdles in such settings could be overcome with the use of AI and other complementary emerging technologies. Further research and investments in the development of AI tools tailored to resource-poor settings will accelerate realising of the full potential of AI for improving global health.",

    "abstract": "Decisions made by human-AI teams (e.g., AI-advised humans) are increasingly common in high-stakes domains such as healthcare, criminal justice, and finance. Achieving high team performance depends on more than just the accuracy of the AI system: Since the human and the AI may have different expertise, the highest team performance is often reached when they both know how and when to complement one another. We focus on a factor that is crucial to supporting such complementary: the human’s mental model of the AI capabilities, specifically the AI system’s error boundary (i.e. knowing “When does the AI err?”). Awareness of this lets the human decide when to accept or override the AI’s recommendation. We highlight two key properties of an AI’s error boundary, parsimony and stochasticity, and a property of the task, dimensionality. We show experimentally how these properties affect humans’ mental models of AI capabilities and the resulting team performance. We connect our evaluations to related work and propose goals, beyond accuracy, that merit consideration during model selection and optimization to improve overall human-AI team performance.",

    "title": "AI in Finance: Challenges, Techniques, and Opportunities",
    "abstract": "AI in finance refers to the applications of AI techniques in financial businesses. This area has attracted attention for decades, with both classic and modern AI techniques applied to increasingly broader areas of finance, economy, and society. In contrast to reviews on discussing the problems, aspects, and opportunities of finance benefited from specific or some new-generation AI and data science (AIDS) techniques or the progress of applying specific techniques to resolving certain financial problems, this review offers a comprehensive and dense landscape of the overwhelming challenges, techniques, and opportunities of AIDS research in finance over the past decades. The challenges of financial businesses and data are first outlined, followed by a comprehensive categorization and a dense overview of the decades of AIDS research in finance. We then structure and illustrate the data-driven analytics and learning of financial businesses and data. A comparison, criticism, and discussion of classic versus modern AIDS techniques for finance follows. Finally, the open issues and opportunities to address future AIDS-empowered finance and finance-motivated AIDS research are discussed.",

    "abstract": "Explainable artificially intelligent (XAI) systems form part of sociotechnical systems, e.g., human+AI teams tasked with making decisions. Yet, current XAI systems are rarely evaluated by measuring the performance of human+AI teams on actual decision-making tasks. We conducted two online experiments and one in-person think-aloud study to evaluate two currently common techniques for evaluating XAI systems: (1) using proxy, artificial tasks such as how well humans predict the AI's decision from the given explanations, and (2) using subjective measures of trust and preference as predictors of actual performance. The results of our experiments demonstrate that evaluations with proxy tasks did not predict the results of the evaluations with the actual decision-making tasks. Further, the subjective measures on evaluations with actual decision-making tasks did not predict the objective performance on those same tasks. Our results suggest that by employing misleading evaluation methods, our field may be inadvertently slowing its progress toward developing human+AI teams that can reliably perform better than humans or AIs alone.",

    "title": "Talking AI into Being: The Narratives and Imaginaries of National AI Strategies and Their Performative Politics",
    "abstract": "How to integrate artificial intelligence (AI) technologies in the functioning and structures of our society has become a concern of contemporary politics and public debates. In this paper, we investigate national AI strategies as a peculiar form of co-shaping this development, a hybrid of policy and discourse that offers imaginaries, allocates resources, and sets rules. Conceptually, the paper is informed by sociotechnical imaginaries, the sociology of expectations, myths, and the sublime. Empirically we analyze AI policy documents of four key players in the field, namely China, the United States, France, and Germany. The results show that the narrative construction of AI strategies is strikingly similar: they all establish AI as an inevitable and massively disrupting technological development by building on rhetorical devices such as a grand legacy and international competition. Having established this inevitable, yet uncertain, AI future, national leaders proclaim leadership intervention and articulate opportunities and distinct national pathways. While this narrative construction is quite uniform, the respective AI imaginaries are remarkably different, reflecting the vast cultural, political, and economic differences of the countries under study. As governments endow these imaginary pathways with massive resources and investments, they contribute to coproducing the installment of these futures and, thus, yield a performative lock-in function.",

    "title": "Contributions and Risks of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in Building Smarter Cities: Insights from a Systematic Review of the Literature",
    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) is one of the most disruptive technologies of our time. Interest in the use of AI for urban innovation continues to grow. Particularly, the rise of smart cities—urban locations that are enabled by community, technology, and policy to deliver productivity, innovation, livability, wellbeing, sustainability, accessibility, good governance, and good planning—has increased the demand for AI-enabled innovations. There is, nevertheless, no scholarly work that provides a comprehensive review on the topic. This paper generates insights into how AI can contribute to the development of smarter cities. A systematic review of the literature is selected as the methodologic approach. Results are categorized under the main smart city development dimensions, i.e., economy, society, environment, and governance. The findings of the systematic review containing 93 articles disclose that: (a) AI in the context of smart cities is an emerging field of research and practice. (b) The central focus of the literature is on AI technologies, algorithms, and their current and prospective applications. (c) AI applications in the context of smart cities mainly concentrate on business efficiency, data analytics, education, energy, environmental sustainability, health, land use, security, transport, and urban management areas. (d) There is limited scholarly research investigating the risks of wider AI utilization. (e) Upcoming disruptions of AI in cities and societies have not been adequately examined. Current and potential contributions of AI to the development of smarter cities are outlined in this paper to inform scholars of prospective areas for further research.",

    "title": "Towards a Science of Human-AI Decision Making: A Survey of Empirical Studies",
    "abstract": "As AI systems demonstrate increasingly strong predictive performance, their adoption has grown in numerous domains. However, in high-stakes domains such as criminal justice and healthcare, full automation is often not desirable due to safety, ethical, and legal concerns, yet fully manual approaches can be inaccurate and time consuming. As a result, there is growing interest in the research community to augment human decision making with AI assistance. Besides developing AI technologies for this purpose, the emerging field of human-AI decision making must embrace empirical approaches to form a foundational understanding of how humans interact and work with AI to make decisions. To invite and help structure research efforts towards a science of understanding and improving human-AI decision making, we survey recent literature of empirical human-subject studies on this topic. We summarize the study design choices made in over 100 papers in three important aspects: (1) decision tasks, (2) AI models and AI assistance elements, and (3) evaluation metrics. For each aspect, we summarize current trends, discuss gaps in current practices of the field, and make a list of recommendations for future research. Our survey highlights the need to develop common frameworks to account for the design and research spaces of human-AI decision making, so that researchers can make rigorous choices in study design, and the research community can build on each other's work and produce generalizable scientific knowledge. We also hope this survey will serve as a bridge for HCI and AI communities to work together to mutually shape the empirical science and computational technologies for human-AI decision making.",

    "title": "To engage or not to engage with AI for critical judgments: How professionals deal with opacity when using AI for medical diagnosis",
    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) technologies promise to transform how professionals conduct knowledge work by augmenting their capabilities for making professional judgments. We know little, however, about how human-AI augmentation takes place in practice. Yet, gaining this understanding is particularly important when professionals use AI tools to form judgments on critical decisions. We conducted an in-depth field study in a major U.S. hospital where AI tools were used in three departments by diagnostic radiologists making breast cancer, lung cancer, and bone age determinations. The study illustrates the hindering effects of opacity that professionals experienced when using AI tools and explores how these professionals grappled with it in practice. In all three departments, this opacity resulted in professionals experiencing increased uncertainty because AI tool results often diverged from their initial judgment without providing underlying reasoning. Only in one department (of the three) did professionals consistently incorporate AI results into their final judgments, achieving what we call engaged augmentation. These professionals invested in AI interrogation practices—practices enacted by human experts to relate their own knowledge claims to AI knowledge claims. Professionals in the other two departments did not enact such practices and did not incorporate AI inputs into their final decisions, which we call unengaged “augmentation.” Our study unpacks the challenges involved in augmenting professional judgment with powerful, yet opaque, technologies and contributes to literature on AI adoption in knowledge work.",

The push toward automated content moderation is often justified as a necessary response to the scale: the enormity of social media platforms like Facebook and YouTube stands as the reason why AI approaches are desirable, even inevitable. But even if we could effectively automate content moderation, it is not clear that we should.",

    "abstract": "With the global rollout of fifth generation (5G) networks, it is necessary to look beyond 5G and envision 6G networks. 6G networks are expected to have space-air-ground integrated networks, advanced network virtualization, and ubiquitous intelligence. This article presents an artificial intelligence (AI)-native network slicing architecture for 6G networks to enable the synergy of AI and network slicing, thereby facilitating intelligent network management and supporting emerging AI services. AI-based solutions are first discussed across the network slicing life cycle to intelligently manage network slices (i.e., AI for slicing). Then network slicing solutions are studied to support emerging AI services by constructing AI instances and performing efficient resource management (i.e., slicing for AI). Finally, a case study is presented, followed by a discussion of open research issues that are essential for AI-native network slicing in 6G networks.",

In this regard, this study examines AI studies in education in half a century (1970–2020) through a systematic review approach and benefits from social network analysis and text-mining approaches. Accordingly, the research identifies three research clusters (1) artificial intelligence, (2) pedagogical, and (3) technological issues, and suggests five broad research themes which are (1) adaptive learning and personalization of education through AI-based practices, (2) deep learning and machine Learning algorithms for online learning processes, (3) Educational human-AI interaction, (4) educational use of AI-generated data, and (5) AI in higher education. The study also highlights that ethics in AI studies is an ignored research area.",

    "abstract": "In this experience report, we describe an AI summer workshop designed to prepare middle school students to become informed citizens and critical consumers of AI technology and to develop their foundational knowledge and skills to support future endeavors as AI-empowered workers. The workshop featured the 30-hour \"Developing AI Literacy\" or DAILy curriculum that is grounded in literature on child development, ethics education, and career development. The participants in the workshop were students between the ages of 10 and 14; 87% were from underrepresented groups in STEM and Computing. In this paper we describe the online curriculum, its implementation during synchronous online workshop sessions in summer of 2020, and preliminary findings on student outcomes. We reflect on the successes and lessons we learned in terms of supporting students' engagement and conceptual learning of AI, shifting attitudes toward AI, and fostering conceptions of future selves as AI-enabled workers. We conclude with discussions of the affordances and barriers to bringing AI education to students from underrepresented groups in STEM and Computing.",

The growing number of investments managed by artificial intelligence (AI) suggests that this technology-based service will become increasingly popular. This study examines how customers' technology readiness and service awareness affect their intention to use analytical AI investment services.Design/methodology/approachThe automation of services is rapidly growing, led by sectors such as banking and financial investment. The growing number of investments managed by AI suggests that this technology-based service will become increasingly popular. This study examines how customers' technology readiness and service awareness affect their intention to use analytical AI investment services.FindingsThe results indicated that customers' technological optimism increases, and insecurity decreases, their intention to use robo-advisors. Surprisingly, feelings of technological discomfort positively influenced robo-advisor adoption. This interesting finding challenges previous insights into technology adoption and value co-creation as analytical AI puts customers into a very passive role and reduces barriers to technology adoption. The research also analyzes how consumers become aware of robo-advisors, and how this influences their acceptance.Originality/valueThis is the first study to analyze the role of customers' technology readiness in the adoption of analytical AI. The authors link the findings to previous technology adoption and automated services' literature and provide specific managerial implications and avenues for further research.",

    "title": "The Oxford Handbook of Ethics of AI",
    "abstract": "This book explores the intertwining domains of artificial intelligence (AI) and ethics—two highly divergent fields which at first seem to have nothing to do with one another. AI is a collection of computational methods for studying human knowledge, learning, and behavior, including by building agents able to know, learn, and behave. Ethics is a body of human knowledge—far from completely understood—that helps agents (humans today, but perhaps eventually robots and other AIs) decide how they and others should behave. Despite these differences, however, the rapid development in AI technology today has led to a growing number of ethical issues in a multitude of fields, ranging from disciplines as far-reaching as international human rights law to issues as intimate as personal identity and sexuality. In fact, the number and variety of topics in this volume illustrate the width, diversity of content, and at times exasperating vagueness of the boundaries of “AI Ethics” as a domain of inquiry. Within this discourse, the book points to the capacity of sociotechnical systems that utilize data-driven algorithms to classify, to make decisions, and to control complex systems. Given the wide-reaching and often intimate impact these AI systems have on daily human lives, this volume attempts to address the increasingly complicated relations between humanity and artificial intelligence. It considers not only how humanity must conduct themselves toward AI but also how AI must behave toward humanity.",

    "abstract": "We describe a framework for research and evaluation in Embodied AI. Our proposal is based on a canonical task: Rearrangement. A standard task can focus the development of new techniques and serve as a source of trained models that can be transferred to other settings. In the rearrangement task, the goal is to bring a given physical environment into a specified state. The goal state can be specified by object poses, by images, by a description in language, or by letting the agent experience the environment in the goal state. We characterize rearrangement scenarios along different axes and describe metrics for benchmarking rearrangement performance. To facilitate research and exploration, we present experimental testbeds of rearrangement scenarios in four different simulation environments. We anticipate that other datasets will be released and new simulation platforms will be built to support training of rearrangement agents and their deployment on physical systems.",

    "abstract": "While generative deep neural networks (DNNs) have demonstrated their capacity for creating novel musical compositions, less attention has been paid to the challenges and potential of co-creating with these musical AIs, especially for novices. In a needfinding study with a widely used, interactive musical AI, we found that the AI can overwhelm users with the amount of musical content it generates, and frustrate them with its non-deterministic output. To better match co-creation needs, we developed AI-steering tools, consisting of Voice Lanes that restrict content generation to particular voices; Example-Based Sliders to control the similarity of generated content to an existing example; Semantic Sliders to nudge music generation in high-level directions (happy/sad, conventional/surprising); and Multiple Alternatives of generated content to audition and choose from. In a summative study (N=21), we discovered the tools not only increased users' trust, control, comprehension, and sense of collaboration with the AI, but also contributed to a greater sense of self-efficacy and ownership of the composition relative to the AI.",

    "title": "Industry 4.0 in Finance: The Impact of Artificial Intelligence (AI) on Digital Financial Inclusion",
    "abstract": "This study sought to investigate the impact of AI on digital financial inclusion. Digital financial inclusion is becoming central in the debate on how to ensure that people who are at the lower levels of the pyramid become financially active. Fintech companies are using AI and its various applications to ensure that the goal of digital financial inclusion is realized that is to ensure that low-income earners, the poor, women, youths, small businesses participate in the mainstream financial market. This study used conceptual and documentary analysis of peer-reviewed journals, reports and other authoritative documents on AI and digital financial inclusion to assess the impact of AI on digital financial inclusion. The present study discovered that AI has a strong influence on digital financial inclusion in areas related to risk detection, measurement and management, addressing the problem of information asymmetry, availing customer support and helpdesk through chatbots and fraud detection and cybersecurity. Therefore, it is recommended that financial institutions and non-financial institutions and governments across the world adopt and scale up the use of AI tools and applications as they present benefits in the quest to ensure that the vulnerable groups of people who are not financially active do participate in the formal financial market with minimum challenges and maximum benefits.",

    "abstract": "What explains the dramatic progress from 20th-century to 21st-century AI, and how can the remaining limitations of current AI be overcome? The widely accepted narrative attributes this progress to massive increases in the quantity of computational and data resources available to support statistical learning in deep artificial neural networks. We show that an additional crucial factor is the development of a new type of computation. Neurocompositional computing adopts two principles that must be simultaneously respected to enable human-level cognition: the principles of Compositionality and Continuity. These have seemed irreconcilable until the recent mathematical discovery that compositionality can be realized not only through discrete methods of symbolic computing, but also through novel forms of continuous neural computing. The revolutionary recent progress in AI has resulted from the use of limited forms of neurocompositional computing. New, deeper forms of neurocompositional computing create AI systems that are more robust, accurate, and comprehensible.",

To this end, the ETSI Zero-touch network and Service Management (ZSM) framework is envisaged as a next-generation management system that aims to have all operational processes and tasks executed automatically, ideally with 100 percent automation. Artificial Intelligence (AI) is envisioned as a key enabler of self-managing capabilities, resulting in lower operational costs, accelerated time-tovalue and reduced risk of human error. Nevertheless, the growing enthusiasm for leveraging AI in a ZSM system should not overlook the potential limitations and risks of using AI techniques. The current paper aims to introduce the ZSM concept and point out the AI-based limitations and risks that need to be addressed in order to make ZSM a reality.",

    "title": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) Ethics: Ethics of AI and Ethical AI",
    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI)-based technology has achieved many great things, such as facial recognition, medical diagnosis, and self-driving cars. AI promises enormous benefits for economic growth, social development, as well as human well-being and safety improvement. However, the low-level of explainability, data biases, data security, data privacy, and ethical problems of AI-based technology pose significant risks for users, developers, humanity, and societies. As AI advances, one critical issue is how to address the ethical and moral challenges associated with AI. Even though the concept of “machine ethics” was proposed around 2006, AI ethics is still in the infancy stage. AI ethics is the field related to the study of ethical issues in AI. To address AI ethics, one needs to consider the ethics of AI and how to build ethical AI. Ethics of AI studies the ethical principles, rules, guidelines, policies, and regulations that are related to AI. Ethical AI is an AI that performs and behaves ethically. One must recognize and understand the potential ethical and moral issues that may be caused by AI to formulate the necessary ethical principles, rules, guidelines, policies, and regulations for AI (i.e., Ethics of AI). With the appropriate ethics of AI, one can then build AI that exhibits ethical behavior (i.e., Ethical AI). This paper will discuss AI ethics by looking at the ethics of AI and ethical AI. What are the perceived ethical and moral issues with AI? What are the general and common ethical principles, rules, guidelines, policies, and regulations that can resolve or at least attenuate these ethical and moral issues with AI? What are some of the necessary features and characteristics of an ethical AI? How to adhere to the ethics of AI to build ethical AI?",

    "abstract": "In the current era, people and society have grown increasingly reliant on artificial intelligence (AI) technologies. AI has the potential to drive us towards a future in which all of humanity flourishes. It also comes with substantial risks for oppression and calamity. Discussions about whether we should (re)trust AI have repeatedly emerged in recent years and in many quarters, including industry, academia, healthcare, services, and so on. Technologists and AI researchers have a responsibility to develop trustworthy AI systems. They have responded with great effort to design more responsible AI algorithms. However, existing technical solutions are narrow in scope and have been primarily directed towards algorithms for scoring or classification tasks, with an emphasis on fairness and unwanted bias. To build long-lasting trust between AI and human beings, we argue that the key is to think beyond algorithmic fairness and connect major aspects of AI that potentially cause AI’s indifferent behavior. In this survey, we provide a systematic framework of Socially Responsible AI Algorithms that aims to examine the subjects of AI indifference and the need for socially responsible AI algorithms, define the objectives, and introduce the means by which we may achieve these objectives. We further discuss how to leverage this framework to improve societal well-being through protection, information, and prevention/mitigation. \nThis article appears in the special track on AI & Society.",

    "abstract": "Contributions: The Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK)-Jockey Club AI for the Future Project (AI4Future) co-created the first pretertiary AI curriculum at the secondary school level for Hong Kong and evaluated its efficacy. This study added to the AI education community by introducing a new AI curriculum framework. The preposttest multifactors evaluation about students’ perceptions of AI learning confirmed that the curriculum is effective in promoting AI learning. The teachers also confirmed the co-creation process enhanced their capacity to implement AI education. Background: AI4Future is a cross-sector project that engages five major partners—CUHK’s Faculty of Engineering and Faculty of Education, secondary schools, Hong Kong government, and AI industry. A team of 14 professors collaborated with 17 principals and teachers from six secondary schools to co-create the curriculum. Research Questions: Would the curriculum significantly improve the student perceived competence, attitude, and motivation toward AI learning? How does the co-creation process benefit the implementation of the curriculum? Methodology: The participants were 335 students and eight teachers from the secondary schools. This study adopted a mix-method with quantitative data measures at pre- and post-questionnaires and qualitative data emphasizes teachers’ perspectives on the co-creation process. Paired ${t}$ -tests and ANCOVAs, and thematic analysis were used to analyze the data. Findings: 1) students perceived greater competence and developed a more positive attitude to learn AI and 2) the co-creation process enhanced teachers’ knowledge in AI, as well as fostered teachers’ autonomy in bringing the subject matter into their classrooms.",

    "title": "Is the Most Accurate AI the Best Teammate? Optimizing AI for Teamwork",
    "abstract": "AI practitioners typically strive to develop the most accurate systems, making an implicit assumption that the AI system will function autonomously. However, in practice, AI systems often are used to provide advice to people in domains ranging from criminal justice and finance to healthcare. In such AI-advised decision making, humans and machines form a team, where the human is responsible for making final decisions. But is the most accurate AI the best teammate? We argue \"not necessarily\" --- predictable performance may be worth a slight sacrifice in AI accuracy. Instead, we argue that AI systems should be trained in a human-centered manner, directly optimized for team performance. We study this proposal for a specific type of human-AI teaming, where the human overseer chooses to either accept the AI recommendation or solve the task themselves. To optimize the team performance for this setting we maximize the team's expected utility, expressed in terms of the quality of the final decision, cost of verifying, and individual accuracies of people and machines. Our experiments with linear and non-linear models on real-world, high-stakes datasets show that the most accuracy AI may not lead to highest team performance and show the benefit of modeling teamwork during training through improvements in expected team utility across datasets, considering parameters such as human skill and the cost of mistakes. We discuss the shortcoming of current optimization approaches beyond well-studied loss functions such as log-loss, and encourage future work on AI optimization problems motivated by human-AI collaboration.",

    "title": "Responsible AI Systems: Who are the Stakeholders?",
    "abstract": "As of 2021, there were more than 170 guidelines on AI ethics and responsible, trustworthy AI in circulation according to the AI Ethics Guidelines Global Inventory maintained by AlgorithmWatch, an organisation which tracks the effects of increased digitalisation on everyday lives. However, from the perspective of day-to-day work, for those engaged in designing, developing, and maintaining AI systems identifying relevant guidelines and translating them into practice presents a challenge. The aim of this paper is to help anyone engaged in building a responsible AI system by identifying an indicative long-list of potential stakeholders. This list of impacted stakeholders is intended to enable such AI system builders to decide which guidelines are most suited to their practice. The paper draws on a literature review of articles short-listed based on searches conducted in the ACM Digital Library and Google Scholar. The findings are based on content analysis of the short-listed literature guided by probes which draw on the ISO 26000:2010 Guidance on social responsibility. The paper identifies three levels of potentially relevant stakeholders when responsible AI systems are considered: individual stakeholders (including users, developers, and researchers), organisational stakeholders, and national / international stakeholders engaged in making laws, rules, and regulations. The main intended audience for this paper is software, requirements, and product engineers engaged in building AI systems. In addition, business executives, policy makers, legal/regulatory experts, AI researchers, public, private, and third sector organisations developing responsible AI guidelines, and anyone interested in seeing functional responsible AI systems are the other intended audience for this paper.",

    "title": "“Brilliant AI Doctor” in Rural Clinics: Challenges in AI-Powered Clinical Decision Support System Deployment",
    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) technology has been increasingly used in the implementation of advanced Clinical Decision Support Systems (CDSS). Research demonstrated the potential usefulness of AI-powered CDSS (AI-CDSS) in clinical decision making scenarios. However, post-adoption user perception and experience remain understudied, especially in developing countries. Through observations and interviews with 22 clinicians from 6 rural clinics in China, this paper reports the various tensions between the design of an AI-CDSS system (“Brilliant Doctor”) and the rural clinical context, such as the misalignment with local context and workflow, the technical limitations and usability barriers, as well as issues related to transparency and trustworthiness of AI-CDSS. Despite these tensions, all participants expressed positive attitudes toward the future of AI-CDSS, especially acting as “a doctor’s AI assistant” to realize a Human-AI Collaboration future in clinical settings. Finally we draw on our findings to discuss implications for designing AI-CDSS interventions for rural clinical contexts in developing countries.",

    "title": "The Wrong Kind of Ai? Artificial Intelligence and the Future of Labor Demand",
    "abstract": "\n Artificial intelligence (AI) is set to influence every aspect of our lives, not least the way production is organised. AI, as a technology platform, can automate tasks previously performed by labour or create new tasks and activities in which humans can be productively employed. Recent technological change has been biased towards automation, with insufficient focus on creating new tasks where labour can be productively employed. The consequences of this choice have been stagnating labour demand, declining labour share in national income, rising inequality and lowering productivity growth. The current tendency is to develop AI in the direction of further automation, but this might mean missing out on the promise of the ‘right’ kind of AI, with better economic and social outcomes.",

Thus, this review is necessarily selective. That said, most of the key concepts and issues are expressed in this Report. The Report encapsulates the history of computer science efforts to create systems that explain and instruct (intelligent tutoring systems and expert systems). The Report expresses the explainability issues and challenges in modern AI, and presents capsule views of the leading psychological theories of explanation. Certain articles stand out by virtue of their particular relevance to XAI, and their methods, results, and key points are highlighted. It is recommended that AI/XAI researchers be encouraged to include in their research reports fuller details on their empirical or experimental methods, in the fashion of experimental psychology research reports: details on Participants, Instructions, Procedures, Tasks, Dependent Variables (operational definitions of the measures and metrics), Independent Variables (conditions), and Control Conditions.",

    "title": "Transitioning to Human Interaction with AI Systems: New Challenges and Opportunities for HCI Professionals to Enable Human-Centered AI",
    "abstract": "Abstract While AI has benefited humans, it may also harm humans if not appropriately developed. The priority of current HCI work should focus on transiting from conventional human interaction with non-AI computing systems to interaction with AI systems. We conducted a high-level literature review and a holistic analysis of current work in developing AI systems from an HCI perspective. Our review and analysis highlight the new changes introduced by AI technology and the new challenges that HCI professionals face when applying the human-centered AI (HCAI) approach in the development of AI systems. We also identified seven main issues in human interaction with AI systems, which HCI professionals did not encounter when developing non-AI computing systems. To further enable the implementation of the HCAI approach, we identified new HCI opportunities tied to specific HCAI-driven design goals to guide HCI professionals addressing these new issues. Finally, our assessment of current HCI methods shows the limitations of these methods in support of developing HCAI systems. We propose the alternative methods that can help overcome these limitations and effectively help HCI professionals apply the HCAI approach to the development of AI systems. We also offer strategic recommendation for HCI professionals to effectively influence the development of AI systems with the HCAI approach, eventually developing HCAI systems.",

    "abstract": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) is at the top of the agenda for education leaders today in educating the next generation across the globe. However, public understanding of AI technologies and how to define AI literacy is under‐explored. This vision poses upcoming challenges for our next generation to learn about AI. On this note, an exploratory review was conducted to conceptualize the newly emerging concept “AI literacy”, in search for a sound theoretical foundation to define, teach and evaluate AI literacy. Grounded in literature on 18 existing peer‐reviewed articles, this review proposed four aspects (i.e, know and understand, use, evaluate, and ethical issues) for fostering AI literacy based on the adaptation of classic literacies. This study sheds light on the consolidated definition, teaching, and ethical concerns on AI literacy, establishing the groundwork for future research such as competency development and assessment criteria on AI literacy.",

    "title": "Truthful AI: Developing and governing AI that does not lie",
    "abstract": "In many contexts, lying – the use of verbal falsehoods to deceive – is harmful. While lying has traditionally been a human affair, AI systems that make sophisticated verbal statements are becoming increasingly prevalent. This raises the question of how we should limit the harm caused by AI “lies” (i.e. falsehoods that are actively selected for). Human truthfulness is governed by social norms and by laws (against defamation, perjury, and fraud). Differences between AI and humans present an opportunity to have more precise standards of truthfulness for AI, and to have these standards rise over time. This could provide significant benefits to public epistemics and the economy, and mitigate risks of worst-case AI futures. Establishing norms or laws of AI truthfulness will require significant work to: 1. identify clear truthfulness standards; 2. create institutions that can judge adherence to those standards; and 3. develop AI systems that are robustly truthful. Our initial proposals for these areas include: 1. a standard of avoiding “negligent falsehoods” (a generalisation of lies that is easier to assess); 2. institutions to evaluate AI systems before and after real-world deployment; 3. explicitly training AI systems to be truthful via curated datasets and human interaction. A concerning possibility is that evaluation mechanisms for eventual truthfulness standards could be captured by political interests, leading to harmful censorship and propaganda. Avoiding this might take careful attention. And since the scale of AI speech acts might grow dramatically over the coming decades, early truthfulness standards might be particularly important because of the precedents they set. ar X iv :2 11 0. 06 67 4v 1 [ cs .C Y ] 1 3 O ct 2 02 1",

    "abstract": "Abstract Brand endorsers can contribute to a brand’s success or failure (in the case of endorser transgressions). Recent advancements in technology have produced new, nonhuman alternatives to traditional celebrity endorsers. These new endorsers rely on artificial intelligence (AI) to interact with and influence consumers. Two studies demonstrate that AI influencers can produce positive brand benefits similar to those produced by human celebrity endorsers. Moreover, just like their human counterparts, AI influencers can also commit transgressions that result in degradation of the endorsed brand. Importantly, though, AI influencers differ from human celebrity endorsers in that consumers are less likely to view them as unique entities (as tested in a pilot study). Thus, consumers are more likely to perceive a transgression committed by an AI influencer as behavior applicable to all AI influencers, but they are less likely to view celebrity endorser behaviors as interchangeable. As such, after an AI influencer has committed a transgression, replacing the AI influencer with a celebrity endorser attenuates negative brand perceptions, an effect which cannot be realized if the replacement is another AI influencer.",

Although these people-focused tasks have always been important to jobs, they are now becoming more important to an unprecedented degree. To manage more effectively in the Feeling Economy, managers must adapt the nature of jobs to compensate for the fact that many of the analytical and thinking tasks are increasingly being performed by AI, and, thus, human workers must place increased emphasis on the empathetic and emotional dimensions of their work.",

    "abstract": "Problems of cooperation--in which agents seek ways to jointly improve their welfare--are ubiquitous and important. They can be found at scales ranging from our daily routines--such as driving on highways, scheduling meetings, and working collaboratively--to our global challenges--such as peace, commerce, and pandemic preparedness. Arguably, the success of the human species is rooted in our ability to cooperate. Since machines powered by artificial intelligence are playing an ever greater role in our lives, it will be important to equip them with the capabilities necessary to cooperate and to foster cooperation. \nWe see an opportunity for the field of artificial intelligence to explicitly focus effort on this class of problems, which we term Cooperative AI. The objective of this research would be to study the many aspects of the problems of cooperation and to innovate in AI to contribute to solving these problems. Central goals include building machine agents with the capabilities needed for cooperation, building tools to foster cooperation in populations of (machine and/or human) agents, and otherwise conducting AI research for insight relevant to problems of cooperation. This research integrates ongoing work on multi-agent systems, game theory and social choice, human-machine interaction and alignment, natural-language processing, and the construction of social tools and platforms. However, Cooperative AI is not the union of these existing areas, but rather an independent bet about the productivity of specific kinds of conversations that involve these and other areas. We see opportunity to more explicitly focus on the problem of cooperation, to construct unified theory and vocabulary, and to build bridges with adjacent communities working on cooperation, including in the natural, social, and behavioural sciences.",

    "abstract": "The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) is changing our lives in many ways. One application domain is data science. New techniques in automating the creation of AI, known as AutoAI or AutoML, aim to automate the work practices of data scientists. AutoAI systems are capable of autonomously ingesting and pre-processing data, engineering new features, and creating and scoring models based on a target objectives (e.g. accuracy or run-time efficiency). Though not yet widely adopted, we are interested in understanding how AutoAI will impact the practice of data science. We conducted interviews with 20 data scientists who work at a large, multinational technology company and practice data science in various business settings. Our goal is to understand their current work practices and how these practices might change with AutoAI. Reactions were mixed: while informants expressed concerns about the trend of automating their jobs, they also strongly felt it was inevitable. Despite these concerns, they remained optimistic about their future job security due to a view that the future of data science work will be a collaboration between humans and AI systems, in which both automation and human expertise are indispensable.",

    "abstract": "Recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) technologies have induced tremendous growth in innovation and automation. Although these AI technologies offer significant benefits, they can be used maliciously. Highly targeted and evasive attacks in benign carrier applications, such as DeepLocker, have demonstrated the intentional use of AI for harmful purposes. Threat actors are constantly changing and improving their attack strategy with particular emphasis on the application of AI-driven techniques in the attack process, called AI-based cyber attack, which can be used in conjunction with conventional attack techniques to cause greater damage. Despite several studies on AI and security, researchers have not summarized AI-based cyber attacks enough to be able to understand the adversary’s actions and to develop proper defenses against such attacks. This study aims to explore existing studies of AI-based cyber attacks and to map them onto a proposed framework, providing insight into new threats. Our framework includes the classification of several aspects of malicious uses of AI during the cyber attack life cycle and provides a basis for their detection to predict future threats. We also explain how to apply this framework to analyze AI-based cyber attacks in a hypothetical scenario of a critical smart grid infrastructure.",

    "abstract": "AI systems are being deployed to support human decision making in high-stakes domains such as healthcare and criminal justice. In many cases, the human and AI form a team, in which the human makes decisions after reviewing the AI’s inferences. A successful partnership requires that the human develops insights into the performance of the AI system, including its failures. We study the influence of updates to an AI system in this setting. While updates can increase the AI’s predictive performance, they may also lead to behavioral changes that are at odds with the user’s prior experiences and confidence in the AI’s inferences. We show that updates that increase AI performance may actually hurt team performance. We introduce the notion of the compatibility of an AI update with prior user experience and present methods for studying the role of compatibility in human-AI teams. Empirical results on three high-stakes classification tasks show that current machine learning algorithms do not produce compatible updates. We propose a re-training objective to improve the compatibility of an update by penalizing new errors. The objective offers full leverage of the performance/compatibility tradeoff across different datasets, enabling more compatible yet accurate updates.",

    "abstract": "Accuracy is an important concern for suppliers of artificial intelligence (AI) services, but considerations beyond accuracy, such as safety (which includes fairness and explainability), security, and provenance, are also critical elements to engender consumers’ trust in a service. Many industries use transparent, standardized, but often not legally required documents called supplier's declarations of conformity (SDoCs) to describe the lineage of a product along with the safety and performance testing it has undergone. SDoCs may be considered multidimensional fact sheets that capture and quantify various aspects of the product and its development to make it worthy of consumers’ trust. In this article, inspired by this practice, we propose FactSheets to help increase trust in AI services. We envision such documents to contain purpose, performance, safety, security, and provenance information to be completed by AI service providers for examination by consumers. We suggest a comprehensive set of declaration items tailored to AI in the Appendix of this article.",

    "title": "Towards a Roadmap on Software Engineering for Responsible AI",
    "abstract": "Although AI is transforming the world, there are serious concerns about its ability to behave and make decisions responsibly. Many ethical regulations, principles, and frameworks for responsible AI have been issued recently. However, they are high level and difficult to put into practice. On the other hand, most AI researchers focus on algorithmic solutions, while the responsible AI challenges actually crosscut the entire engineering lifecycle and components of AI systems. To close the gap in operationalizing responsible AI, this paper aims to develop a roadmap on software engineering for responsible AI. The roadmap focuses on (i) establishing multi-level governance for responsible AI systems, (ii) setting up the development processes incorporating process-oriented practices for responsible AI systems, and (iii) building responsible-AI-by-design into AI systems through system-level architectural style, patterns and techniques.

    "abstract": "Abstract Online misinformation has become a constant; only the way actors create and distribute that information is changing. Advances in artificial intelligence (AI) such as GPT-2 mean that actors can now synthetically generate text in ways that mimic the style and substance of human-created news stories. We carried out three original experiments to study whether these AI-generated texts are credible and can influence opinions on foreign policy. The first evaluated human perceptions of AI-generated text relative to an original story. The second investigated the interaction between partisanship and AI-generated news. The third examined the distributions of perceived credibility across different AI model sizes. We find that individuals are largely incapable of distinguishing between AI- and human-generated text; partisanship affects the perceived credibility of the story; and exposure to the text does little to change individuals’ policy views. The findings have important implications in understanding AI in online misinformation campaigns.",

    "abstract": "The development of AI applications is a multidisciplinary effort, involving multiple roles collaborating with the AI developers, an umbrella term we use to include data scientists and other AI-adjacent roles on the same team. During these collaborations, there is a knowledge mismatch between AI developers, who are skilled in data science, and external stakeholders who are typically not. This difference leads to communication gaps, and the onus falls on AI developers to explain data science concepts to their collaborators. In this paper, we report on a study including analyses of both interviews with AI developers and artifacts they produced for communication. Using the analytic lens of shared mental models, we report on the types of communication gaps that AI developers face, how AI developers communicate across disciplinary and organizational boundaries, and how they simultaneously manage issues regarding trust and expectations.",

    "title": "Demystifying AI: What Digital Transformation Leaders Can Teach You about Realistic Artificial Intelligence",
    "abstract": "Recent years have seen a reemergence of interest in artificial intelligence (AI) among both managers and academics. Driven by technological advances and public interest, AI is considered by some as an unprecedented revolutionary technology with the potential to transform humanity. But, at this stage, managers are left with little empirical advice on how to prepare and use AI in their firm’s operations. Based on case studies and the results of two global surveys among senior managers across industries, this article shows that AI is typically implemented and used with other advanced digital technologies in firms’ digital transformation projects. The digital transformation projects in which AI is deployed are mostly in support of firms’ existing businesses, thereby demystifying some of the transformative claims made about AI. This article then presents a framework for successfully implementing AI in the context of digital transformation, offering specific guidance in the areas of data, intelligence, being grounded, integrated, teaming, agility, and leadership.",

    "abstract": "AI technologies have been incorporated into many end-user applications. However, expectations of the capabilities of such systems vary among people. Furthermore, bloated expectations have been identified as negatively affecting perception and acceptance of such systems. Although the intelligibility of ML algorithms has been well studied, there has been little work on methods for setting appropriate expectations before the initial use of an AI-based system. In this work, we use a Scheduling Assistant - an AI system for automated meeting request detection in free-text email - to study the impact of several methods of expectation setting. We explore two versions of this system with the same 50% level of accuracy of the AI component but each designed with a different focus on the types of errors to avoid (avoiding False Positives vs. False Negatives). We show that such different focus can lead to vastly different subjective perceptions of accuracy and acceptance. Further, we design expectation adjustment techniques that prepare users for AI imperfections and result in a significant increase in acceptance.",

    "abstract": "To design and develop AI-based systems that users and the larger public can justifiably trust, one needs to understand how machine learning technologies impact trust. To guide the design and implementation of trusted AI-based systems, this paper provides a systematic approach to relate considerations about trust from the social sciences to trustworthiness technologies proposed for AI-based services and products. We start from the ABI+ (Ability, Benevolence, Integrity, Predictability) framework augmented with a recently proposed mapping of ABI+ on qualities of technologies that support trust. We consider four categories of trustworthiness technologies for machine learning, namely these for Fairness, Explainability, Auditability and Safety (FEAS) and discuss if and how these support the required qualities. Moreover, trust can be impacted throughout the life cycle of AI-based systems, and we therefore introduce the concept of Chain of Trust to discuss trustworthiness technologies in all stages of the life cycle. In so doing we establish the ways in which machine learning technologies support trusted AI-based systems. Finally, FEAS has obvious relations with known frameworks and therefore we relate FEAS to a variety of international 'principled AI' policy and technology frameworks that have emerged in recent years.",

    "title": "From a ‘race to AI’ to a ‘race to AI regulation’: regulatory competition for artificial intelligence",
    "abstract": "ABSTRACT Against a background of global competition to seize the opportunities promised by Artificial Intelligence (AI), many countries and regions are explicitly taking part in a ‘race to AI’. Yet the increased visibility of the technology’s risks has led to ever-louder calls for regulators to look beyond the benefits, and also secure appropriate regulation to ensure AI that is ‘trustworthy’ – i.e. legal, ethical and robust. Besides minimising risks, such regulation could facilitate AI’s uptake, boost legal certainty, and hence also contribute to advancing countries’ position in the race. Consequently, this paper argues that the ‘race to AI’ also brings forth a ‘race to AI regulation’. After discussing the regulatory toolbox for AI and some of the challenges that regulators face when making use thereof, this paper assesses to which extent regulatory competition for AI – or its counterpart, regulatory convergence – is a possibility, a reality and a desirability.",

    "title": "Blockchain and AI-Based Solutions to Combat Coronavirus (COVID-19)-Like Epidemics: A Survey",
    "abstract": "The beginning of 2020 has seen the emergence of coronavirus outbreak caused by a novel virus called SARS-CoV-2. The sudden explosion and uncontrolled worldwide spread of COVID-19 show the limitations of existing healthcare systems in timely handling public health emergencies. In such contexts, innovative technologies such as blockchain and Artificial Intelligence (AI) have emerged as promising solutions for fighting coronavirus epidemic. In particular, blockchain can combat pandemics by enabling early detection of outbreaks, ensuring the ordering of medical data, and ensuring reliable medical supply chain during the outbreak tracing. Moreover, AI provides intelligent solutions for identifying symptoms caused by coronavirus for treatments and supporting drug manufacturing. Therefore, we present an extensive survey on the use of blockchain and AI for combating COVID-19 epidemics. First, we introduce a new conceptual architecture which integrates blockchain and AI for fighting COVID-19. Then, we survey the latest research efforts on the use of blockchain and AI for fighting COVID-19 in various applications. The newly emerging projects and use cases enabled by these technologies to deal with coronavirus pandemic are also presented. A case study is also provided using federated AI for COVID-19 detection. Finally, we point out challenges and future directions that motivate more research efforts to deal with future coronavirus-like epidemics.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT As government and public administration lag behind the rapid development of AI in their efforts to provide adequate governance, they need respective concepts to keep pace with this dynamic progress. The literature provides few answers to the question of how government and public administration should respond to the great challenges associated with AI and use regulation to prevent harm. This study analyzes AI challenges and former AI regulation approaches. Based on this analysis and regulation theory, an integrated AI governance framework is developed that compiles key aspects of AI governance and provides a guide for the regulatory process of AI and its application. The article concludes with theoretical implications and recommendations for public officers.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this article is to determine the future proportion and variants of usage of human intellect and artificial intelligence (AI) in entrepreneurship of industry 4.0 that fits social entrepreneurship the most. It could be convergence (simultaneous utilization during the same entrepreneurial processes with the emphasis on unique features by the terms of the competition) or divergence (usage during different business processes by the terms of labor division).,The authors determine the influence of usage of human capital and AI on the efficiency of social entrepreneurship. The authors identify the perspective directions of usage of AI in social entrepreneurship and evaluate the readiness and interest in the implementation of these directions of concerned parties. The authors also model the optimal proportions and the variant of usage of human intellect and AI in social entrepreneurship in the conditions of Industry 4.0 in the future (until 2030).,It is found that social entrepreneurship will use the opportunities of Industry 4.0 for optimization of its activities until 2030, but will refuse from full automatization, using human intellect and AI at the same time.,The most perspective directions of application of AI at social companies are a collection of social goods and services, marketing studies and promotion of social goods and services. Neither convergence nor divergence of human and artificial intellectual capital does not fully conform to the interests of concerned parties. The most preferable (optimal) variant of usage of human intellect and AI in social entrepreneurship in the Industry 4.0 is human intelligent decision support.",

    "abstract": "We study the impact of AI on labor markets, using establishment level data on vacancies with detailed occupational information comprising the near-universe of online vacancies in the US from 2010 onwards. We classify establishments as “AI exposed” when their workers engage in tasks that are compatible with current AI capabilities. We document rapid growth in AI related vacancies over 2010-2018 that is not limited to the Professional and Business Services and Information Technology sectors and is significantly greater in AI-exposed establishments. AI-exposed establishments are differentially eliminating vacancy postings that list a range of previously-posted skills while simultaneously posting skill requirements that were not previously listed. Establishment-level estimates suggest that AI-exposed establishments are reducing hiring in non-AI positions even as they expand AI hiring. However, we find no discernible impact of AI exposure on employment or wages at the occupation or industry level, implying that AI is currently substituting for humans in a subset of tasks but it is not yet having detectable aggregate labor market consequences.",

In particular, some occupations and industries may do well while others experience labor market upheaval. We then consider current and potential policies around AI that may help to boost productivity growth while also mitigating any labor market downsides, including evaluating the pros and cons of an AI specific regulator, expanded antitrust enforcement, and alternative strategies for dealing with the labor market impacts of AI, including universal basic income and guaranteed employment.",

    "title": "Adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) for talent acquisition in IT/ITeS organizations",
    "abstract": "Human resource managers are adopting AI technology for conducting various tasks of human resource management, starting from manpower planning till employee exit. AI technology is prominently used for talent acquisition in organizations. This research investigates the adoption of AI technology for talent acquisition.,This study employs Technology-Organization-Environment (TOE) and Task-Technology-Fit (TTF) framework and proposes a model to explore the adoption of AI technology for talent acquisition. The survey was conducted among the 562 human resource managers and talent acquisition managers with a structured questionnaire. The analysis of data was completed using PLS-SEM.,This research reveals that cost-effectiveness, relative advantage, top management support, HR readiness, competitive pressure and support from AI vendors positively affect AI technology adoption for talent acquisition. Security and privacy issues negatively influence the adoption of AI technology. It is found that task and technology characteristics influence the task technology fit of AI technology for talent acquisition. Adoption and task technology fit of AI technology influence the actual usage of AI technology for talent acquisition. It is revealed that stickiness to traditional talent acquisition methods negatively moderates the association between adoption and actual usage of AI technology for talent acquisition. The proposed model was empirically validated and revealed the predictors of adoption and actual usage of AI technology for talent acquisition.,This paper provides the predictors of the adoption of AI technology for talent acquisition, which is emerging extensively in the human resource domain. It provides vital insights to the human resource managers to benchmark AI technology required for talent acquisition. Marketers can develop their marketing plan considering the factors of adoption. It would help designers to understand the factors of adoption and design the AI technology algorithms and applications for talent acquisition. It contributes to advance the literature of technology adoption by interweaving it with the human resource domain literature on talent acquisition.,This research uniquely validates the model for the adoption of AI technology for talent acquisition using the TOE and TTF framework. It reveals the factors influencing the adoption and actual usage of AI technology for talent acquisition.",

    "title": "My Teacher Is a Machine: Understanding Students’ Perceptions of AI Teaching Assistants in Online Education",
    "abstract": "ABSTRACT An increase in demand for online education has led to the creation of a new technology, machine teachers, or artificial intelligence (AI) teaching assistants. In fact, AI teaching assistants have already been implemented in a small number of courses in the United States. However, little is known about how students will perceive AI teaching assistants. Thus, the present study investigated students’ perceptions about AI teaching assistants in higher education by use of an online survey. Primary findings indicate that perceived usefulness of an AI teaching assistant and perceived ease of communication with an AI teaching assistant are key to understanding an eventual adoption of AI teaching assistant-based education. These findings provide support for AI teaching assistant adoption. Based on the present study’s findings, more research is needed to better understand the nuances associated with the learning experience one may have from an AI teaching assistant.",

    "abstract": "The performance of mobile AI accelerators has been evolving rapidly in the past two years, nearly doubling with each new generation of SoCs. The current 4th generation of mobile NPUs is already approaching the results of CUDA-compatible Nvidia graphics cards presented not long ago, which together with the increased capabilities of mobile deep learning frameworks makes it possible to run complex and deep AI models on mobile devices. In this paper, we evaluate the performance and compare the results of all chipsets from Qualcomm, HiSilicon, Samsung, MediaTek and Unisoc that are providing hardware acceleration for AI inference. We also discuss the recent changes in the Android ML pipeline and provide an overview of the deployment of deep learning models on mobile devices.

    "title": "A new generation of AI: A review and perspective on machine learning technologies applied to smart energy and electric power systems",
    "abstract": "The new generation of artificial intelligence (AI), called AI 2.0, has recently become a research focus. Data‐driven AI 2.0 will accelerate the development of smart energy and electric power system (Smart EEPS). In AI 2.0, machine learning (ML) forms a typical representative algorithm category used to achieve predictions and judgments by analyzing and learning from massive amounts of historical and synthetic data to help people make optimal decisions. ML has preliminarily been applied to the Smart Grid (SG) and Energy Internet (EI) fields, which are important Smart EEPS representatives. AI 2.0, especially ML, is undergoing a critical period of rapid development worldwide and will play an essential role in Smart EEPS. In this context, this study, combined with the emerging SG and EI technologies, takes the typical representative of AI 2.0—ML—as the research objective and reviews its research status in the operation, optimization, control, dispatching, and management of SG and EI. The paper focuses on introducing and summarizing the mainstream uses of seven representative ML methods, including reinforcement learning, deep learning, transfer learning, parallel learning, hybrid learning, adversarial learning, and ensemble learning, in the SG and EI fields. In this survey, we begin with an introduction to these seven types of ML methods and then systematically review their applications in Smart EEPS. Finally, we discuss ML development under the big data thinking and offer a prospect for the future development of AI 2.0 and ML in Smart EEPS. We conduct this survey intended to arouse the interest and excitement of experts and scholars in the EEPS industry and to look ahead to efforts that jointly promote the rapid development of AI 2.0 in the Smart EEPS field.",

    "title": "The Role and Limits of Principles in AI Ethics: Towards a Focus on Tensions",
    "abstract": "The last few years have seen a proliferation of principles for AI ethics. There is substantial overlap between different sets of principles, with widespread agreement that AI should be used for the common good, should not be used to harm people or undermine their rights, and should respect widely held values such as fairness, privacy, and autonomy. While articulating and agreeing on principles is important, it is only a starting point. Drawing on comparisons with the field of bioethics, we highlight some of the limitations of principles: in particular, they are often too broad and high-level to guide ethics in practice. We suggest that an important next step for the field of AI ethics is to focus on exploring the tensions that inevitably arise as we try to implement principles in practice. By explicitly recognising these tensions we can begin to make decisions about how they should be resolved in specific cases, and develop frameworks and guidelines for AI ethics that are rigorous and practically relevant. We discuss some different specific ways that tensions arise in AI ethics, and what processes might be needed to resolve them.",

    "abstract": "Ethics has powerful teeth, but these are barely being used in the ethics of AI today – it is no wonder the ethics of AI is then blamed for having no teeth. This article argues that ‘ethics’ in the current AI ethics field is largely ineffective, trapped in an ‘ethical principles’ approach and as such particularly prone to manipulation, especially by industry actors. Using ethics as a substitute for law risks its abuse and misuse. This significantly limits what ethics can achieve and is a great loss to the AI field and its impacts on individuals and society. This article discusses these risks and then highlights the teeth of ethics and the essential value they can – and should – bring to AI ethics now.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) is a rapidly growing technological phenomenon that all industries wish to exploit to benefit from efficiency gains and cost reductions. At the macrolevel, AI appears to be capable of replacing humans by undertaking intelligent tasks that were once limited to the human mind. However, another school of thought suggests that instead of being a replacement for the human mind, AI can be used for intelligence augmentation (IA). Accordingly, our research seeks to address these different views, their implications, and potential risks in an age of increased artificial awareness. We show that the ultimate goal of humankind is to achieve IA through the exploitation of AI. Moreover, we articulate the urgent need for ethical frameworks that define how AI should be used to trigger the next level of IA.",

    "abstract": "Artificial Intelligent (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) algorithms are coming out of research labs into the real-world applications, and recent research has focused a lot on Human-AI Interaction (HAI) and Explainable AI (XAI). However, Interaction is not the same as Collaboration. Collaboration involves mutual goal understanding, preemptive task co-management and shared progress tracking. Most of human activities today are done collaboratively, thus, to integrate AI into the already-complicated human workflow, it is critical to bring the Computer-Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW) perspective into the root of the algorithmic research and plan for a Human-AI Collaboration future of work. In this panel we ask: Can this future for trusted human-AI collaboration be realized? If so, what will it take? This panel will bring together HCI experts who work on human collaboration and AI applications in various application contexts, from industry and academia and from both the U.S. and China. Panelists will engage the audience through discussion of their shared and diverging visions, and through suggestions for opportunities and challenges for the future of human-AI collaboration.",

This expansion is driven by the principal AI strengths: automation, accuracy, and objectivity. However, as radiology AI matures to become fully integrated into the daily radiology routine, it needs to go beyond replicating static models, toward discovering new knowledge from the data and environments around it. Continuous learning AI presents the next substantial step in this direction and brings a new set of opportunities and challenges. Herein, the authors discuss the main concepts and requirements for implementing continuous AI in radiology and illustrate them with examples from emerging applications.",

    "abstract": "The hype surrounding AI has given rise to all kinds of speculations about the future of AI and indeed the future of what it is to be human. One popular idea, which is not only repeated often in the media and in the public discourse about AI but is also entertained by influential tech people who develop AI technology such as Elon Musk and Ray Kurzweil, is that of superintelligence and, more generally, the idea that machines will take over, will master us rather than the other way around. For some, this is a dream; for many, a nightmare. And for some, it is both at the same time.",

    "title": "Anthropomorphism in AI",
    "abstract": "Abstract AI research is growing rapidly raising various ethical issues related to safety, risks, and other effects widely discussed in the literature. We believe that in order to adequately address those issues and engage in a productive normative discussion it is necessary to examine key concepts and categories. One such category is anthropomorphism. It is a well-known fact that AI’s functionalities and innovations are often anthropomorphized (i.e., described and conceived as characterized by human traits). The general public’s anthropomorphic attitudes and some of their ethical consequences (particularly in the context of social robots and their interaction with humans) have been widely discussed in the literature. However, how anthropomorphism permeates AI research itself (i.e., in the very language of computer scientists, designers, and programmers), and what the epistemological and ethical consequences of this might be have received less attention. In this paper we explore this issue. We first set the methodological/theoretical stage, making a distinction between a normative and a conceptual approach to the issues. Next, after a brief analysis of anthropomorphism and its manifestations in the public, we explore its presence within AI research with a particular focus on brain-inspired AI. Finally, on the basis of our analysis, we identify some potential epistemological and ethical consequences of the use of anthropomorphic language and discourse within the AI research community, thus reinforcing the need of complementing the practical with a conceptual analysis.",

The paper is motivated by a corpus analysis of NIPS, ACL, COGSCI, and ICCV/ECCV paper titles showing differences in how work on explainable AI is positioned in various fields. We close by introducing a fourth notion: truly explainable systems, where automated reasoning is central to output crafted explanations without requiring human post processing as final step of the generative process.",

    "title": "Accountability of AI Under the Law: The Role of Explanation",
    "abstract": "The ubiquity of systems using artificial intelligence or \"AI\" has brought increasing attention to how those systems should be regulated. The choice of how to regulate AI systems will require care. AI systems have the potential to synthesize large amounts of data, allowing for greater levels of personalization and precision than ever before|applications range from clinical decision support to autonomous driving and predictive policing. That said, common sense reasoning [McCarthy, 1960] remains one of the holy grails of AI, and there exist legitimate concerns about the intentional and unintentional negative consequences of AI systems [Bostrom, 2003, Amodei et al., 2016, Sculley et al., 2014]. \n \nThere are many ways to hold AI systems accountable. In this work, we focus on one: explanation. Questions about a legal right to explanation from AI systems was recently debated in the EU General Data Protection Regulation [Goodman and Flaxman, 2016, Wachter et al., 2017], and thus thinking carefully about when and how explanation from AI systems might improve accountability is timely. Good choices about when to demand explanation can help prevent negative consequences from AI systems, while poor choices may not only fail to hold AI systems accountable but also hamper the development of much-needed beneficial AI systems. \n \nBelow, we briefly review current societal, moral, and legal norms around explanation, and then focus on the different contexts under which explanation is currently required under the law. We find that there exists great variation around when explanation is demanded, but there also exists important consistencies: when demanding explanation from humans, what we typically want to know is how and whether certain input factors affected the final decision or outcome. \n \nThese consistencies allow us to list the technical considerations that must be considered if we desired AI systems that could provide kinds of explanations that are currently required of humans under the law. Contrary to popular wisdom of AI systems as indecipherable black boxes, we find that this level of explanation should often be technically feasible but may sometimes be practically onerous|there are certain aspects of explanation that may be simple for humans to provide but challenging for AI systems, and vice versa. As an interdisciplinary team of legal scholars, computer scientists, and cognitive scientists, we recommend that for the present, AI systems can and should be held to a similar standard of explanation as humans currently are; in the future we may wish to hold an AI to a different standard.",

    "title": "Designing fair AI for managing employees in organizations: a review, critique, and design agenda",
    "abstract": "ABSTRACT Organizations are rapidly deploying artificial intelligence (AI) systems to manage their workers. However, AI has been found at times to be unfair to workers. Unfairness toward workers has been associated with decreased worker effort and increased worker turnover. To avoid such problems, AI systems must be designed to support fairness and redress instances of unfairness. Despite the attention related to AI unfairness, there has not been a theoretical and systematic approach to developing a design agenda. This paper addresses the issue in three ways. First, we introduce the organizational justice theory, three different fairness types (distributive, procedural, interactional), and the frameworks for redressing instances of unfairness (retributive justice, restorative justice). Second, we review the design literature that specifically focuses on issues of AI fairness in organizations. Third, we propose a design agenda for AI fairness in organizations that applies each of the fairness types to organizational scenarios. Then, the paper concludes with implications for future research.",

Explainable AI (XAI) now refers to the core backup for industry to apply AI in products at scale, particularly for industries operating with critical systems.

    "title": "Designing educational technologies in the age of AI: A learning sciences-driven approach",
    "abstract": "Interdisciplinary research from the learning sciences has helped us understand a great deal about the way that humans learn, and as a result we now have an improved understanding about how best to teach and train people. This same body of research must now be used to better inform the development of Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies for use in education and training. In this paper, we use three case studies to illustrate how learning sciences research can inform the judicious analysis, of rich, varied and multimodal data, so that it can be used to help us scaffold students and support teachers. Based on this increased understanding of how best to inform the analysis of data through the application of learning sciences research, we are better placed to design AI algorithms that can analyse rich educational data at speed. Such AI algorithms and technology can then help us to leverage faster, more nuanced and individualised scaffolding for learners. However, most commercial AI developers know little about learning sciences research, indeed they often know little about learning or teaching. We therefore argue that in order to ensure that AI technologies for use in education and training embody such judicious analysis and learn in a learning sciences informed manner, we must develop inter‐stakeholder partnerships between AI developers, educators and researchers. Here, we exemplify our approach to such partnerships through the EDUCATE Educational Technology (EdTech) programme. Practitioner NotesWhat is already known about this topic? The progress of AI Technology and learning analytics lags behind the adoption of these approaches and technologies in other fields such as medicine or finance.Data are central to the empirical work conducted in the learning sciences and to the development of machine learning Artificial Intelligence (AI).Education is full of doubts about the value that any technology can bring to the teaching and learning process.What this paper adds? We argue that the learning sciences have an important role to play in the design of educational AI, through their provision of theories that can be operationalised and advanced.Through case studies, we illustrate that the analysis of data appropriately informed by interdisciplinary learning sciences research can be used to power AI educational technology.We provide a framework for inter‐stakeholder, interdisciplinary partnerships that can help educators better understand AI, and AI developers better understand education.Implications for practice and/or policy? AI is here to stay and that it will have an increasing impact on the design of technology for use in education and training.Data, which is the power behind machine learning AI, can enable analysis that can vastly increase our understanding of when and how the teaching and learning process is progressing positively.Inter‐stakeholder, interdisciplinary partnerships must be used to make sure that AI provides some of the educational benefits its application in other areas promise us.

    "title": "Explainable AI: Beware of Inmates Running the Asylum Or: How I Learnt to Stop Worrying and Love the Social and Behavioural Sciences",
    "abstract": "In his seminal book `The Inmates are Running the Asylum: Why High-Tech Products Drive Us Crazy And How To Restore The Sanity' [2004, Sams Indianapolis, IN, USA], Alan Cooper argues that a major reason why software is often poorly designed (from a user perspective) is that programmers are in charge of design decisions, rather than interaction designers. As a result, programmers design software for themselves, rather than for their target audience, a phenomenon he refers to as the `inmates running the asylum'. This paper argues that explainable AI risks a similar fate. While the re-emergence of explainable AI is positive, this paper argues most of us as AI researchers are building explanatory agents for ourselves, rather than for the intended users. But explainable AI is more likely to succeed if researchers and practitioners understand, adopt, implement, and improve models from the vast and valuable bodies of research in philosophy, psychology, and cognitive science, and if evaluation of these models is focused more on people than on technology. From a light scan of literature, we demonstrate that there is considerable scope to infuse more results from the social and behavioural sciences into explainable AI, and present some key results from these fields that are relevant to explainable AI.",

    "abstract": "This study examines tourists’ attitudes toward the use of artificially intelligent (AI) devices in either relatively more utilitarian or hedonic tourism services (airline and hospitality services, respectively). Findings suggest that tourists’ acceptance of the use of AI devices in both service contexts is influenced by social influence, hedonic motivation, anthropomorphism, performance and effort expectancy, and emotions toward the artificially intelligent devices. Findings further suggest that social influence is a stronger determinant in hospitality services compared to airline services. Tourists have higher performance expectancy from AI devices used to provide airline services compared to hospitality services. Tourists’ willingness to accept the use of AI devices for delivering hospitality services is lower than airline services. These results suggest that while the utilization of AI devices for delivering functional services is acceptable, the use of AI devices in the delivery of hedonic services may backfire.",

    "title": "AI in Health: State of the Art, Challenges, and Future Directions",
    "abstract": "Summary Introduction: Artificial intelligence (AI) technologies continue to attract interest from a broad range of disciplines in recent years, including health. The increase in computer hardware and software applications in medicine, as well as digitization of health-related data together fuel progress in the development and use of AI in medicine. This progress provides new opportunities and challenges, as well as directions for the future of AI in health. Objective: The goals of this survey are to review the current state of AI in health, along with opportunities, challenges, and practical implications. This review highlights recent developments over the past five years and directions for the future. Methods: Publications over the past five years reporting the use of AI in health in clinical and biomedical informatics journals, as well as computer science conferences, were selected according to Google Scholar citations. Publications were then categorized into five different classes, according to the type of data analyzed. Results: The major data types identified were multi-omics, clinical, behavioral, environmental and pharmaceutical research and development (R&D) data. The current state of AI related to each data type is described, followed by associated challenges and practical implications that have emerged over the last several years. Opportunities and future directions based on these advances are discussed. Conclusion: Technologies have enabled the development of AI-assisted approaches to healthcare. However, there remain challenges. Work is currently underway to address multi-modal data integration, balancing quantitative algorithm performance and qualitative model interpretability, protection of model security, federated learning, and model bias.",

    "abstract": "\nPurpose\nThe purpose of this paper is to explain the technological phenomenon artificial intelligence (AI) and how it can contribute to knowledge-based marketing in B2B. Specifically, this paper describes the foundational building blocks of any artificial intelligence system and their interrelationships. This paper also discusses the implications of the different building blocks with respect to market knowledge in B2B marketing and outlines avenues for future research.\n\n\nDesign/methodology/approach\nThe paper is conceptual and proposes a framework to explicate the phenomenon AI and its building blocks. It further provides a structured discussion of how AI can contribute to different types of market knowledge critical for B2B marketing: customer knowledge, user knowledge and external market knowledge.\n\n\nFindings\nThe paper explains AI from an input–processes–output lens and explicates the six foundational building blocks of any AI system. It also discussed how the combination of the building blocks transforms data into information and knowledge.\n\n\nPractical implications\nAimed at general marketing executives, rather than AI specialists, this paper explains the phenomenon artificial intelligence, how it works and its relevance for the knowledge-based marketing in B2B firms. The paper highlights illustrative use cases to show how AI can impact B2B marketing functions.\n\n\nOriginality/value\nThe study conceptualizes the technological phenomenon artificial intelligence from a knowledge management perspective and contributes to the literature on knowledge management in the era of big data. It addresses calls for more scholarly research on AI and B2B marketing.\n",

    "title": "Envisioning Communities: A Participatory Approach Towards AI for Social Good",
    "abstract": "Research in artificial intelligence (AI) for social good presupposes some definition of social good, but potential definitions have been seldom suggested and never agreed upon. The normative question of what AI for social good research should be \"for\" is not thoughtfully elaborated, or is frequently addressed with a utilitarian outlook that prioritizes the needs of the majority over those who have been historically marginalized, brushing aside realities of injustice and inequity. We argue that AI for social good ought to be assessed by the communities that the AI system will impact, using as a guide the capabilities approach, a framework to measure the ability of different policies to improve human welfare equity. Furthermore, we lay out how AI research has the potential to catalyze social progress by expanding and equalizing capabilities. We show how the capabilities approach aligns with a participatory approach for the design and implementation of AI for social good research in a framework we introduce called PACT, in which community members affected should be brought in as partners and their input prioritized throughout the project. We conclude by providing an incomplete set of guiding questions for carrying out such participatory AI research in a way that elicits and respects a community's own definition of social good.",

    "abstract": "We observed how 102 children (7-12 years old), from four different countries (U.S.A, Germany, Denmark, and Sweden), imagine smart devices and toys of the future and how they perceive current AI technologies. Children outside of U.S.A were overall more critical of these technologies and less exposed to them. The way children collaborated and communicated while describing their AI perception and expectations were influenced both by their social-economical and cultural background. Children in low and medium SES schools and centers were better are collaborating compared to high SES children, but had a harder time advancing because they had less experience with coding and interacting with these technologies. Children in high SES schools and centers had troubles collaborating initially but displayed a stronger understanding of AI concepts. Based on our initial findings we propose a series of guidelines for designing future hands-on learning activities with smart toys and AI devices for K8 students.",

    "title": "Translational AI and Deep Learning in Diagnostic Pathology",
    "abstract": "There has been an exponential growth in the application of AI in health and in pathology. This is resulting in the innovation of deep learning technologies that are specifically aimed at cellular imaging and practical applications that could transform diagnostic pathology. This paper reviews the different approaches to deep learning in pathology, the public grand challenges that have driven this innovation and a range of emerging applications in pathology. The translation of AI into clinical practice will require applications to be embedded seamlessly within digital pathology workflows, driving an integrated approach to diagnostics and providing pathologists with new tools that accelerate workflow and improve diagnostic consistency and reduce errors. The clearance of digital pathology for primary diagnosis in the US by some manufacturers provides the platform on which to deliver practical AI. AI and computational pathology will continue to mature as researchers, clinicians, industry, regulatory organizations and patient advocacy groups work together to innovate and deliver new technologies to health care providers: technologies which are better, faster, cheaper, more precise, and safe.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) is expected to revolutionise the practice of medicine. Recent advancements in the field of deep learning have demonstrated success in variety of clinical tasks: detecting diabetic retinopathy from images, predicting hospital readmissions, aiding in the discovery of new drugs, etc. AI’s progress in medicine, however, has led to concerns regarding the potential effects of this technology on relationships of trust in clinical practice. In this paper, I will argue that there is merit to these concerns, since AI systems can be relied on, and are capable of reliability, but cannot be trusted, and are not capable of trustworthiness. Insofar as patients are required to rely on AI systems for their medical decision-making, there is potential for this to produce a deficit of trust in relationships in clinical practice.",

    "title": "From Machine Learning to Explainable AI",
    "abstract": "The success of statistical machine learning (ML) methods made the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI) so popular again, after the last AI winter. Meanwhile deep learning approaches even exceed human performance in particular tasks. However, such approaches have some disadvantages besides of needing big quality data, much computational power and engineering effort; those approaches are becoming increasingly opaque, and even if we understand the underlying mathematical principles of such models they still lack explicit declarative knowledge. For example, words are mapped to high-dimensional vectors, making them unintelligible to humans. What we need in the future are context-adaptive procedures, i.e. systems that construct contextual explanatory models for classes of real-world phenomena. This is the goal of explainable AI, which is not a new field; rather, the problem of explainability is as old as AI itself. While rule-based approaches of early AI were comprehensible “glass-box” approaches at least in narrow domains, their weakness was in dealing with uncertainties of the real world. Maybe one step further is in linking probabilistic learning methods with large knowledge representations (ontologies) and logical approaches, thus making results re-traceable, explainable and comprehensible on demand.",

    "abstract": "Even as public pressure mounts for technology companies to consider societal impacts of products, industries and governments in the AI race are demanding technical talent. To meet this demand, universities clamor to add technical artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) courses into computing curriculum-but how are societal and ethical considerations part of this landscape? We explore two pathways for ethics content in AI education: (1) standalone AI ethics courses, and (2) integrating ethics into technical AI courses. For both pathways, we ask: What is being taught? As we train computer scientists who will build and deploy AI tools, how are we training them to consider the consequences of their work? In this exploratory work, we qualitatively analyzed 31 standalone AI ethics classes from 22 U.S. universities and 20 AI/ML technical courses from 12 U.S. universities to understand which ethics-related topics instructors include in courses. We identify and categorize topics in AI ethics education, share notable practices, and note omissions. Our analysis will help AI educators identify what topics should be taught and create scaffolding for developing future AI ethics education.",

    "title": "Do Humans Trust Advice More if it Comes from AI?: An Analysis of Human-AI Interactions",
    "abstract": "In decision support applications of AI, the AI algorithm's output is framed as a suggestion to a human user. The user may ignore this advice or take it into consideration to modify their decision. With the increasing prevalence of such human-AI interactions, it is important to understand how users react to AI advice. In this paper, we recruited over 1100 crowdworkers to characterize how humans use AI suggestions relative to equivalent suggestions from a group of peer humans across several experimental settings. We find that participants' beliefs about how human versus AI performance on a given task affects whether they heed the advice. When participants do heed the advice, they use it similarly for human and AI suggestions. Based on these results, we propose a two-stage, \"activation-integration\" model for human behavior and use it to characterize the factors that affect human-AI interactions.",

AI technologies won't replace human workers but augment their capabilities, with smart machines to work alongside smart people. AI can automate structured and repetitive work; provide extensive analysis of data through machine learning (?analytics on steroids?), and engage with customers and employees via chatbots and intelligent agents. Companies should experiment with these technologies and develop their own expertise.Davenport describes the major AI technologies and explains how they are being used, reports on the AI work done by large commercial enterprises like Amazon and Google, and outlines strategies and steps to becoming a cognitive corporation.

Our study takes a first look at the potential impact of AI-MC on online self-presentation. In three experiments we test whether people find Airbnb hosts less trustworthy if they believe their profiles have been written by AI. We observe a new phenomenon that we term the Replicant Effect: Only when participants thought they saw a mixed set of AI- and human-written profiles, they mistrusted hosts whose profiles were labeled as or suspected to be written by AI. Our findings have implications for the design of systems that involve AI technologies in online self-presentation and chart a direction for future work that may upend or augment key aspects of Computer-Mediated Communication theory.",

    "title": "Designing for human-AI complementarity in K-12 education",
    "abstract": "Recent work has explored how complementary strengths of humans and artificial intelligence (AI) systems might be productively combined. However, successful forms of human-AI partnership have rarely been demonstrated in real-world settings. We present the iterative design and evaluation of Lumilo, smart glasses that help teachers help their students in AI-supported classrooms by presenting real-time analytics about students' learning, metacognition, and behavior. Results from a field study conducted in K-12 classrooms indicate that students learn more when teachers and AI tutors work together during class. We discuss implications of this research for the design of human-AI partnerships. We argue for more participatory approaches to research and design in this area, in which practitioners and other stakeholders are deeply, meaningfully involved throughout the process. Furthermore, we advocate for theory-building and for principled approaches to the study of human-AI decision-making in real-world contexts.",

Method: A narrative review of existing research and evaluation approaches along with expert perspectives drawn from the International Medical Informatics Association (IMIA) Working Group on Technology Assessment and Quality Development in Health Informatics and the European Federation for Medical Informatics (EFMI) Working Group for Assessment of Health Information Systems. Results: There is a rich history and tradition of evaluating AI in healthcare. While evaluators can learn from past efforts, and build on best practice evaluation frameworks and methodologies, questions remain about how to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of AI that dynamically harness vast amounts of genomic, biomarker, phenotype, electronic record, and care delivery data from across health systems. This paper first provides a historical perspective about the evaluation of AI in healthcare. It then examines key challenges of evaluating AI-enabled clinical decision support during design, development, selection, use, and ongoing surveillance. Practical aspects of evaluating AI in healthcare, including approaches to evaluation and indicators to monitor AI are also discussed. Conclusion: Commitment to rigorous initial and ongoing evaluation will be critical to ensuring the safe and effective integration of AI in complex sociotechnical settings.

    "title": "Managing Bias in AI",
    "abstract": "Recent awareness of the impacts of bias in AI algorithms raises the risk for companies to deploy such algorithms, especially because the algorithms may not be explainable in the same way that non-AI algorithms are. Even with careful review of the algorithms and data sets, it may not be possible to delete all unwanted bias, particularly because AI systems learn from historical data, which encodes historical biases. In this paper, we propose a set of processes that companies can use to mitigate and manage three general classes of bias: those related to mapping the business intent into the AI implementation, those that arise due to the distribution of samples used for training, and those that are present in individual input samples. While there may be no simple or complete solution to this issue, best practices can be used to reduce the effects of bias on algorithmic outcomes.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT Introduction: Various factors are driving interest in the application of artificial intelligence (AI) for breast cancer (BC) detection, but it is unclear whether the evidence warrants large-scale use in population-based screening. Areas covered: We performed a scoping review, a structured evidence synthesis describing a broad research field, to summarize knowledge on AI evaluated for BC detection and to assess AI’s readiness for adoption in BC screening. Studies were predominantly small retrospective studies based on highly selected image datasets that contained a high proportion of cancers (median BC proportion in datasets 26.5%), and used heterogeneous techniques to develop AI models; the range of estimated AUC (area under ROC curve) for AI models was 69.2–97.8% (median AUC 88.2%). We identified various methodologic limitations including use of non-representative imaging data for model training, limited validation in external datasets, potential bias in training data, and few comparative data for AI versus radiologists’ interpretation of mammography screening. Expert opinion: Although contemporary AI models have reported generally good accuracy for BC detection, methodological concerns, and evidence gaps exist that limit translation into clinical BC screening settings. These should be addressed in parallel to advancing AI techniques to render AI transferable to large-scale population-based screening.",

    "abstract": "Recent increases in computing power, coupled with rapid growth in the availability and quantity of data have rekindled our interest in the theory and applications of artificial intelligence (AI). However, for AI to be confidently rolled out by industries and governments, users want greater transparency through explainable AI (XAI) systems. The author introduces XAI concepts, and gives an overview of areas in need of further exploration—such as type-2 fuzzy logic systems—to ensure such systems can be fully understood and analyzed by the lay user.",

    "abstract": "Machine learning advances have afforded an increase in algorithms capable of creating art, music, stories, games, and more. However, it is not yet well-understood how machine learning algorithms might best collaborate with people to support creative expression. To investigate how practicing designers perceive the role of AI in the creative process, we developed a game level design tool for Super Mario Bros.-style games with a built-in AI level designer. In this paper we discuss our design of the Morai Maker intelligent tool through two mixed-methods studies with a total of over one-hundred participants. Our findings are as follows: (1) level designers vary in their desired interactions with, and role of, the AI, (2) the AI prompted the level designers to alter their design practices, and (3) the level designers perceived the AI as having potential value in their design practice, varying based on their desired role for the AI.",

    "title": "\"Scary Robots\": Examining Public Responses to AI",
    "abstract": "How AI is perceived by the public can have significant impact on how it is developed, deployed and regulated. Some commentators argue that perceptions are currently distorted or extreme. This paper discusses the results of a nationally representative survey of the UK population on their perceptions of AI. The survey solicited responses to eight common narratives about AI (four optimistic, four pessimistic), plus views on what AI is, how likely it is to impact in respondents' lifetimes, and whether they can influence it. 42% of respondents offered a plausible definition of AI, while 25% thought it meant robots. Of the narratives presented, those associated with automation were best known, followed by the idea that AI would become more powerful than humans. Overall results showed that the most common visions of the impact of AI elicit significant anxiety. Only two of the eight narratives elicited more excitement than concern (AI making life easier, and extending life). Respondents felt they had no control over AI's development, citing the power of corporations or government, or versions of technological determinism. Negotiating the deployment of AI will require contending with these anxieties.",

    "title": "Enabling AI in Future Wireless Networks: A Data Life Cycle Perspective",
    "abstract": "Recent years have seen rapid deployment of mobile computing and Internet of Things (IoT) networks, which can be mostly attributed to the increasing communication and sensing capabilities of wireless systems. Big data analysis, pervasive computing, and eventually artificial intelligence (AI) are envisaged to be deployed on top of the IoT and create a new world featured by data-driven AI. In this context, a novel paradigm of merging AI and wireless communications, called Wireless AI that pushes AI frontiers to the network edge, is widely regarded as a key enabler for future intelligent network evolution. To this end, we present a comprehensive survey of the latest studies in wireless AI from the data-driven perspective. Specifically, we first propose a novel Wireless AI architecture that covers five key data-driven AI themes in wireless networks, including Sensing AI, Network Device AI, Access AI, User Device AI and Data-provenance AI. Then, for each data-driven AI theme, we present an overview on the use of AI approaches to solve the emerging data-related problems and show how AI can empower wireless network functionalities. Particularly, compared to the other related survey papers, we provide an in-depth discussion on the Wireless AI applications in various data-driven domains wherein AI proves extremely useful for wireless network design and optimization. Finally, research challenges and future visions are also discussed to spur further research in this promising area.",

These problems include safe interruptibility, avoiding side effects, absent supervisor, reward gaming, safe exploration, as well as robustness to self-modification, distributional shift, and adversaries. To measure compliance with the intended safe behavior, we equip each environment with a performance function that is hidden from the agent. This allows us to categorize AI safety problems into robustness and specification problems, depending on whether the performance function corresponds to the observed reward function. We evaluate A2C and Rainbow, two recent deep reinforcement learning agents, on our environments and show that they are not able to solve them satisfactorily.",

    "title": "Explainable AI in Industry",
    "abstract": "Artificial Intelligence is increasingly playing an integral role in determining our day-to-day experiences. Moreover, with proliferation of AI based solutions in areas such as hiring, lending, criminal justice, healthcare, and education, the resulting personal and professional implications of AI are far-reaching. The dominant role played by AI models in these domains has led to a growing concern regarding potential bias in these models, and a demand for model transparency and interpretability. In addition, model explainability is a prerequisite for building trust and adoption of AI systems in high stakes domains requiring reliability and safety such as healthcare and automated transportation, and critical industrial applications with significant economic implications such as predictive maintenance, exploration of natural resources, and climate change modeling. As a consequence, AI researchers and practitioners have focused their attention on explainable AI to help them better trust and understand models at scale. The challenges for the research community include (i) defining model explainability, (ii) formulating explainability tasks for understanding model behavior and developing solutions for these tasks, and finally (iii) designing measures for evaluating the performance of models in explainability tasks. In this tutorial, we will present an overview of model interpretability and explainability in AI, key regulations/laws, and techniques/tools for providing explainability as part of AI/ML systems. Then, we will focus on the application of explainability techniques in industry, wherein we present practical challenges/ guidelines for using explainability techniques effectively and lessons learned from deploying explainable models for several web-scale machine learning and data mining applications. We will present case studies across different companies, spanning application domains such as search and recommendation systems, sales, lending, and fraud detection. Finally, based on our experiences in industry, we will identify open problems and research directions for the data mining/machine learning community.",

    "title": "Increasing Trust in AI Services through Supplier's Declarations of Conformity",
    "abstract": "The accuracy and reliability of machine learning algorithms are an important concern for suppliers of artificial intelligence (AI) services, but considerations beyond accuracy, such as safety, security, and provenance, are also critical elements to engender consumers' trust in a service. In this paper, we propose a supplier's declaration of conformity (SDoC) for AI services to help increase trust in AI services. An SDoC is a transparent, standardized, but often not legally required, document used in many industries and sectors to describe the lineage of a product along with the safety and performance testing it has undergone. We envision an SDoC for AI services to contain purpose, performance, safety, security, and provenance information to be completed and voluntarily released by AI service providers for examination by consumers. Importantly, it conveys product-level rather than component-level functional testing. We suggest a set of declaration items tailored to AI and provide examples for two fictitious AI services.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this article is to draw attention to an aspect of intelligence that has not yet received significant attention from the AI community, but that plays a crucial role in a technology’s effectiveness in the world, namely teaming intelligence. We propose that Al will reach its full potential only if, as part of its intelligence, it also has enough teaming intelligence to work well with people. Although seemingly counterintuitive, the more intelligent the technological system, the greater the need for collaborative skills. This paper will argue why teaming intelligence is important to AI, provide a general structure for AI researchers to use in developing intelligent systems that team well, assess the current state of the art and, in doing so, suggest a path forward for future AI systems. This is not a call to develop a new capability, but rather, an approach to what AI capabilities should be built, and how, so as to imbue intelligent systems with teaming competence.",

    "abstract": "\nPurpose\nThe purpose of this study is to explore the current use of artificial intelligence (AI) in the recruitment and selection of candidates. More specifically, this research investigates the level, rate and potential adoption areas for AI-tools across the hiring process.\n\n\nDesign/methodology/approach\nTo fulfill that purpose, a two-step approach was adopted. First, the literature was extensively reviewed to identify potential AI-application areas supporting the recruitment and selection (R&S) process. Second, primary research was carried out in the form of semi-structured thematic interviews with different types of R&S specialists including HR managers, consultants and academics to evaluate how much of the AI-applications areas identified in the literature review are being used in practice.\n\n\nFindings\nThis study presents a multitude of findings. First, it identifies 11 areas across the R&S Process where AI-applications can be applied. However, practitioners currently seem to rely mostly on three: chatbots, screening software and task automation tools. Second, most companies adopting these AI-tools tend to be larger, tech-focussed and/or innovative firms. Finally, despite the exponential rate of AI-adoption, companies have yet to reach an inflection point as they currently show reluctance to invest in that technology for R&S.\n\n\nResearch limitations/implications\nDue to the qualitative and exploratory nature behind the research, this study displays a significant amount of subjectivity, and therefore, lacks generalisability. Despite this limitation, this study opens the door to many opportunities for academic research, both qualitative and quantitative.\n\n\nOriginality/value\nThis paper addresses the huge research gap surrounding AI in R&S, pertaining specifically to the scarcity and poor quality of the current academic literature. Furthermore, this research provides a comprehensive overview of the state of AI in R&S, which will be helpful for academics and practitioners looking to rapidly gain a holistic understanding of AI in R&S.\n",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly being developed for use in medicine, including for diagnosis and in treatment decision making. The use of AI in medical treatment raises many ethical issues that are yet to be explored in depth by bioethicists. In this paper, I focus specifically on the relationship between the ethical ideal of shared decision making and AI systems that generate treatment recommendations, using the example of IBM’s Watson for Oncology. I argue that use of this type of system creates both important risks and significant opportunities for promoting shared decision making. If value judgements are fixed and covert in AI systems, then we risk a shift back to more paternalistic medical care. However, if designed and used in an ethically informed way, AI could offer a potentially powerful way of supporting shared decision making. It could be used to incorporate explicit value reflection, promoting patient autonomy. In the context of medical treatment, we need value-flexible AI that can both respond to the values and treatment goals of individual patients and support clinicians to engage in shared decision making.",

    "abstract": "With the increasing commoditization of computer vision, speech recognition and machine translation systems and the widespread deployment of learning-based back-end technologies such as digital advertising and intelligent infrastructures, AI (Artificial Intelligence) has moved from research labs to production. These changes have been made possible by unprecedented levels of data and computation, by methodological advances in machine learning, by innovations in systems software and architectures, and by the broad accessibility of these technologies. \nThe next generation of AI systems promises to accelerate these developments and increasingly impact our lives via frequent interactions and making (often mission-critical) decisions on our behalf, often in highly personalized contexts. Realizing this promise, however, raises daunting challenges. In particular, we need AI systems that make timely and safe decisions in unpredictable environments, that are robust against sophisticated adversaries, and that can process ever increasing amounts of data across organizations and individuals without compromising confidentiality. These challenges will be exacerbated by the end of the Moore's Law, which will constrain the amount of data these technologies can store and process. In this paper, we propose several open research directions in systems, architectures, and security that can address these challenges and help unlock AI's potential to improve lives and society.",

    "title": "Scaling learning algorithms towards AI",
    "abstract": "One long-term goal of machine learning research is to produce methods that are applicable to highly complex tasks, such as perception (vision, audition), reasoning, intelligent control, and other artificially intelligent behaviors. We argue that in order to progress toward this goal, the Machine Learning community must endeavor to discover algorithms that can learn highly complex functions, with minimal need for prior knowledge, and with minimal human intervention. We present mathematical and empirical evidence suggesting that many popular approaches to non-parametric learning, particularly kernel methods, are fundamentally limited in their ability to learn complex high-dimensional functions. Our analysis focuses on two problems. First, kernel machines are shallow architectures, in which one large layer of simple template matchers is followed by a single layer of trainable coefficients. We argue that shallow architectures can be very inefficient in terms of required number of computational elements and examples. Second, we analyze a limitation of kernel machines with a local kernel, linked to the curse of dimensionality, that applies to supervised, unsupervised (manifold learning) and semi-supervised kernel machines. Using empirical results on invariant image recognition tasks, kernel methods are compared with deep architectures, in which lower-level features or concepts are progressively combined into more abstract and higher-level representations. We argue that deep architectures have the potential to generalize in non-local ways, i.e., beyond immediate neighbors, and that this is crucial in order to make progress on the kind of complex tasks required for artificial intelligence.",

    "title": "A Year in K-12 AI Education",
    "abstract": "The time is ripe to consider what 21st-century digital citizens should know about artificial intelligence (AI). Efforts are under way in the USA, China, and many other countries to promote AI education in kindergarten through high school (K–12). The past year has seen the release of new curricula and online resources for the K–12 audience, and new professional development opportunities for K–12 teachers to learn the basics of AI. This column surveys the current state of K–12 AI education and introduces the work of the AI4K12 Initiative, which is developing national guidelines for AI education in the USA. \n  \nA Note to the Reader \nThis is the inaugural column on AI education. It aims to inform the AAAI community of current and future developments in AI education. We hope that the reader finds the columns to be informative and that they stimulate debate. It is our fond hope that this and subsequent columns inspire the reader to get involved in the broad field of AI education, by volunteering their expertise in their local school district, by providing level-headed input when discussing AI with family and friends or by lending their considerable expertise to various decision makers. We welcome your feedback, whether in the form of a response to an article or a suggestion for a future article. \n– Michael Wollowski, AI in Education Column Editor \n ",

    "title": "Defining AI in Policy versus Practice",
    "abstract": "Recent concern about harms of information technologies motivate consideration of regulatory action to forestall or constrain certain developments in the field of artificial intelligence (AI). However, definitional ambiguity hampers the possibility of conversation about this urgent topic of public concern. Legal and regulatory interventions require agreed-upon definitions, but consensus around a definition of AI has been elusive, especially in policy conversations. With an eye towards practical working definitions and a broader understanding of positions on these issues, we survey experts and review published policy documents to examine researcher and policy-maker conceptions of AI. We find that while AI researchers favor definitions of AI that emphasize technical functionality, policy-makers instead use definitions that compare systems to human thinking and behavior. We point out that definitions adhering closely to the functionality of AI systems are more inclusive of technologies in use today, whereas definitions that emphasize human-like capabilities are most applicable to hypothetical future technologies. As a result of this gap, ethical and regulatory efforts may overemphasize concern about future technologies at the expense of pressing issues with existing deployed technologies.",

    "title": "AI Anxiety",
    "abstract": "Recently a number of well‐known public figures have expressed concern about the future development of artificial intelligence (AI), by noting that AI could get out of control and affect human beings and society in disastrous ways. Many of these cautionary notes are alarmist and unrealistic, and while there has been some pushback on these concerns, the deep flaws in the thinking that leads to them have not been called out. Much of the fear and trepidation is based on misunderstanding and confusion about what AI is and can ever be. In this work we identify 3 factors that contribute to this “AI anxiety”: an exclusive focus on AI programs that leaves humans out of the picture, confusion about autonomy in computational entities and in humans, and an inaccurate conception of technological development. With this analysis we argue that there are good reasons for anxiety about AI but not for the reasons typically given by AI alarmists.",

    "abstract": "Humans and AI systems are usually portrayed as separate systems that we need to align in values and goals. However, there is a great deal of AI technology found in non-autonomous systems that are used as cognitive tools by humans. Under the extended mind thesis, the functional contributions of these tools become as essential to our cognition as our brains. But AI can take cognitive extension towards totally new capabilities, posing new philosophical, ethical and technical challenges. To analyse these challenges better, we define and place AI extenders in a continuum between fully-externalized systems, loosely coupled with humans, and fully internalized processes, with operations ultimately performed by the brain, making the tool redundant. We dissect the landscape of cognitive capabilities that can foreseeably be extended by AI and examine their ethical implications.We suggest that cognitive extenders using AI be treated as distinct from other cognitive enhancers by all relevant stakeholders, including developers, policy makers, and human users.",

    "abstract": "\n \n \nFrom its inception, artificial intelligence (AI) has had a rather ambivalent relationship to humans — swinging between their augmentation and their replacement. Now, as AI technologies enter our everyday lives at an ever-increasing pace, there is a greater need for AI systems to work synergistically with humans. To do this effectively, AI systems must pay more attention to aspects of intelligence that help humans work with each other — including social intelligence. I will discuss the research challenges in designing such human-aware AI systems, including modeling the mental states of humans-in-the-loop and recognizing their desires and intentions, providing proactive support, exhibiting explicable behavior, giving cogent explanations on demand, and engendering trust. I will survey the progress made so far on these challenges, and highlight some promising directions. I will also touch on the additional ethical quandaries that such systems pose. I will end by arguing that the quest for human-aware AI systems broadens the scope of AI enterprise; necessitates and facilitates true interdisciplinary collaborations; and can go a long way toward increasing public acceptance of AI technologies. \n \n \n",

    "abstract": "We suggest that the analysis of incomplete contracting developed by law and economics researchers can provide a useful framework for understanding the AI alignment problem and help to generate a systematic approach to finding solutions. We first provide an overview of the incomplete contracting literature and explore parallels between this work and the problem of AI alignment. As we emphasize, misalignment between principal and agent is a core focus of economic analysis. We highlight some technical results from the economics literature on incomplete contracts that may provide insights for AI alignment researchers. Our core contribution, however, is to bring to bear an insight that economists have been urged to absorb from legal scholars and other behavioral scientists: the fact that human contracting is supported by substantial amounts of external structure, such as generally available institutions (culture, law) that can supply implied terms to fill the gaps in incomplete contracts. We propose a research agenda for AI alignment work that focuses on the problem of how to build AI that can replicate the human cognitive processes that connect individual incomplete contracts with this supporting external structure.",

    "title": "An AI Race for Strategic Advantage: Rhetoric and Risks",
    "abstract": "The rhetoric of the race for strategic advantage is increasingly being used with regard to the development of artificial intelligence (AI), sometimes in a military context, but also more broadly. This rhetoric also reflects real shifts in strategy, as industry research groups compete for a limited pool of talented researchers, and nation states such as China announce ambitious goals for global leadership in AI. This paper assesses the potential risks of the AI race narrative and of an actual competitive race to develop AI, such as incentivising corner-cutting on safe-ty and governance, or increasing the risk of conflict. It explores the role of the research community in respond-ing to these risks. And it briefly explores alternative ways in which the rush to develop powerful AI could be framed so as instead to foster collaboration and respon-sible progress.",

    "abstract": "Given the well-known limitations of the Turing Test, there is a need for objective tests to both focus attention on, and measure progress towards, the goals of AI. In this paper we argue that machine performance on standardized tests should be a key component of any new measure of AI, because attaining a high level of performance requires solving significant AI problems involving language understanding and world modeling - critical skills for any machine that lays claim to intelligence. In addition, standardized tests have all the basic requirements of a practical test: they are accessible, easily comprehensible, clearly measurable, and offer a graduated progression from simple tasks to those requiring deep understanding of the world. Here we propose this task as a challenge problem for the community, summarize our state-of-the-art results on math and science tests, and provide supporting datasets",

    "abstract": "From the Publisher: \nThis text covers all the material needed to understand the principles behind the AI approach to robotics and to program an artificially intelligent robot for applications involving sensing, navigation, planning, and uncertainty. Robin Murphy is extremely effective at combining theoretical and practical rigor with a light narrative touch. In the overview, for example, she touches upon anthropomorphic robots from classic films and science fiction stories before delving into the nuts and bolts of organizing intelligence in robots. \nFollowing the overview, Murphy contrasts AI and engineering approaches and discusses what she calls the three paradigms of AI robotics: hierarchical, reactive, and hybrid deliberative/reactive. Later chapters explore multiagent scenarios, navigation and path-planning for mobile robots, and the basics of computer vision and range sensing. Each chapter includes objectives, review questions, and exercises. Many chapters contain one or more case studies showing how the concepts were implemented on real robots. Murphy, who is well known for her classroom teaching, conveys the intellectual adventure of mastering complex theoretical and technical material.",

    "abstract": "In fall 2014, we launched a foundational course in artificial intelligence (CS7637: Knowledge-Based AI) as part of the Georgia Institute of Technology's Online Master of Science in Computer Science program. We incorporated principles and practices from the cognitive and learning sciences into the development of the online AI course. We also integrated AI techniques into the instruction of the course, including embedding 100 highly focused intelligent tutoring agents in the video lessons. By now, more than 2000 students have taken the course. Evaluations have indicated that OMSCS students enjoy the course compared to traditional courses, and more importantly, that online students have matched residential students' performance on the same assessments. In this article, we present the design, delivery, and evaluation of the course, focusing on the use of AI for teaching AI. We also discuss lessons we learned for scaling the teaching and learning of AI.",

    "title": "AI-2-mediated signalling in bacteria.",
    "abstract": "Success in nature depends upon an ability to perceive and adapt to the surrounding environment. Bacteria are not an exception; they recognize and constantly adjust to changing situations by sensing environmental and self-produced signals, altering gene expression accordingly. Autoinducer-2 (AI-2) is a signal molecule produced by LuxS, an enzyme found in many bacterial species and thus proposed to enable interspecies communication. Two classes of AI-2 receptors and many layers and interactions involved in downstream signalling have been identified so far. Although AI-2 has been implicated in the regulation of numerous niche-specific behaviours across the bacterial kingdom, interpretation of these results is complicated by the dual role of LuxS in signalling and the activated methyl cycle, a crucial central metabolic pathway. In this article, we present a comprehensive review of the discovery and early characterization of AI-2, current developments in signal detection, transduction and regulation, and the major studies investigating the phenotypes regulated by this molecule. The development of novel tools should help to resolve many of the remaining questions in the field; we highlight how these advances might be exploited in AI-2 quorum quenching, treatment of diseases, and the manipulation of beneficial behaviours caused by polyspecies communities.",

It finds that the main areas of current academic research are in tactical and strategic decision-making, plan recognition, and learning, and it outlines the research contributions in each of these areas. The paper then contrasts the use of game AI in academia and industry, finding the academic research heavily focused on creating game-winning agents, while the indus- try aims to maximise player enjoyment. It finds the industry adoption of academic research is low because it is either in- applicable or too time-consuming and risky to implement in a new game, which highlights an area for potential investi- gation: bridging the gap between academia and industry. Fi- nally, the areas of spatial reasoning, multi-scale AI, and co- operation are found to require future work, and standardised evaluation methods are proposed to produce comparable re- sults between studies.",

Artificial intelligence (AI) technologies are used in many components of CiteSeerX e.g. to accurately extract metadata, intelligently crawl the web, and ingest documents. We present key AI technologies used in the following components: document classification and deduplication, document and citation clustering, automatic metadata extraction and indexing, and author disambiguation. These AI technologies have been developed by CiteSeerX group members over the past 5–6 years. We also show the usage status, payoff, development challenges, main design concepts, and deployment and maintenance requirements.

    "abstract": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) is increasingly adopted within HRM and other business domains as it has the potential to create value for the both the employees and organisations. However, recent studies have found that organisations are yet to experience the anticipated benefits from AI adoption, despite investing time, effort, and resources. The existing studies in Human Resource management (HRM) have looked at the applications of AI, anticipated benefits, and impact at both organizational and employee levels. Our aim is to systematically review multi-disciplinary literature stemming from International Business, Information Management, Operations Management, General Management and HRM to provide a comprehensive and holistic understanding of organisational resources required for organisations to develop AI capability. Our findings show that organisations need to think beyond technical resources, and focus on developing non-technical ones such as human skills and competencies, leadership, team co-ordination, organisational culture and innovation mindset, governance strategy, and most importantly AI-employee integration strategy. Based on these findings, we contribute five research positions to advance AI scholarship in HRM. Theoretically, we unearth, why complementary organisational resources and not just technical infrastructure are essential to achieve organisationally valued outcomes. Furthermore, our proposed framework offers a systematic way for the managers to self-assess organisational readiness to adopt and implement AI-enabled solutions in HRM.",

    "title": "Game AI revisited",
    "abstract": "More than a decade after the early research efforts on the use of artificial intelligence (AI) in computer games and the establishment of a new AI domain the term ``game AI'' needs to be redefined. Traditionally, the tasks associated with game AI revolved around non player character (NPC) behavior at different levels of control, varying from navigation and pathfinding to decision making. Commercial-standard games developed over the last 15 years and current game productions, however, suggest that the traditional challenges of game AI have been well addressed via the use of sophisticated AI approaches, not necessarily following or inspired by advances in academic practices. The marginal penetration of traditional academic game AI methods in industrial productions has been mainly due to the lack of constructive communication between academia and industry in the early days of academic game AI, and the inability of academic game AI to propose methods that would significantly advance existing development processes or provide scalable solutions to real world problems. Recently, however, there has been a shift of research focus as the current plethora of AI uses in games is breaking the non-player character AI tradition. A number of those alternative AI uses have already shown a significant potential for the design of better games.\n This paper presents four key game AI research areas that are currently reshaping the research roadmap in the game AI field and evidently put the game AI term under a new perspective. These game AI flagship research areas include the computational modeling of player experience, the procedural generation of content, the mining of player data on massive-scale and the alternative AI research foci for enhancing NPC capabilities.",

    "title": "A Survey of Large Language Models",
    "abstract": "Language is essentially a complex, intricate system of human expressions governed by grammatical rules. It poses a significant challenge to develop capable AI algorithms for comprehending and grasping a language. As a major approach, language modeling has been widely studied for language understanding and generation in the past two decades, evolving from statistical language models to neural language models. Recently, pre-trained language models (PLMs) have been proposed by pre-training Transformer models over large-scale corpora, showing strong capabilities in solving various NLP tasks. Since researchers have found that model scaling can lead to performance improvement, they further study the scaling effect by increasing the model size to an even larger size. Interestingly, when the parameter scale exceeds a certain level, these enlarged language models not only achieve a significant performance improvement but also show some special abilities that are not present in small-scale language models. To discriminate the difference in parameter scale, the research community has coined the term large language models (LLM) for the PLMs of significant size. Recently, the research on LLMs has been largely advanced by both academia and industry, and a remarkable progress is the launch of ChatGPT, which has attracted widespread attention from society. The technical evolution of LLMs has been making an important impact on the entire AI community, which would revolutionize the way how we develop and use AI algorithms. In this survey, we review the recent advances of LLMs by introducing the background, key findings, and mainstream techniques. In particular, we focus on four major aspects of LLMs, namely pre-training, adaptation tuning, utilization, and capacity evaluation. Besides, we also summarize the available resources for developing LLMs and discuss the remaining issues for future directions.",

    "title": "The Rise and Potential of Large Language Model Based Agents: A Survey",
    "abstract": "For a long time, humanity has pursued artificial intelligence (AI) equivalent to or surpassing the human level, with AI agents considered a promising vehicle for this pursuit. AI agents are artificial entities that sense their environment, make decisions, and take actions. Many efforts have been made to develop intelligent agents, but they mainly focus on advancement in algorithms or training strategies to enhance specific capabilities or performance on particular tasks. Actually, what the community lacks is a general and powerful model to serve as a starting point for designing AI agents that can adapt to diverse scenarios. Due to the versatile capabilities they demonstrate, large language models (LLMs) are regarded as potential sparks for Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), offering hope for building general AI agents. Many researchers have leveraged LLMs as the foundation to build AI agents and have achieved significant progress. In this paper, we perform a comprehensive survey on LLM-based agents. We start by tracing the concept of agents from its philosophical origins to its development in AI, and explain why LLMs are suitable foundations for agents. Building upon this, we present a general framework for LLM-based agents, comprising three main components: brain, perception, and action, and the framework can be tailored for different applications. Subsequently, we explore the extensive applications of LLM-based agents in three aspects: single-agent scenarios, multi-agent scenarios, and human-agent cooperation. Following this, we delve into agent societies, exploring the behavior and personality of LLM-based agents, the social phenomena that emerge from an agent society, and the insights they offer for human society. Finally, we discuss several key topics and open problems within the field. A repository for the related papers at https://github.com/WooooDyy/LLM-Agent-Paper-List.",

    "title": "Application of nanogenerators in acoustics based on artificial intelligence and machine learning",
    "abstract": "As artificial intelligence (AI) advances, it is critical to give conventional electronics the capacity to “think,” “analyze,” and “advise.” The need for intelligent, self-powered devices has increased due to recent significant developments in the computer field, namely, in the fields of AI and machine learning (ML). The use of nanogenerators in the area of acoustics is examined in this Review, with an emphasis on how they might be integrated with ML and AI. Innovative energy-harvesting devices called nanogenerators are able to produce electrical power from outside sources, such as vibrations in the air or mechanical movements. The study examines a number of acoustic applications for nanogenerators, such as energy harvesting, sound detection, noise monitoring, and acoustic sensing. Furthermore, the research highlights how AI and ML techniques enhance the performance of nanogenerators and enable more efficient acoustic applications through data analysis and model training. At the end of this Review, the future development prospects of nanogenerators based on AI and ML were discussed.",

These two characteristics hamper the goal of establishing challenging game AI. In this paper, we put forward Monte-Carlo Tree Search as a novel, unified framework to game AI. In the framework, randomized explorations of the search space are used to predict the most promising game actions. We will demonstrate that Monte-Carlo Tree Search can be applied effectively to (1) classic board-games, (2) modern board-games, and (3) video games.",

    "abstract": "Massive data corpora like WebText, Wikipedia, Conceptual Captions, WebImageText, and LAION have propelled recent dramatic progress in AI. Large neural models trained on such datasets produce impressive results and top many of today's benchmarks. A notable omisslion within this family of large-scale datasets is 3D data. Despite considerable interest and potential applications in 3D vision, datasets of high-fidelity 3D models continue to be mid-sized with limited diversity of object categories. Addressing this gap, we present Objaverse 1.0, a large dataset of objects with 800K + (and growing) 3D models with descriptive captions, tags, and animations. Objaverse improves upon present day 3D repositories in terms of scale, number of categories, and in the visual diversity of instances within a category. We demonstrate the large potential of Objaverse via four diverse applications: training generative 3D models, improving tail category segmentation on the LVIS benchmark, training open-vocabulary object-navigation models for Embodied AI, and creating a new benchmark for robustness analysis of vision models. Objaverse can open new directions for research and enable new applications across the field of AI.",

    "title": "Representation Learning: A Review and New Perspectives",
    "abstract": "The success of machine learning algorithms generally depends on data representation, and we hypothesize that this is because different representations can entangle and hide more or less the different explanatory factors of variation behind the data. Although specific domain knowledge can be used to help design representations, learning with generic priors can also be used, and the quest for AI is motivating the design of more powerful representation-learning algorithms implementing such priors. This paper reviews recent work in the area of unsupervised feature learning and deep learning, covering advances in probabilistic models, autoencoders, manifold learning, and deep networks. This motivates longer term unanswered questions about the appropriate objectives for learning good representations, for computing representations (i.e., inference), and the geometrical connections between representation learning, density estimation, and manifold learning.",

    "title": "Human-Level AI's Killer Application: Interactive Computer Games",
    "abstract": "� Although one of the fundamental goals of AI is to understand and develop intelligent systems that have all the capabilities of humans, there is little active research directly pursuing this goal. We propose that AI for interactive computer games is an emerging application area in which this goal of human-level AI can successfully be pursued. Interactive computer games have increasingly complex and realistic worlds and increasingly complex and intelligent computer-controlled characters. In this article, we further motivate our proposal of using interactive computer games for AI research, review previous research on AI and games, and present the different game genres and the roles that human-level AI could play within these genres. We then describe the research issues and AI techniques that are relevant to each of these roles. Our conclusion is that interactive computer games provide a rich environment for incremental research on human-level AI.",

    "abstract": "In this article we introduce the Arcade Learning Environment (ALE): both a challenge problem and a platform and methodology for evaluating the development of general, domain-independent AI technology. ALE provides an interface to hundreds of Atari 2600 game environments, each one different, interesting, and designed to be a challenge for human players. ALE presents significant research challenges for reinforcement learning, model learning, model-based planning, imitation learning, transfer learning, and intrinsic motivation. Most importantly, it provides a rigorous testbed for evaluating and comparing approaches to these problems. We illustrate the promise of ALE by developing and benchmarking domain-independent agents designed using well-established AI techniques for both reinforcement learning and planning. In doing so, we also propose an evaluation methodology made possible by ALE, reporting empirical results on over 55 different games. All of the software, including the benchmark agents, is publicly available.",

    "abstract": "Humans have a remarkable capability to perform a wide variety of physical and mental tasks without any measurements and any computations. Familar examples are: parking a car, driving in city traffic, playing golf, cooking a meal, and summarizing a story. In performing such tasks, humans employ perceptions of time, direction, speed, shape, possibility, likelihood, truth, and other attributes of physical and mental objects. Reflecting the bounded ability of the human brain to resolve detail, perceptions are intrinsically imprecise. In more concrete terms, perceptions are f-granular, meaning that (a) the boundaries of perceived classes are unsharp; and (b) the values of attributes are granulated, with a granule being a clump of values (points, objects) drawn together by indistinguishability, similarity, proximity, and functionality. For example, the granules of age might be labeled very young, young, middle-age, old, very old, etc.",

    "abstract": "The paper presents a review, of the developments in the field of diagnosis of electrical machines and drives based on artificial intelligence (AI). This review covers the application of expert systems, neural networks and fuzzy logic systems that can be integrated into each other and also with more traditional techniques to overcome specific problems. Usually a diagnostic procedure starts from a fault tree developed on the basis of the physical behaviour of the electrical system under consideration. In this phase the knowledge of well tested models able to simulate the electrical machine in different fault renditions is fundamental to obtain the patterns characterising the faults. Then the fault tree navigation performed by an expert system inference engine leads to the choice of suitable diagnostic indexes, referred to a particular fault, and relevant to build an input dataset for specific AI (neural networks, fuzzy logic or neuro-fuzzy) systems. The discussed methodologies, that play a general role in the diagnostic field, are applied to an induction machine, utilising as input signals the instantaneous voltages and currents. In addition, the supply converter is also considered to also incorporate in the diagnostic procedure the most typical failures of power electronic components. A brief description of the various techniques is provided, to highlight the advantages and the validity limits of using AI technologies. Some application examples are discussed and areas for future research are also indicated.",

    "abstract": "At the dawn of the fourth industrial revolution, we are witnessing a fast and widespread adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) in our daily life, which contributes to accelerating the shift towards a more algorithmic society. However, even with such unprecedented advancements, a key impediment to the use of AI-based systems is that they often lack transparency. Indeed, the black-box nature of these systems allows powerful predictions, but it cannot be directly explained. This issue has triggered a new debate on explainable AI (XAI). A research field holds substantial promise for improving trust and transparency of AI-based systems. It is recognized as the sine qua non for AI to continue making steady progress without disruption. This survey provides an entry point for interested researchers and practitioners to learn key aspects of the young and rapidly growing body of research related to XAI. Through the lens of the literature, we review the existing approaches regarding the topic, discuss trends surrounding its sphere, and present major research trajectories.",

    "title": "Probabilistic reasoning in intelligent systems - networks of plausible inference",
    "abstract": "From the Publisher: \nProbabilistic Reasoning in Intelligent Systems is a complete andaccessible account of the theoretical foundations and computational methods that underlie plausible reasoning under uncertainty. The author provides a coherent explication of probability as a language for reasoning with partial belief and offers a unifying perspective on other AI approaches to uncertainty, such as the Dempster-Shafer formalism, truth maintenance systems, and nonmonotonic logic. The author distinguishes syntactic and semantic approaches to uncertaintyand offers techniques, based on belief networks, that provide a mechanism for making semantics-based systems operational. Specifically, network-propagation techniques serve as a mechanism for combining the theoretical coherence of probability theory with modern demands of reasoning-systems technology: modular declarative inputs, conceptually meaningful inferences, and parallel distributed computation. Application areas include diagnosis, forecasting, image interpretation, multi-sensor fusion, decision support systems, plan recognition, planning, speech recognitionin short, almost every task requiring that conclusions be drawn from uncertain clues and incomplete information. \nProbabilistic Reasoning in Intelligent Systems will be of special interest to scholars and researchers in AI, decision theory, statistics, logic, philosophy, cognitive psychology, and the management sciences. Professionals in the areas of knowledge-based systems, operations research, engineering, and statistics will find theoretical and computational tools of immediate practical use. The book can also be used as an excellent text for graduate-level courses in AI, operations research, or applied probability.",

    "title": "Regulation of Uptake and Processing of the Quorum-Sensing Autoinducer AI-2 in Escherichia coli",
    "abstract": "ABSTRACT AI-2 is a quorum-sensing signaling molecule proposed to be involved in interspecies communication. In Escherichia coli and Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, extracellular AI-2 accumulates in exponential phase, but the amount decreases drastically upon entry into stationary phase. In S. enterica serovar Typhimurium, the reduction in activity is due to import and processing of AI-2 by the Lsr transporter. We show that the Lsr transporter is functional in E. coli, and screening for mutants defective in AI-2 internalization revealed lsrK and glpD. Unlike the wild type, lsrK and glpD mutants do not activate transcription of the lsr operon in response to AI-2. lsrK encodes the AI-2 kinase, and the lsrK mutant fails to activate lsr expression because it cannot produce phospho-AI-2, which is the lsr operon inducer. glpD encodes the glycerol-3-phosphate (G3P) dehydrogenase, which is involved in glycerol and G3P metabolism. G3P accumulates in the glpD mutant and represses lsr transcription by preventing cyclic AMP (cAMP)-catabolite activator protein (CAP)-dependent activation. Dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) also accumulates in the glpD mutant, and DHAP represses lsr transcription by a cAMP-CAP-independent mechanism involving LsrR, the lsr operon repressor. The requirement for cAMP-CAP in lsr activation explains why AI-2 persists in culture fluids of bacteria grown in media containing sugars that cause catabolite repression. These findings show that, depending on the prevailing growth conditions, the amount of time that the AI-2 signal is present and, in turn, the time that a given community of bacteria remains exposed to this signal can vary greatly.",

    "title": "A Survey on Bias and Fairness in Machine Learning",
    "abstract": "With the widespread use of artificial intelligence (AI) systems and applications in our everyday lives, accounting for fairness has gained significant importance in designing and engineering of such systems. AI systems can be used in many sensitive environments to make important and life-changing decisions; thus, it is crucial to ensure that these decisions do not reflect discriminatory behavior toward certain groups or populations. More recently some work has been developed in traditional machine learning and deep learning that address such challenges in different subdomains. With the commercialization of these systems, researchers are becoming more aware of the biases that these applications can contain and are attempting to address them. In this survey, we investigated different real-world applications that have shown biases in various ways, and we listed different sources of biases that can affect AI applications. We then created a taxonomy for fairness definitions that machine learning researchers have defined to avoid the existing bias in AI systems. In addition to that, we examined different domains and subdomains in AI showing what researchers have observed with regard to unfair outcomes in the state-of-the-art methods and ways they have tried to address them. There are still many future directions and solutions that can be taken to mitigate the problem of bias in AI systems. We are hoping that this survey will motivate researchers to tackle these issues in the near future by observing existing work in their respective fields.",

    "title": "Efficient Processing of Deep Neural Networks: A Tutorial and Survey",
    "abstract": "Deep neural networks (DNNs) are currently widely used for many artificial intelligence (AI) applications including computer vision, speech recognition, and robotics. While DNNs deliver state-of-the-art accuracy on many AI tasks, it comes at the cost of high computational complexity. Accordingly, techniques that enable efficient processing of DNNs to improve energy efficiency and throughput without sacrificing application accuracy or increasing hardware cost are critical to the wide deployment of DNNs in AI systems. This article aims to provide a comprehensive tutorial and survey about the recent advances toward the goal of enabling efficient processing of DNNs. Specifically, it will provide an overview of DNNs, discuss various hardware platforms and architectures that support DNNs, and highlight key trends in reducing the computation cost of DNNs either solely via hardware design changes or via joint hardware design and DNN algorithm changes. It will also summarize various development resources that enable researchers and practitioners to quickly get started in this field, and highlight important benchmarking metrics and design considerations that should be used for evaluating the rapidly growing number of DNN hardware designs, optionally including algorithmic codesigns, being proposed in academia and industry. The reader will take away the following concepts from this article: understand the key design considerations for DNNs; be able to evaluate different DNN hardware implementations with benchmarks and comparison metrics; understand the tradeoffs between various hardware architectures and platforms; be able to evaluate the utility of various DNN design techniques for efficient processing; and understand recent implementation trends and opportunities.",

    "title": "Relational inductive biases, deep learning, and graph networks",
    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) has undergone a renaissance recently, making major progress in key domains such as vision, language, control, and decision-making. This has been due, in part, to cheap data and cheap compute resources, which have fit the natural strengths of deep learning. However, many defining characteristics of human intelligence, which developed under much different pressures, remain out of reach for current approaches. In particular, generalizing beyond one's experiences--a hallmark of human intelligence from infancy--remains a formidable challenge for modern AI. \nThe following is part position paper, part review, and part unification. We argue that combinatorial generalization must be a top priority for AI to achieve human-like abilities, and that structured representations and computations are key to realizing this objective. Just as biology uses nature and nurture cooperatively, we reject the false choice between \"hand-engineering\" and \"end-to-end\" learning, and instead advocate for an approach which benefits from their complementary strengths. We explore how using relational inductive biases within deep learning architectures can facilitate learning about entities, relations, and rules for composing them. We present a new building block for the AI toolkit with a strong relational inductive bias--the graph network--which generalizes and extends various approaches for neural networks that operate on graphs, and provides a straightforward interface for manipulating structured knowledge and producing structured behaviors. We discuss how graph networks can support relational reasoning and combinatorial generalization, laying the foundation for more sophisticated, interpretable, and flexible patterns of reasoning. As a companion to this paper, we have released an open-source software library for building graph networks, with demonstrations of how to use them in practice.",

    "title": "Artificial Intelligence in Service",
    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly reshaping service by performing various tasks, constituting a major source of innovation, yet threatening human jobs. We develop a theory of AI job replacement to address this double-edged impact. The theory specifies four intelligences required for service tasks—mechanical, analytical, intuitive, and empathetic—and lays out the way firms should decide between humans and machines for accomplishing those tasks. AI is developing in a predictable order, with mechanical mostly preceding analytical, analytical mostly preceding intuitive, and intuitive mostly preceding empathetic intelligence. The theory asserts that AI job replacement occurs fundamentally at the task level, rather than the job level, and for “lower” (easier for AI) intelligence tasks first. AI first replaces some of a service job’s tasks, a transition stage seen as augmentation, and then progresses to replace human labor entirely when it has the ability to take over all of a job’s tasks. The progression of AI task replacement from lower to higher intelligences results in predictable shifts over time in the relative importance of the intelligences for service employees. An important implication from our theory is that analytical skills will become less important, as AI takes over more analytical tasks, giving the “softer” intuitive and empathetic skills even more importance for service employees. Eventually, AI will be capable of performing even the intuitive and empathetic tasks, which enables innovative ways of human–machine integration for providing service but also results in a fundamental threat for human employment.",

    "title": "Decision-Theoretic Planning: Structural Assumptions and Computational Leverage",
    "abstract": "Planning under uncertainty is a central problem in the study of automated sequential decision making, and has been addressed by researchers in many different fields, including AI planning, decision analysis, operations research, control theory and economics. While the assumptions and perspectives adopted in these areas often differ in substantial ways, many planning problems of interest to researchers in these fields can be modeled as Markov decision processes (MDPs) and analyzed using the techniques of decision theory. This paper presents an overview and synthesis of MDP-related methods, showing how they provide a unifying framework for modeling many classes of planning problems studied in AI. It also describes structural properties of MDPs that, when exhibited by particular classes of problems, can be exploited in the construction of optimal or approximately optimal policies or plans. Planning problems commonly possess structure in the reward and value functions used to describe performance criteria, in the functions used to describe state transitions and observations, and in the relationships among features used to describe states, actions, rewards, and observations. Specialized representations, and algorithms employing these representations, can achieve computational leverage by exploiting these various forms of structure. Certain AI techniques -- in particular those based on the use of structured, intensional representations -- can be viewed in this way. This paper surveys several types of representations for both classical and decision-theoretic planning problems, and planning algorithms that exploit these representations in a number of different ways to ease the computational burden of constructing policies or plans. It focuses primarily on abstraction, aggregation and decomposition techniques based on AI-style representations.",

    "title": "Edge Intelligence: Paving the Last Mile of Artificial Intelligence With Edge Computing",
    "abstract": "With the breakthroughs in deep learning, the recent years have witnessed a booming of artificial intelligence (AI) applications and services, spanning from personal assistant to recommendation systems to video/audio surveillance. More recently, with the proliferation of mobile computing and Internet of Things (IoT), billions of mobile and IoT devices are connected to the Internet, generating zillions bytes of data at the network edge. Driving by this trend, there is an urgent need to push the AI frontiers to the network edge so as to fully unleash the potential of the edge big data. To meet this demand, edge computing, an emerging paradigm that pushes computing tasks and services from the network core to the network edge, has been widely recognized as a promising solution. The resulted new interdiscipline, edge AI or edge intelligence (EI), is beginning to receive a tremendous amount of interest. However, research on EI is still in its infancy stage, and a dedicated venue for exchanging the recent advances of EI is highly desired by both the computer system and AI communities. To this end, we conduct a comprehensive survey of the recent research efforts on EI. Specifically, we first review the background and motivation for AI running at the network edge. We then provide an overview of the overarching architectures, frameworks, and emerging key technologies for deep learning model toward training/inference at the network edge. Finally, we discuss future research opportunities on EI. We believe that this survey will elicit escalating attentions, stimulate fruitful discussions, and inspire further research ideas on EI.",

    "title": "Review of Artificial Intelligence Techniques in Imaging Data Acquisition, Segmentation, and Diagnosis for COVID-19",
    "abstract": "The pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is spreading all over the world. Medical imaging such as X-ray and computed tomography (CT) plays an essential role in the global fight against COVID-19, whereas the recently emerging artificial intelligence (AI) technologies further strengthen the power of the imaging tools and help medical specialists. We hereby review the rapid responses in the community of medical imaging (empowered by AI) toward COVID-19. For example, AI-empowered image acquisition can significantly help automate the scanning procedure and also reshape the workflow with minimal contact to patients, providing the best protection to the imaging technicians. Also, AI can improve work efficiency by accurate delineation of infections in X-ray and CT images, facilitating subsequent quantification. Moreover, the computer-aided platforms help radiologists make clinical decisions, i.e., for disease diagnosis, tracking, and prognosis. In this review paper, we thus cover the entire pipeline of medical imaging and analysis techniques involved with COVID-19, including image acquisition, segmentation, diagnosis, and follow-up. We particularly focus on the integration of AI with X-ray and CT, both of which are widely used in the frontline hospitals, in order to depict the latest progress of medical imaging and radiology fighting against COVID-19.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to assess the impact of Artificial Intelligence (AI) on education. Premised on a narrative and framework for assessing AI identified from a preliminary analysis, the scope of the study was limited to the application and effects of AI in administration, instruction, and learning. A qualitative research approach, leveraging the use of literature review as a research design and approach was used and effectively facilitated the realization of the study purpose. Artificial intelligence is a field of study and the resulting innovations and developments that have culminated in computers, machines, and other artifacts having human-like intelligence characterized by cognitive abilities, learning, adaptability, and decision-making capabilities. The study ascertained that AI has extensively been adopted and used in education, particularly by education institutions, in different forms. AI initially took the form of computer and computer related technologies, transitioning to web-based and online intelligent education systems, and ultimately with the use of embedded computer systems, together with other technologies, the use of humanoid robots and web-based chatbots to perform instructors’ duties and functions independently or with instructors. Using these platforms, instructors have been able to perform different administrative functions, such as reviewing and grading students’ assignments more effectively and efficiently, and achieve higher quality in their teaching activities. On the other hand, because the systems leverage machine learning and adaptability, curriculum and content has been customized and personalized in line with students’ needs, which has fostered uptake and retention, thereby improving learners experience and overall quality of learning.",

    "title": "A Review of the Role of Artificial Intelligence in Healthcare",
    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) applications have transformed healthcare. This study is based on a general literature review uncovering the role of AI in healthcare and focuses on the following key aspects: (i) medical imaging and diagnostics, (ii) virtual patient care, (iii) medical research and drug discovery, (iv) patient engagement and compliance, (v) rehabilitation, and (vi) other administrative applications. The impact of AI is observed in detecting clinical conditions in medical imaging and diagnostic services, controlling the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) with early diagnosis, providing virtual patient care using AI-powered tools, managing electronic health records, augmenting patient engagement and compliance with the treatment plan, reducing the administrative workload of healthcare professionals (HCPs), discovering new drugs and vaccines, spotting medical prescription errors, extensive data storage and analysis, and technology-assisted rehabilitation. Nevertheless, this science pitch meets several technical, ethical, and social challenges, including privacy, safety, the right to decide and try, costs, information and consent, access, and efficacy, while integrating AI into healthcare. The governance of AI applications is crucial for patient safety and accountability and for raising HCPs’ belief in enhancing acceptance and boosting significant health consequences. Effective governance is a prerequisite to precisely address regulatory, ethical, and trust issues while advancing the acceptance and implementation of AI. Since COVID-19 hit the global health system, the concept of AI has created a revolution in healthcare, and such an uprising could be another step forward to meet future healthcare needs.",

    "title": "Relationship of MRI delayed contrast enhancement to irreversible injury, infarct age, and contractile function.",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nContrast MRI enhancement patterns in several pathophysiologies resulting from ischemic myocardial injury are controversial or have not been investigated. We compared contrast enhancement in acute infarction (AI), after severe but reversible ischemic injury (RII), and in chronic infarction.\n\n\nMETHODS AND RESULTS\nIn dogs, a large coronary artery was occluded to study AI and/or chronic infarction (n = 18), and a second coronary artery was chronically instrumented with a reversible hydraulic occluder and Doppler flowmeter to study RII (n = 8). At 3 days after surgery, cine MRI revealed reduced wall thickening in AI (5+/-6% versus 33+/-6% in normal, P<0.001). In RII, wall thickening before, during, and after inflation of the occluder for 15 minutes was 35+/-5%, 1+/-8%, and 21+/-10% and Doppler flow was 19.8+/-5.3, 0.2+/-0.5, and 56.3+/-17.7 (peak hyperemia) cm/s, respectively, confirming occlusion, transient ischemia, and reperfusion. Gd-DTPA-enhanced MR images acquired 30 minutes after contrast revealed hyperenhancement of AI (294+/-96% of normal, P<0.001) but not of RII (98+/-6% of normal, P = NS). Eight weeks later, the chronically infarcted region again hyperenhanced (253+/-54% of normal, n = 8, P<0.001). High-resolution (0.5 x 0.5 x 0.5 mm) ex vivo MRI demonstrated that the spatial extent of hyperenhancement was the same as the spatial extent of myocyte necrosis with and without reperfusion at 1 day (R = 0.99, P<0.001) and 3 days (R = 0.99, P<0.001) and collagenous scar at 8 weeks (R = 0.97, P<0.001).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn the pathophysiologies investigated, contrast MRI distinguishes between reversible and irreversible ischemic injury independent of wall motion and infarct age.",

    "abstract": "On April 13th, 2019, OpenAI Five became the first AI system to defeat the world champions at an esports game. The game of Dota 2 presents novel challenges for AI systems such as long time horizons, imperfect information, and complex, continuous state-action spaces, all challenges which will become increasingly central to more capable AI systems. OpenAI Five leveraged existing reinforcement learning techniques, scaled to learn from batches of approximately 2 million frames every 2 seconds. We developed a distributed training system and tools for continual training which allowed us to train OpenAI Five for 10 months. By defeating the Dota 2 world champion (Team OG), OpenAI Five demonstrates that self-play reinforcement learning can achieve superhuman performance on a difficult task.",

    "title": "Towards Personalized Federated Learning",
    "abstract": "In parallel with the rapid adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) empowered by advances in AI research, there has been growing awareness and concerns of data privacy. Recent significant developments in the data regulation landscape have prompted a seismic shift in interest toward privacy-preserving AI. This has contributed to the popularity of Federated Learning (FL), the leading paradigm for the training of machine learning models on data silos in a privacy-preserving manner. In this survey, we explore the domain of personalized FL (PFL) to address the fundamental challenges of FL on heterogeneous data, a universal characteristic inherent in all real-world datasets. We analyze the key motivations for PFL and present a unique taxonomy of PFL techniques categorized according to the key challenges and personalization strategies in PFL. We highlight their key ideas, challenges, opportunities, and envision promising future trajectories of research toward a new PFL architectural design, realistic PFL benchmarking, and trustworthy PFL approaches.",

However, some commentators have pointed out that generative artificial intelligence (AI) tools such as ChatGPT can enhance student learning, and consequently, academics should adapt their teaching and assessment practices to embrace the new reality of living, working, and studying in a world where AI is freely available. Despite this important debate, there has been very little academic literature published on ChatGPT and other generative AI tools. This article uses content analysis to examine news articles (N=100) about how ChatGPT is disrupting higher education, concentrating specifically on Australia, New Zealand, the United States",

    "title": "Software Engineering for Machine Learning: A Case Study",
    "abstract": "Recent advances in machine learning have stimulated widespread interest within the Information Technology sector on integrating AI capabilities into software and services. This goal has forced organizations to evolve their development processes. We report on a study that we conducted on observing software teams at Microsoft as they develop AI-based applications. We consider a nine-stage workflow process informed by prior experiences developing AI applications (e.g., search and NLP) and data science tools (e.g. application diagnostics and bug reporting). We found that various Microsoft teams have united this workflow into preexisting, well-evolved, Agile-like software engineering processes, providing insights about several essential engineering challenges that organizations may face in creating large-scale AI solutions for the marketplace. We collected some best practices from Microsoft teams to address these challenges. In addition, we have identified three aspects of the AI domain that make it fundamentally different from prior software application domains: 1) discovering, managing, and versioning the data needed for machine learning applications is much more complex and difficult than other types of software engineering, 2) model customization and model reuse require very different skills than are typically found in software teams, and 3) AI components are more difficult to handle as distinct modules than traditional software components - models may be \"entangled\" in complex ways and experience non-monotonic error behavior. We believe that the lessons learned by Microsoft teams will be valuable to other organizations.",

    "abstract": "Dramatic success in machine learning has led to a new wave of AI applications (for example, transportation, security, medicine, finance, defense) that offer tremendous benefits but cannot explain their decisions and actions to human users. DARPA’s explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) program endeavors to create AI systems whose learned models and decisions can be understood and appropriately trusted by end users. Realizing this goal requires methods for learning more explainable models, designing effective explanation interfaces, and understanding the psychologic requirements for effective explanations. The XAI developer teams are addressing the first two challenges by creating ML techniques and developing principles, strategies, and human-computer interaction techniques for generating effective explanations. Another XAI team is addressing the third challenge by summarizing, extending, and applying psychologic theories of explanation to help the XAI evaluator define a suitable evaluation framework, which the developer teams will use to test their systems. The XAI teams completed the first of this 4-year program in May 2018. In a series of ongoing evaluations, the developer teams are assessing how well their XAM systems’ explanations improve user understanding, user trust, and user task performance.",

    "abstract": "Recent progress in Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FTICRMS) provided extensive molecular mass data for complex natural organic matter (NOM). Structural information can be deduced solely from the molecular masses for ions with extreme molecular element ratios, in particular low H/C ratios, which are abundant in thermally altered NOM (e.g. black carbon). In this communication we propose a general aromaticity index (AI) and two threshold values as unequivocal criteria for the existence of either aromatic (AI > 0.5) or condensed aromatic structures (AI >= 0.67) in NOM. AI can be calculated from molecular formulae which are derived from exact molecular masses of naturally occurring compounds containing C, H, O, N, S and P and is especially applicable for substances with aromatic cores and few alkylations. In order to test the validity of our model index, AI is applied to FTICRMS data of a NOM deep-water sample from the Weddell Sea (Antarctica), a fulvic acid standard and an artificial dataset of all theoretically possible molecular formulae. For graphical evaluation a ternary plot is suggested for four-dimensional data representation. The proposed aromaticity index is a step towards structural identification of NOM and the molecular identification of black carbon in the environment.",

    "abstract": "The Internet of Things (IoT) is penetrating many facets of our daily life with the proliferation of intelligent services and applications empowered by artificial intelligence (AI). Traditionally, AI techniques require centralized data collection and processing that may not be feasible in realistic application scenarios due to the high scalability of modern IoT networks and growing data privacy concerns. Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a distributed collaborative AI approach that can enable many intelligent IoT applications, by allowing for AI training at distributed IoT devices without the need for data sharing. In this article, we provide a comprehensive survey of the emerging applications of FL in IoT networks, beginning from an introduction to the recent advances in FL and IoT to a discussion of their integration. Particularly, we explore and analyze the potential of FL for enabling a wide range of IoT services, including IoT data sharing, data offloading and caching, attack detection, localization, mobile crowdsensing, and IoT privacy and security. We then provide an extensive survey of the use of FL in various key IoT applications such as smart healthcare, smart transportation, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), smart cities, and smart industry. The important lessons learned from this review of the FL-IoT services and applications are also highlighted. We complete this survey by highlighting the current challenges and possible directions for future research in this booming area.",

In order to answer, the agent must first intelligently navigate to explore the environment, gather necessary visual information through first-person (egocentric) vision, and then answer the question ('orange'). EmbodiedQA requires a range of AI skills - language understanding, visual recognition, active perception, goal-driven navigation, commonsense reasoning, long-term memory, and grounding language into actions. In this work, we develop a dataset of questions and answers in House3D environments [1], evaluation metrics, and a hierarchical model trained with imitation and reinforcement learning.",

    "title": "The 1998 AI Planning Systems Competition",
    "abstract": "The 1998 Planning Competition at the AI Planning Systems Conference was the first of its kind. Its goal was to create planning domains that a wide variety of planning researchers could agree on to make comparison among planners more meaningful, measure overall progress in the field, and set up a framework for long-term creation of a repository of problems in a standard notation. A rules committee for the competition was created in 1997 and had long discussions on how the contest should go. One result of these discussions was the pddl notation for planning domains. This notation was used to set up a set of planning problems and get a modest problem repository started. As a result, five planning systems were able to compete when the contest took place in June 1998. All these systems solved problems in the strips framework, with some slight extensions. The attempt to find domains for other forms of planning foundered because of technical and organizational problems. In spite of this problem, the competition achieved its goals partially in that it con-firmed that substantial progress had occurred in some subfields of planning, and it allowed qualitative comparison among different planning algorithms. It is urged that the competition continue to take place and to evolve.",

    "title": "What ChatGPT means for universities: Perceptions of scholars and students",
    "abstract": "This study investigates the implications of ChatGPT, an AI-powered language model, for students and universities by examining the perceptions of scholars and students. The responses of seven scholars and 14 PhD students from four countries – Turkey, Sweden, Canada and Australia – are analysed using a thematic content analysis approach. Nine key themes emerge from the findings. According to their frequency of recurrence, these themes are: “Evolution of learning and education systems”, “changing role of educators”, “impact on assessment and evaluation”, “ethical and social considerations”, “future of work and employability”, “personalized learning”, “digital literacy and AI integration”, “AI as an extension of the human brain”, and “importance of human characteristics”. The potential benefits of AI in education as well as the challenges and barriers that may arise from its integration are discussed in the context of existing literature. Based on these findings, suggestions for future research include further exploration of the ethical implications of AI for education, the development of strategies to manage privacy concerns, and the investigation of how educational institutions can best prepare for the integration of AI technologies. The paper concludes by emphasizing the importance of understanding the potential opportunities and challenges associated with AI in higher education and the need for continued research in this area.",

    "title": "Prompt Engineering as an Important Emerging Skill for Medical Professionals: Tutorial",
    "abstract": "Prompt engineering is a relatively new field of research that refers to the practice of designing, refining, and implementing prompts or instructions that guide the output of large language models (LLMs) to help in various tasks. With the emergence of LLMs, the most popular one being ChatGPT that has attracted the attention of over a 100 million users in only 2 months, artificial intelligence (AI), especially generative AI, has become accessible for the masses. This is an unprecedented paradigm shift not only because of the use of AI becoming more widespread but also due to the possible implications of LLMs in health care. As more patients and medical professionals use AI-based tools, LLMs being the most popular representatives of that group, it seems inevitable to address the challenge to improve this skill. This paper summarizes the current state of research about prompt engineering and, at the same time, aims at providing practical recommendations for the wide range of health care professionals to improve their interactions with LLMs.",

    "title": "Resistance To Medical Artificial Intelligence",
    "abstract": "\n Artificial intelligence (AI) is revolutionizing healthcare, but little is known about consumer receptivity to AI in medicine. Consumers are reluctant to utilize healthcare provided by AI in real and hypothetical choices, separate and joint evaluations. Consumers are less likely to utilize healthcare (study 1), exhibit lower reservation prices for healthcare (study 2), are less sensitive to differences in provider performance (studies 3A–3C), and derive negative utility if a provider is automated rather than human (study 4). Uniqueness neglect, a concern that AI providers are less able than human providers to account for consumers’ unique characteristics and circumstances, drives consumer resistance to medical AI. Indeed, resistance to medical AI is stronger for consumers who perceive themselves to be more unique (study 5). Uniqueness neglect mediates resistance to medical AI (study 6), and is eliminated when AI provides care (a) that is framed as personalized (study 7), (b) to consumers other than the self (study 8), or (c) that only supports, rather than replaces, a decision made by a human healthcare provider (study 9). These findings make contributions to the psychology of automation and medical decision making, and suggest interventions to increase consumer acceptance of AI in medicine.",

    "title": "Dynamic Game Difficulty Scaling Using Adaptive Behavior-Based AI",
    "abstract": "Games are played by a wide variety of audiences. Different individuals will play with different gaming styles and employ different strategic approaches. This often involves interacting with nonplayer characters that are controlled by the game AI. From a developer's standpoint, it is important to design a game AI that is able to satisfy the variety of players that will interact with the game. Thus, an adaptive game AI that can scale the difficulty of the game according to the proficiency of the player has greater potential to customize a personalized and entertaining game experience compared to a static game AI. In particular, dynamic game difficulty scaling refers to the use of an adaptive game AI that performs game adaptations in real time during the game session. This paper presents two adaptive algorithms that use ideas from reinforcement learning and evolutionary computation to improve player satisfaction by scaling the difficulty of the game AI while the game is being played. The effects of varying the learning and mutation rates are examined and a general rule of thumb for the parameters is proposed. The proposed algorithms are demonstrated to be capable of matching its opponents in terms of mean scores and winning percentages. Both algorithms are able to generalize well to a variety of opponents.",

    "title": "The Basic AI Drives",
    "abstract": "One might imagine that AI systems with harmless goals will be harmless. This paper instead shows that intelligent systems will need to be carefully designed to prevent them from behaving in harmful ways. We identify a number of “drives” that will appear in sufficiently advanced AI systems of any design. We call them drives because they are tendencies which will be present unless explicitly counteracted. We start by showing that goal-seeking systems will have drives to model their own operation and to improve themselves. We then show that self-improving systems will be driven to clarify their goals and represent them as economic utility functions. They will also strive for their actions to approximate rational economic behavior. This will lead almost all systems to protect their utility functions from modification and their utility measurement systems from corruption. We also discuss some exceptional systems which will want to modify their utility functions. We next discuss the drive toward self-protection which causes systems try to prevent themselves from being harmed. Finally we examine drives toward the acquisition of resources and toward their efficient utilization. We end with a discussion of how to incorporate these insights in designing intelligent technology which will lead to a positive future for humanity.",

    "abstract": "In this tutorial paper, we look into the evolution and prospect of network architecture and propose a novel conceptual architecture for the 6th generation (6G) networks. The proposed architecture has two key elements, i.e., holistic network virtualization and pervasive artificial intelligence (AI). The holistic network virtualization consists of network slicing and digital twin, from the aspects of service provision and service demand, respectively, to incorporate service-centric and user-centric networking. The pervasive network intelligence integrates AI into future networks from the perspectives of networking for AI and AI for networking, respectively. Building on holistic network virtualization and pervasive network intelligence, the proposed architecture can facilitate three types of interplay, i.e., the interplay between digital twin and network slicing paradigms, between model-driven and data-driven methods for network management, and between virtualization and AI, to maximize the flexibility, scalability, adaptivity, and intelligence for 6G networks. We also identify challenges and open issues related to the proposed architecture. By providing our vision, we aim to inspire further discussions and developments on the potential architecture of 6G.",

    "title": "Redefining Radiology: A Review of Artificial Intelligence Integration in Medical Imaging",
    "abstract": "This comprehensive review unfolds a detailed narrative of Artificial Intelligence (AI) making its foray into radiology, a move that is catalysing transformational shifts in the healthcare landscape. It traces the evolution of radiology, from the initial discovery of X-rays to the application of machine learning and deep learning in modern medical image analysis. The primary focus of this review is to shed light on AI applications in radiology, elucidating their seminal roles in image segmentation, computer-aided diagnosis, predictive analytics, and workflow optimisation. A spotlight is cast on the profound impact of AI on diagnostic processes, personalised medicine, and clinical workflows, with empirical evidence derived from a series of case studies across multiple medical disciplines. However, the integration of AI in radiology is not devoid of challenges. The review ventures into the labyrinth of obstacles that are inherent to AI-driven radiology—data quality, the ’black box’ enigma, infrastructural and technical complexities, as well as ethical implications. Peering into the future, the review contends that the road ahead for AI in radiology is paved with promising opportunities. It advocates for continuous research, embracing avant-garde imaging technologies, and fostering robust collaborations between radiologists and AI developers. The conclusion underlines the role of AI as a catalyst for change in radiology, a stance that is firmly rooted in sustained innovation, dynamic partnerships, and a steadfast commitment to ethical responsibility.",

    "title": "Impact of Artificial Intelligence on Dental Education: A Review and Guide for Curriculum Update",
    "abstract": "In this intellectual work, the clinical and educational aspects of dentistry were confronted with practical applications of artificial intelligence (AI). The aim was to provide an up-to-date overview of the upcoming changes and a brief analysis of the influential advancements in the use of AI in dental education since 2020. In addition, this review provides a guide for a dental curriculum update for undergraduate and postgraduate education in the context of advances in AI applications and their impact on dentistry. Unsurprisingly, most dental educators have limited knowledge and skills to assess AI applications, as they were not trained to do so. Also, AI technology has evolved exponentially in recent years. Factual reliability and opportunities with OpenAI Inc.’s ChatGPT are considered critical inflection points in the era of generative AI. Updating curricula at dental institutions is inevitable as advanced deep-learning approaches take over the clinical areas of dentistry and reshape diagnostics, treatment planning, management, and telemedicine screening. With recent advances in AI language models, communication with patients will change, and the foundations of dental education, including essay, thesis, or scientific paper writing, will need to adapt. However, there is a growing concern about its ethical and legal implications, and further consensus is needed for the safe and responsible implementation of AI in dental education.",

    "title": "Fairness And Bias in Artificial Intelligence: A Brief Survey of Sources, Impacts, And Mitigation Strategies",
    "abstract": "The significant advancements in applying artificial intelligence (AI) to healthcare decision-making, medical diagnosis, and other domains have simultaneously raised concerns about the fairness and bias of AI systems. This is particularly critical in areas like healthcare, employment, criminal justice, credit scoring, and increasingly, in generative AI models (GenAI) that produce synthetic media. Such systems can lead to unfair outcomes and perpetuate existing inequalities, including generative biases that affect the representation of individuals in synthetic data. This survey study offers a succinct, comprehensive overview of fairness and bias in AI, addressing their sources, impacts, and mitigation strategies. We review sources of bias, such as data, algorithm, and human decision biases—highlighting the emergent issue of generative AI bias, where models may reproduce and amplify societal stereotypes. We assess the societal impact of biased AI systems, focusing on perpetuating inequalities and reinforcing harmful stereotypes, especially as generative AI becomes more prevalent in creating content that influences public perception. We explore various proposed mitigation strategies, discuss the ethical considerations of their implementation, and emphasize the need for interdisciplinary collaboration to ensure effectiveness. Through a systematic literature review spanning multiple academic disciplines, we present definitions of AI bias and its different types, including a detailed look at generative AI bias. We discuss the negative impacts of AI bias on individuals and society and provide an overview of current approaches to mitigate AI bias, including data pre-processing, model selection, and post-processing. We emphasize the unique challenges presented by generative AI models and the importance of strategies specifically tailored to address these. Addressing bias in AI requires a holistic approach involving diverse and representative datasets, enhanced transparency and accountability in AI systems, and the exploration of alternative AI paradigms that prioritize fairness and ethical considerations. This survey contributes to the ongoing discussion on developing fair and unbiased AI systems by providing an overview of the sources, impacts, and mitigation strategies related to AI bias, with a particular focus on the emerging field of generative AI.",

    "abstract": "The last decade witnessed increasingly rapid progress in self‐driving vehicle technology, mainly backed up by advances in the area of deep learning and artificial intelligence (AI). The objective of this paper is to survey the current state‐of‐the‐art on deep learning technologies used in autonomous driving. We start by presenting AI‐based self‐driving architectures, convolutional and recurrent neural networks, as well as the deep reinforcement learning paradigm. These methodologies form a base for the surveyed driving scene perception, path planning, behavior arbitration, and motion control algorithms. We investigate both the modular perception‐planning‐action pipeline, where each module is built using deep learning methods, as well as End2End systems, which directly map sensory information to steering commands. Additionally, we tackle current challenges encountered in designing AI architectures for autonomous driving, such as their safety, training data sources, and computational hardware. The comparison presented in this survey helps gain insight into the strengths and limitations of deep learning and AI approaches for autonomous driving and assist with design choices.",

    "abstract": "Explainable artificial intelligence (AI) is attracting much interest in medicine. Technically, the problem of explainability is as old as AI itself and classic AI represented comprehensible retraceable approaches. However, their weakness was in dealing with uncertainties of the real world. Through the introduction of probabilistic learning, applications became increasingly successful, but increasingly opaque. Explainable AI deals with the implementation of transparency and traceability of statistical black‐box machine learning methods, particularly deep learning (DL). We argue that there is a need to go beyond explainable AI. To reach a level of explainable medicine we need causability. In the same way that usability encompasses measurements for the quality of use, causability encompasses measurements for the quality of explanations. In this article, we provide some necessary definitions to discriminate between explainability and causability as well as a use‐case of DL interpretation and of human explanation in histopathology. The main contribution of this article is the notion of causability, which is differentiated from explainability in that causability is a property of a person, while explainability is a property of a system",

But what happens if we actually succeed? Creating superior intelligence would be the biggest event in human history. Unfortunately, according to the world's pre-eminent AI expert, it could also be the last. In this groundbreaking book on the biggest question facing humanity, Stuart Russell explains why he has come to consider his own discipline an existential threat to our species, and lays out how we can change course before it's too late. There is no one better placed to assess the promise and perils of the dominant technology of the future than Russell, who has spent decades at the forefront of AI research. Through brilliant analogies and crisp, lucid prose, he explains how AI actually works, how it has an enormous capacity to improve our lives - but why we must ensure that we never lose control of machines more powerful than we are. Here Russell shows how we can avert the worst threats by reshaping the foundations of AI to guarantee that machines pursue our objectives, not theirs. Profound, urgent and visionary, Human Compatible is the one book everyone needs to read to understand a future that is coming sooner than we think.",

    "title": "Effect of interval between induction of ovulation and artificial insemination (AI) and supplemental progesterone for resynchronization on fertility of dairy cows subjected to a 5-d timed AI program.",
    "abstract": "Objectives were to investigate 2 intervals from induction of ovulation to artificial insemination (AI) and the effect of supplemental progesterone for resynchronization on fertility of lactating dairy cows subjected to a 5-d timed AI program. In experiment 1, 1,227 Holstein cows had their estrous cycles presynchronized with 2 injections of PGF(2α) at 46 and 60 d in milk (DIM). The timed AI protocols were initiated with GnRH at 72 DIM, followed by 2 injections of PGF(2α) at 77 and 78 DIM and a second injection of GnRH at either 56 (OVS56) or 72h (COS72) after the first PGF(2α) of the timed AI protocols. All cows were time-inseminated at 72h after the first PGF(2α) injection. Pregnancy was diagnosed on d 32 and 60 after AI. In experiment 2, 675 nonpregnant Holstein cows had their estrous cycles resynchronized starting at 34 d after the first AI. Cows received the OVS56 with (RCIDR) or without (RCON) supplemental progesterone, as an intravaginal insert, from the first GnRH to the first PGF(2α). Pregnancy diagnoses were performed on d 32 and 60 after AI. During experiment 2, subsets of cows had their ovaries scanned by ultrasonography at the first GnRH, the first PGF(2α), and second GnRH injections of the protocol. Blood was sampled on the day of AI and 7 d later, and concentrations of progesterone were determined in plasma. Cows were considered to have a synchronized ovulation if they had progesterone <1 and >2.26 ng/mL on the day of AI and 7 d later, respectively, and if no ovulation was detected between the first PGF(2α) and second GnRH injections during resynchronization. In experiment 1, the proportion of cows detected in estrus at AI was greater for COS72 than OVS56 (40.6 vs. 32.4%). Pregnancy per AI (P/AI) did not differ between OVS56 (46.4%) and COS72 (45.5%). In experiment 2, cows supplemented with progesterone had greater P/AI compared with unsupplemented cows (51.3 vs. 43.1%). Premature ovulation tended to be greater for RCON than RCIDR cows (7.5 vs. 3.6%), although synchronization of the estrous cycle after timed AI was similar between treatments. Timing of induction of ovulation with GnRH relative to insemination did not affect P/AI of dairy cows enrolled in a 5-d timed AI program. Furthermore, during resynchronization starting on d 34 after the first AI, supplementation with progesterone improved P/AI in cows subjected to the 5-d timed AI protocol.",

    "title": "Multiagent Systems: A Modern Approach to Dis- tributed Artificial Intelligence A Review",
    "abstract": "dent on automated intelligent systems; at the same time, these systems have become more and more complicated. Society’s expectation regarding the capabilities and intelligence of such systems has also grown. We have become a more complicated society with more complicated problems. As the expectation of intelligent systems rises, we discover many more applications for AI. Additionally, as the difficulty level and computational requirements of such problems rise, there is a need to distribute the problem solving. Although the field of multiagent systems and distributed AI is relatively young, the importance and applicability of this technology for solving today’s problems continues to grow. As the title indicates, Multiagent Systems: A Modern Approach to Distributed Artificial Intelligence covers the design and development of multiagent and distributed AI systems. The purpose of this book is to provide a comprehensive overview of the field. It is an excellent collection of closely related papers that provides a wonderful introduction to multiagent systems and distributed AI. The book provides not only basic introductory information but also detailed discussions covering the important topics in the field, practical examples and applications, and a section dedicated to the relationship between multiagent systems and various other research areas. This book compiles the important concepts and methodologies required to develop a multiagent system in an understandable, and comprehensive, manner. Not only does the book focus on the known solutions and issues, it also discusses the open questions and dilemmas. The prologue begins by defining distributed AI as “the study, construc-",

    "title": "Anemia of inflammation.",
    "abstract": "Anemia of inflammation (AI), also known as anemia of chronic disease (ACD), is regarded as the most frequent anemia in hospitalized and chronically ill patients. It is prevalent in patients with diseases that cause prolonged immune activation, including infection, autoimmune diseases, and cancer. More recently, the list has grown to include chronic kidney disease, congestive heart failure, chronic pulmonary diseases, and obesity. Inflammation-inducible cytokines and the master regulator of iron homeostasis, hepcidin, block intestinal iron absorption and cause iron retention in reticuloendothelial cells, resulting in iron-restricted erythropoiesis. In addition, shortened erythrocyte half-life, suppressed erythropoietin response to anemia, and inhibition of erythroid cell differentiation by inflammatory mediators further contribute to AI in a disease-specific pattern. Although the diagnosis of AI is a diagnosis of exclusion and is supported by characteristic alterations in iron homeostasis, hypoferremia, and hyperferritinemia, the diagnosis of AI patients with coexisting iron deficiency is more difficult. In addition to treatment of the disease underlying AI, the combination of iron therapy and erythropoiesis-stimulating agents can improve anemia in many patients. In the future, emerging therapeutics that antagonize hepcidin function and redistribute endogenous iron for erythropoiesis may offer additional options. However, based on experience with anemia treatment in chronic kidney disease, critical illness, and cancer, finding the appropriate indications for the specific treatment of AI will require improved understanding and a balanced consideration of the contribution of anemia to each patient's morbidity and the impact of anemia treatment on the patient's prognosis in a variety of disease settings.",

    "title": "Bias in data‐driven artificial intelligence systems—An introductory survey",
    "abstract": "Artificial Intelligence (AI)‐based systems are widely employed nowadays to make decisions that have far‐reaching impact on individuals and society. Their decisions might affect everyone, everywhere, and anytime, entailing concerns about potential human rights issues. Therefore, it is necessary to move beyond traditional AI algorithms optimized for predictive performance and embed ethical and legal principles in their design, training, and deployment to ensure social good while still benefiting from the huge potential of the AI technology. The goal of this survey is to provide a broad multidisciplinary overview of the area of bias in AI systems, focusing on technical challenges and solutions as well as to suggest new research directions towards approaches well‐grounded in a legal frame. In this survey, we focus on data‐driven AI, as a large part of AI is powered nowadays by (big) data and powerful machine learning algorithms. If otherwise not specified, we use the general term bias to describe problems related to the gathering or processing of data that might result in prejudiced decisions on the bases of demographic features such as race, sex, and so forth.",

    "title": "The LuxS‐dependent autoinducer AI‐2 controls the expression of an ABC transporter that functions in AI‐2 uptake in Salmonella typhimurium",
    "abstract": "In a process called quorum sensing, bacteria communicate with one another using secreted chemical signalling molecules termed autoinducers. A novel autoinducer called AI‐2, originally discovered in the quorum‐sensing bacterium Vibrio harveyi, is made by many species of Gram‐negative and Gram‐positive bacteria. In every case, production of AI‐2 is dependent on the LuxS autoinducer synthase. The genes regulated by AI‐2 in most of these luxS‐containing species of bacteria are not known. Here, we describe the identification and characterization of AI‐2‐regulated genes in Salmonella typhimurium. We find that LuxS and AI‐2 regulate the expression of a previously unidentified operon encoding an ATP binding cassette (ABC)‐type transporter. We have named this operon the lsr (luxS regulated) operon. The Lsr transporter has homology to the ribose transporter of Escherichia coli and S. typhimurium. A gene encoding a DNA‐binding protein that is located adjacent to the Lsr transporter structural operon is required to link AI‐2 detection to operon expression. This gene, which we have named lsrR, encodes a protein that represses lsr operon expression in the absence of AI‐2. Mutations in the lsr operon render S. typhimurium unable to eliminate AI‐2 from the extracellular environment, suggesting that the role of the Lsr apparatus is to transport AI‐2 into the cells. It is intriguing that an operon regulated by AI‐2 encodes functions resembling the ribose transporter, given recent findings that AI‐2 is derived from the ribosyl moiety of S‐ribosylhomocysteine.",

    "title": "Lsr‐mediated transport and processing of AI‐2 in Salmonella typhimurium",
    "abstract": "The LuxS‐dependent autoinducer AI‐2 is proposed to function in interspecies cell–cell communication in bacteria. In Salmonella typhimurium, AI‐2 is produced and released during exponential growth and is subsequently imported into the bacteria via the Lsr (luxS regulated) ATP binding cassette (ABC) transporter. AI‐2 induces transcription of the lsrACDBFGE operon, the first four genes of which encode the Lsr transport apparatus. In this report, we identify and characterize LsrK, a new protein that is required for the regulation of the lsr operon and the AI‐2 uptake process. LsrK is a kinase that phosphorylates AI‐2 upon entry into the cell. Our data indicate that phosphorylation of AI‐2 results in its sequestration in the cytoplasm. We suggest that phospho‐AI‐2 is the inducer responsible for inactivation of LsrR, the repressor of the lsr operon. We also show that two previously uncharacterized members of the lsr operon, LsrF and LsrG, are necessary for the further processing of phospho‐AI‐2. Transport and processing of AI‐2 could be required for removing the quorum‐sensing signal, conveying the signal to an internal detector and/or scavenging boron.",

    "title": "Microsoft Academic Graph: When experts are not enough",
    "abstract": "Abstract An ongoing project explores the extent to which artificial intelligence (AI), specifically in the areas of natural language processing and semantic reasoning, can be exploited to facilitate the studies of science by deploying software agents equipped with natural language understanding capabilities to read scholarly publications on the web. The knowledge extracted by these AI agents is organized into a heterogeneous graph, called Microsoft Academic Graph (MAG), where the nodes and the edges represent the entities engaging in scholarly communications and the relationships among them, respectively. The frequently updated data set and a few software tools central to the underlying AI components are distributed under an open data license for research and commercial applications. This paper describes the design, schema, and technical and business motivations behind MAG and elaborates how MAG can be used in analytics, search, and recommendation scenarios. How AI plays an important role in avoiding various biases and human induced errors in other data sets and how the technologies can be further improved in the future are also discussed.",

    "title": "Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence: A Review",
    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) and algorithmic decision making are having a profound impact on our daily lives. These systems are vastly used in different high-stakes applications like healthcare, business, government, education, and justice, moving us toward a more algorithmic society. However, despite so many advantages of these systems, they sometimes directly or indirectly cause harm to the users and society. Therefore, it has become essential to make these systems safe, reliable, and trustworthy. Several requirements, such as fairness, explainability, accountability, reliability, and acceptance, have been proposed in this direction to make these systems trustworthy. This survey analyzes all of these different requirements through the lens of the literature. It provides an overview of different approaches that can help mitigate AI risks and increase trust and acceptance of the systems by utilizing the users and society. It also discusses existing strategies for validating and verifying these systems and the current standardization efforts for trustworthy AI. Finally, we present a holistic view of the recent advancements in trustworthy AI to help the interested researchers grasp the crucial facets of the topic efficiently and offer possible future research directions.",

    "title": "Data-centric Artificial Intelligence: A Survey",
    "abstract": "\n Artificial Intelligence (AI) is making a profound impact in almost every domain. A vital enabler of its great success is the availability of abundant and high-quality data for building machine learning models. Recently, the role of data in AI has been significantly magnified, giving rise to the emerging concept of\n data-centric AI\n . The attention of researchers and practitioners has gradually shifted from advancing model design to enhancing the quality and quantity of the data. In this survey, we discuss the necessity of data-centric AI, followed by a holistic view of three general data-centric goals (training data development, inference data development, and data maintenance) and the representative methods. We also organize the existing literature from automation and collaboration perspectives, discuss the challenges, and tabulate the benchmarks for various tasks. We believe this is the first comprehensive survey that provides a global view of a spectrum of tasks across various stages of the data lifecycle. We hope it can help the readers efficiently grasp a broad picture of this field, and equip them with the techniques and further research ideas to systematically engineer data for building AI systems. A companion list of data-centric AI resources will be regularly updated on https://github.com/daochenzha/data-centric-AI\n",

    "title": "Human-level play in the game of Diplomacy by combining language models with strategic reasoning",
    "abstract": "Despite much progress in training artificial intelligence (AI) systems to imitate human language, building agents that use language to communicate intentionally with humans in interactive environments remains a major challenge. We introduce Cicero, the first AI agent to achieve human-level performance in Diplomacy, a strategy game involving both cooperation and competition that emphasizes natural language negotiation and tactical coordination between seven players. Cicero integrates a language model with planning and reinforcement learning algorithms by inferring players’ beliefs and intentions from its conversations and generating dialogue in pursuit of its plans. Across 40 games of an anonymous online Diplomacy league, Cicero achieved more than double the average score of the human players and ranked in the top 10% of participants who played more than one game. Description AI masters Diplomacy The game Diplomacy has been a major challenge for artificial intelligence (AI). Unlike other competitive games that AI has recently mastered, such as chess, Go, and poker, Diplomacy cannot be solved purely through self-play; it requires the development of an agent to understand other players’ motivations and perspectives and to use natural language to negotiate complex shared plans. The Meta Fundamental AI Research Diplomacy Team (FAIR) et al. developed an agent that is able to play the full natural language form of the game and demonstrates performance well above the human average in an online Diplomacy league. The present work has far-reaching implications for the development of cooperative AI and language models for communication with people, even when interactions involve a mixture of aligned and competing interests. —YS Artificial intelligence demonstrates human-level performance in the strategic board game Diplomacy.",

    "abstract": "Objective: The aim of this review was to summarize major topics in artificial intelligence (AI), including their applications and limitations in surgery. This paper reviews the key capabilities of AI to help surgeons understand and critically evaluate new AI applications and to contribute to new developments. Summary Background Data: AI is composed of various subfields that each provide potential solutions to clinical problems. Each of the core subfields of AI reviewed in this piece has also been used in other industries such as the autonomous car, social networks, and deep learning computers. Methods: A review of AI papers across computer science, statistics, and medical sources was conducted to identify key concepts and techniques within AI that are driving innovation across industries, including surgery. Limitations and challenges of working with AI were also reviewed. Results: Four main subfields of AI were defined: (1) machine learning, (2) artificial neural networks, (3) natural language processing, and (4) computer vision. Their current and future applications to surgical practice were introduced, including big data analytics and clinical decision support systems. The implications of AI for surgeons and the role of surgeons in advancing the technology to optimize clinical effectiveness were discussed. Conclusions: Surgeons are well positioned to help integrate AI into modern practice. Surgeons should partner with data scientists to capture data across phases of care and to provide clinical context, for AI has the potential to revolutionize the way surgery is taught and practiced with the promise of a future optimized for the highest quality patient care.",

    "title": "Comparing scientific abstracts generated by ChatGPT to original abstracts using an artificial intelligence output detector, plagiarism detector, and blinded human reviewers",
    "abstract": "Background Large language models such as ChatGPT can produce increasingly realistic text, with unknown information on the accuracy and integrity of using these models in scientific writing. Methods We gathered ten research abstracts from five high impact factor medical journals (n=50) and asked ChatGPT to generate research abstracts based on their titles and journals. We evaluated the abstracts using an artificial intelligence (AI) output detector, plagiarism detector, and had blinded human reviewers try to distinguish whether abstracts were original or generated. Results All ChatGPT-generated abstracts were written clearly but only 8% correctly followed the specific journal’s formatting requirements. Most generated abstracts were detected using the AI output detector, with scores (higher meaning more likely to be generated) of median [interquartile range] of 99.98% [12.73, 99.98] compared with very low probability of AI-generated output in the original abstracts of 0.02% [0.02, 0.09]. The AUROC of the AI output detector was 0.94. Generated abstracts scored very high on originality using the plagiarism detector (100% [100, 100] originality). Generated abstracts had a similar patient cohort size as original abstracts, though the exact numbers were fabricated. When given a mixture of original and general abstracts, blinded human reviewers correctly identified 68% of generated abstracts as being generated by ChatGPT, but incorrectly identified 14% of original abstracts as being generated. Reviewers indicated that it was surprisingly difficult to differentiate between the two, but that the generated abstracts were vaguer and had a formulaic feel to the writing. Conclusion ChatGPT writes believable scientific abstracts, though with completely generated data. These are original without any plagiarism detected but are often identifiable using an AI output detector and skeptical human reviewers. Abstract evaluation for journals and medical conferences must adapt policy and practice to maintain rigorous scientific standards; we suggest inclusion of AI output detectors in the editorial process and clear disclosure if these technologies are used. The boundaries of ethical and acceptable use of large language models to help scientific writing remain to be determined.",

    "abstract": "Although AI and HCI explore computing and intelligent behavior and the fields have seen some cross-over, until recently there was not very much. This article outlines a history of the fields that identifies some of the forces that kept the fields at arm’s length. AI was generally marked by a very ambitious, long-term vision requiring expensive systems, although the term was rarely envisioned as being as long as it proved to be, whereas HCI focused more on innovation and improvement of widely-used hardware within a short time-scale. These differences led to different priorities, methods, and assessment approaches. A consequence was competition for resources, with HCI flourishing in AI winters and moving more slowly when AI was in favor. The situation today is much more promising, in part because of platform convergence: AI can be exploited on widely-used systems.",

    "abstract": "Accountability is a cornerstone of the governance of artificial intelligence (AI). However, it is often defined too imprecisely because its multifaceted nature and the sociotechnical structure of AI systems imply a variety of values, practices, and measures to which accountability in AI can refer. We address this lack of clarity by defining accountability in terms of answerability, identifying three conditions of possibility (authority recognition, interrogation, and limitation of power), and an architecture of seven features (context, range, agent, forum, standards, process, and implications). We analyze this architecture through four accountability goals (compliance, report, oversight, and enforcement). We argue that these goals are often complementary and that policy-makers emphasize or prioritize some over others depending on the proactive or reactive use of accountability and the missions of AI governance.",

    "abstract": "In medicine, artificial intelligence (AI) research is becoming increasingly focused on applying machine learning (ML) techniques to complex problems, and so allowing computers to make predictions from large amounts of patient data, by learning their own associations.1 Estimates of the impact of AI on the wider economy globally vary wildly, with a recent report suggesting a 14% effect on global gross domestic product by 2030, half of which coming from productivity improvements.2 These predictions create political appetite for the rapid development of the AI industry,3 and healthcare is a priority area where this technology has yet to be exploited.2 3 The digital health revolution described by Duggal et al 4 is already in full swing with the potential to ‘disrupt’ healthcare. Health AI research has demonstrated some impressive results,5–10 but its clinical value has not yet been realised, hindered partly by a lack of a clear understanding of how to quantify benefit or ensure patient safety, and increasing concerns about the ethical and medico-legal impact.11 \n\nThis analysis is written with the dual aim of helping clinical safety professionals to critically appraise current medical AI research from a quality and safety perspective, and supporting research and development in AI by highlighting some of the clinical safety questions that must be considered if medical application of these exciting technologies is to be successful.\n\nClinical decision support systems (DSS) are in widespread use in medicine and have had most impact providing guidance on the safe prescription of medicines,12 guideline adherence, simple risk screening13 or prognostic scoring.14 These systems use predefined rules, which have predictable behaviour and are usually shown to reduce clinical error,12 although sometimes inadvertently introduce safety issues themselves.15 16 Rules-based systems have also been developed to address diagnostic uncertainty17–19 …",

John McCarthy first described the term AI in 1956 as the science and engineering of making intelligent machines. Objective: This descriptive article gives a broad overview of AI in medicine, dealing with the terms and concepts as well as the current and future applications of AI. It aims to develop knowledge and familiarity of AI among primary care physicians. Materials and Methods: PubMed and Google searches were performed using the key words 'artificial intelligence'. Further references were obtained by cross-referencing the key articles. Results: Recent advances in AI technology and its current applications in the field of medicine have been discussed in detail. Conclusions: AI promises to change the practice of medicine in hitherto unknown ways, but many of its practical applications are still in their infancy and need to be explored and developed better. Medical professionals also need to understand and acclimatize themselves with these advances for better healthcare delivery to the masses.",

    "abstract": "The thriving of artificial intelligence (AI) applications is driving the further evolution of wireless networks. It has been envisioned that 6G will be transformative and will revolutionize the evolution of wireless from “connected things” to “connected intelligence”. However, state-of-the-art deep learning and big data analytics based AI systems require tremendous computation and communication resources, causing significant latency, energy consumption, network congestion, and privacy leakage in both of the training and inference processes. By embedding model training and inference capabilities into the network edge, edge AI stands out as a disruptive technology for 6G to seamlessly integrate sensing, communication, computation, and intelligence, thereby improving the efficiency, effectiveness, privacy, and security of 6G networks. In this paper, we shall provide our vision for scalable and trustworthy edge AI systems with integrated design of wireless communication strategies and decentralized machine learning models. New design principles of wireless networks, service-driven resource allocation optimization methods, as well as a holistic end-to-end system architecture to support edge AI will be described. Standardization, software and hardware platforms, and application scenarios are also discussed to facilitate the industrialization and commercialization of edge AI systems.",

    "abstract": "Apolipoprotein E (apo E)-deficient mice are severely hypercholesterolemic and develop advanced atheromas independent of diet. The C57BL/6 strain differs from most inbred strains by having lower HDL concentrations and a high risk of developing early atherosclerotic lesions when fed an atherogenic diet. The relative HDL deficiency and atherosclerosis susceptibility of the C57BL/6 strain are corrected with the expression of a human apolipoprotein AI (apo AI) transgene in this genetic background. To examine if increases in apo AI and HDL are also effective in minimizing apo E deficiency--induced atherosclerosis, we introduced the human apo AI transgene into the hypercholesterolemic apo E knockout background. Similar elevations of total plasma cholesterol occurred in both the apo E knockout and apo E knockout mice also expressing the human apo AI transgene. The latter animals, however, also showed a two- to threefold increase in HDL and a sixfold decrease in susceptibility to atherosclerosis. This study demonstrates that elevating the concentration of apo AI reduces atherosclerosis in apo E deficient-mice and suggests that elevation of apo AI and HDL may prove to be a useful approach for treating unrelated causes of heightened atherosclerosis susceptibility.",

    "abstract": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) is having a tremendous impact across most areas of science. Applications of AI in healthcare have the potential to improve our ability to detect, diagnose, prognose, and intervene on human disease. For AI models to be used clinically, they need to be made safe, reproducible and robust, and the underlying software framework must be aware of the particularities (e.g. geometry, physiology, physics) of medical data being processed. This work introduces MONAI, a freely available, community-supported, and consortium-led PyTorch-based framework for deep learning in healthcare. MONAI extends PyTorch to support medical data, with a particular focus on imaging, and provide purpose-specific AI model architectures, transformations and utilities that streamline the development and deployment of medical AI models. MONAI follows best practices for software-development, providing an easy-to-use, robust, well-documented, and well-tested software framework. MONAI preserves the simple, additive, and compositional approach of its underlying PyTorch libraries. MONAI is being used by and receiving contributions from research, clinical and industrial teams from around the world, who are pursuing applications spanning nearly every aspect of healthcare.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI), and, in particular, deep learning as a subcategory of AI, provides opportunities for the discovery and development of innovative drugs. Various machine learning approaches have recently (re)emerged, some of which may be considered instances of domain-specific AI which have been successfully employed for drug discovery and design. This review provides a comprehensive portrayal of these machine learning techniques and of their applications in medicinal chemistry. After introducing the basic principles, alongside some application notes, of the various machine learning algorithms, the current state-of-the art of AI-assisted pharmaceutical discovery is discussed, including applications in structure- and ligand-based virtual screening, de novo drug design, physicochemical and pharmacokinetic property prediction, drug repurposing, and related aspects. Finally, several challenges and limitations of the current methods are summarized, with a view to potential future directions for AI-assisted drug discovery and design.",

    "title": "Rapid and Reliable Adaptation of Video Game AI",
    "abstract": "Current approaches to adaptive game AI typically require numerous trials to learn effective behavior (i.e., game adaptation is not rapid). In addition, game developers are concerned that applying adaptive game AI may result in uncontrollable and unpredictable behavior (i.e., game adaptation is not reliable). These characteristics hamper the incorporation of adaptive game AI in commercially available video games. In this paper, we discuss an alternative to these current approaches. Our alternative approach to adaptive game AI has as its goal adapting rapidly and reliably to game circumstances. Our approach can be classified in the area of case-based adaptive game AI. In the approach, domain knowledge required to adapt to game circumstances is gathered automatically by the game AI, and is exploited immediately (i.e., without trials and without resource-intensive learning) to evoke effective behavior in a controlled manner in online play. We performed experiments that test case-based adaptive game AI on three different maps in a commercial real-time strategy (RTS) game. From our results, we may conclude that case-based adaptive game AI provides a strong basis for effectively adapting game AI in video games.",

    "title": "The LuxS family of bacterial autoinducers: biosynthesis of a novel quorum‐sensing signal molecule",
    "abstract": "Many bacteria control gene expression in response to cell population density, and this phenomenon is called quorum sensing. In Gram‐negative bacteria, quorum sensing typically involves the production, release and detection of acylated homoserine lactone signalling molecules called autoinducers. Vibrio harveyi, a Gram‐negative bioluminescent marine bacterium, regulates light production in response to two distinct autoinducers (AI‐1 and AI‐2). AI‐1 is a homoserine lactone. The structure of AI‐2 is not known. We have suggested previously that V. harveyi uses AI‐1 for intraspecies communication and AI‐2 for interspecies communication. Consistent with this idea, we have shown that many species of Gram‐negative and Gram‐positive bacteria produce AI‐2 and, in every case, production of AI‐2 is dependent on the function encoded by the luxS gene. We show here that LuxS is the AI‐2 synthase and that AI‐2 is produced from S‐adenosylmethionine in three enzymatic steps. The substrate for LuxS is S‐ribosylhomocysteine, which is cleaved to form two products, one of which is homocysteine, and the other is AI‐2. In this report, we also provide evidence that the biosynthetic pathway and biochemical intermediates in AI‐2 biosynthesis are identical in Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhimurium, V. harveyi, Vibrio cholerae and Enterococcus faecalis. This result suggests that, unlike quorum sensing via the family of related homoserine lactone autoinducers, AI‐2 is a unique, ‘universal’ signal that could be used by a variety of bacteria for communication among and between species.",

    "title": "Artificial intelligence in cancer imaging: Clinical challenges and applications",
    "abstract": "Judgement, as one of the core tenets of medicine, relies upon the integration of multilayered data with nuanced decision making. Cancer offers a unique context for medical decisions given not only its variegated forms with evolution of disease but also the need to take into account the individual condition of patients, their ability to receive treatment, and their responses to treatment. Challenges remain in the accurate detection, characterization, and monitoring of cancers despite improved technologies. Radiographic assessment of disease most commonly relies upon visual evaluations, the interpretations of which may be augmented by advanced computational analyses. In particular, artificial intelligence (AI) promises to make great strides in the qualitative interpretation of cancer imaging by expert clinicians, including volumetric delineation of tumors over time, extrapolation of the tumor genotype and biological course from its radiographic phenotype, prediction of clinical outcome, and assessment of the impact of disease and treatment on adjacent organs. AI may automate processes in the initial interpretation of images and shift the clinical workflow of radiographic detection, management decisions on whether or not to administer an intervention, and subsequent observation to a yet to be envisioned paradigm. Here, the authors review the current state of AI as applied to medical imaging of cancer and describe advances in 4 tumor types (lung, brain, breast, and prostate) to illustrate how common clinical problems are being addressed. Although most studies evaluating AI applications in oncology to date have not been vigorously validated for reproducibility and generalizability, the results do highlight increasingly concerted efforts in pushing AI technology to clinical use and to impact future directions in cancer care.",

    "abstract": "Along with the rapid developments in communication technologies and the surge in the use of mobile devices, a brand-new computation paradigm, edge computing, is surging in popularity. Meanwhile, the artificial intelligence (AI) applications are thriving with the breakthroughs in deep learning and the many improvements in hardware architectures. Billions of data bytes, generated at the network edge, put massive demands on data processing and structural optimization. Thus, there exists a strong demand to integrate edge computing and AI, which gives birth to edge intelligence. In this article, we divide edge intelligence into AI for edge (intelligence-enabled edge computing) and AI on edge (artificial intelligence on edge). The former focuses on providing more optimal solutions to key problems in edge computing with the help of popular and effective AI technologies while the latter studies how to carry out the entire process of building AI models, i.e., model training and inference, on the edge. This article provides insights into this new interdisciplinary field from a broader perspective. It discusses the core concepts and the research roadmap, which should provide the necessary background for potential future research initiatives in edge intelligence.",

    "title": "Bacteria–host communication: The language of hormones",
    "abstract": "The interbacterial communication system known as quorum sensing (QS) utilizes hormone-like compounds referred to as autoinducers to regulate bacterial gene expression. Enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) serotype O157:H7 is the agent responsible for outbreaks of bloody diarrhea in several countries. We previously proposed that EHEC uses a QS regulatory system to “sense” that it is within the intestine and activate genes essential for intestinal colonization. The QS system used by EHEC is the LuxS/autoinducer 2 (AI-2) system extensively involved in interspecies communication. The autoinducer AI-2 is a furanosyl borate diester whose synthesis depends on the enzyme LuxS. Here we show that an EHEC luxS mutant, unable to produce the bacterial autoinducer, still responds to a eukaryotic cell signal to activate expression of its virulence genes. We have identified this signal as the hormone epinephrine and show that β- and α-adrenergic antagonists can block the bacterial response to this hormone. Furthermore, using purified and in vitro synthesized AI-2 we showed that AI-2 is not the autoinducer involved in the bacterial signaling. EHEC produces another, previously undescribed autoinducer (AI-3) whose synthesis depends on the presence of LuxS. These results imply a potential cross-communication between the luxS/AI-3 bacterial QS system and the epinephrine host signaling system. Given that eukaryotic cell-to-cell signaling typically occurs through hormones, and that bacterial cell-to-cell signaling occurs through QS, we speculate that QS might be a “language” by which bacteria and host cells communicate.",

    "title": "Artificial Intelligence in Dentistry: Chances and Challenges",
    "abstract": "The term “artificial intelligence” (AI) refers to the idea of machines being capable of performing human tasks. A subdomain of AI is machine learning (ML), which “learns” intrinsic statistical patterns in data to eventually cast predictions on unseen data. Deep learning is a ML technique using multi-layer mathematical operations for learning and inferring on complex data like imagery. This succinct narrative review describes the application, limitations and possible future of AI-based dental diagnostics, treatment planning, and conduct, for example, image analysis, prediction making, record keeping, as well as dental research and discovery. AI-based applications will streamline care, relieving the dental workforce from laborious routine tasks, increasing health at lower costs for a broader population, and eventually facilitate personalized, predictive, preventive, and participatory dentistry. However, AI solutions have not by large entered routine dental practice, mainly due to 1) limited data availability, accessibility, structure, and comprehensiveness, 2) lacking methodological rigor and standards in their development, 3) and practical questions around the value and usefulness of these solutions, but also ethics and responsibility. Any AI application in dentistry should demonstrate tangible value by, for example, improving access to and quality of care, increasing efficiency and safety of services, empowering and enabling patients, supporting medical research, or increasing sustainability. Individual privacy, rights, and autonomy need to be put front and center; a shift from centralized to distributed/federated learning may address this while improving scalability and robustness. Lastly, trustworthiness into, and generalizability of, dental AI solutions need to be guaranteed; the implementation of continuous human oversight and standards grounded in evidence-based dentistry should be expected. Methods to visualize, interpret, and explain the logic behind AI solutions will contribute (“explainable AI”). Dental education will need to accompany the introduction of clinical AI solutions by fostering digital literacy in the future dental workforce.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) continues to garner substantial interest in medical imaging. The potential applications are vast and include the entirety of the medical imaging life cycle from image creation to diagnosis to outcome prediction. The chief obstacles to development and clinical implementation of AI algorithms include availability of sufficiently large, curated, and representative training data that includes expert labeling (eg, annotations). Current supervised AI methods require a curation process for data to optimally train, validate, and test algorithms. Currently, most research groups and industry have limited data access based on small sample sizes from small geographic areas. In addition, the preparation of data is a costly and time-intensive process, the results of which are algorithms with limited utility and poor generalization. In this article, the authors describe fundamental steps for preparing medical imaging data in AI algorithm development, explain current limitations to data curation, and explore new approaches to address the problem of data availability.",

    "abstract": "This is an opinion piece about the relationship between the fields of human-computer interaction (HCI), and artificial intelligence (AI). The ultimate goal of both fields is to make user interfaces more effective and easier to use for people. But historically, they have disagreed about whether \"intelligence\" or \"direct manipulation\" is the better route to achieving this. There is an unjustified perception in HCI that AI is unreliable. There is an unjustified perception in AI that interfaces are merely cosmetic. This disagreement is counterproductive. This article argues that AI's goals of intelligent interfaces would benefit enormously by the user-centered design and testing principles of HCI. It argues that HCI's stated goals of meeting the needs of users and interacting in natural ways, would be best served by application of AI. Peace.",

    "abstract": "We present an AI-based solution approach to the transit network design problem (TNDP). Past approaches fall into three categories: optimization formulations of idealized situations, heuristic approaches, or practical guidelines and ad hoc procedures reflecting the professional judgement and practical experience of transit planners. We discuss the sources of complexity of the TNDP as well as the shortcomings of the previous approaches. This discussion motivates the need for AI search techniques that implement the existing designer's knowledge and expertise to achieve better solutions efficiently. Then we propose a hybrid solution approach that incorporates the knowledge and expertise of transit network planners and implements efficient search techniques using AI tools, algorithmic procedures developed by others, and modules for tools implemented in conventional languages. The three major components of the solution approach are presented, namely, the lisp-implemented route generation design algorithm (RGA), the analysis procedure TRUST (Transit Route Analysis), and the route improvement algorithm (RIA). An example illustration is included.",

    "title": "Quorum Sensing in Escherichia coli Is Signaled by AI-2/LsrR: Effects on Small RNA and Biofilm Architecture",
    "abstract": "ABSTRACT The regulatory network for the uptake of Escherichia coli autoinducer 2 (AI-2) is comprised of a transporter complex, LsrABCD; its repressor, LsrR; and a cognate signal kinase, LsrK. This network is an integral part of the AI-2 quorum-sensing (QS) system. Because LsrR and LsrK directly regulate AI-2 uptake, we hypothesized that they might play a wider role in regulating other QS-related cellular functions. In this study, we characterized physiological changes due to the genomic deletion of lsrR and lsrK. We discovered that many genes were coregulated by lsrK and lsrR but in a distinctly different manner than that for the lsr operon (where LsrR serves as a repressor that is derepressed by the binding of phospho-AI-2 to the LsrR protein). An extended model for AI-2 signaling that is consistent with all current data on AI-2, LuxS, and the LuxS regulon is proposed. Additionally, we found that both the quantity and architecture of biofilms were regulated by this distinct mechanism, as lsrK and lsrR knockouts behaved identically. Similar biofilm architectures probably resulted from the concerted response of a set of genes including flu and wza, the expression of which is influenced by lsrRK. We also found for the first time that the generation of several small RNAs (including DsrA, which was previously linked to QS systems in Vibrio harveyi) was affected by LsrR. Our results suggest that AI-2 is indeed a QS signal in E. coli, especially when it acts through the transcriptional regulator LsrR.",

    "abstract": "The increased relevance of social media in our daily life has been accompanied by efforts to manipulate online conversations and opinions. Deceptive social bots -- automated or semi-automated accounts designed to impersonate humans -- have been successfully exploited for these kinds of abuse. Researchers have responded by developing AI tools to arm the public in the fight against social bots. Here we review the literature on different types of bots, their impact, and detection methods. We use the case study of Botometer, a popular bot detection tool developed at Indiana University, to illustrate how people interact with AI countermeasures. A user experience survey suggests that bot detection has become an integral part of the social media experience for many users. However, barriers in interpreting the output of AI tools can lead to fundamental misunderstandings. The arms race between machine learning methods to develop sophisticated bots and effective countermeasures makes it necessary to update the training data and features of detection tools. We again use the Botometer case to illustrate both algorithmic and interpretability improvements of bot scores, designed to meet user expectations. We conclude by discussing how future AI developments may affect the fight between malicious bots and the public.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT Advances in artificial intelligence (AI) have attracted great attention from researchers and practitioners and have opened up a broad range of beneficial opportunities for AI usage in the public sector. Against this background, there is an emerging need for a holistic understanding of the range and impact of AI-based applications and associated challenges. However, previous research considers AI applications and challenges only in isolation and fragmentarily. Given the lack of a comprehensive overview of AI-based applications and challenges for the public sector, our conceptual approach analyzes and compiles relevant insights from scientific literature to provide an integrative overview of AI applications and related challenges. Our results suggest 10 AI application areas, describing their value creation and functioning as well as specific public use cases. In addition, we identify four major dimensions of AI challenges. We finally discuss our findings, deriving implications for theory and practice and providing suggestions for future research.",

    "title": "Altering the time of the second gonadotropin-releasing hormone injection and artificial insemination (AI) during Ovsynch affects pregnancies per AI in lactating dairy cows.",
    "abstract": "Based on previous research, we hypothesized that Cosynch at 72 h [GnRH-7 d-PGF(2alpha)-72 h-GnRH + artificial insemination (AI)] would result in a greater number of pregnancies per AI (P/AI) than Cosynch at 48 h. Further, we hypothesized that P/AI would be improved to a greater extent when GnRH was administered at 56 h after PGF(2alpha) before AI at 72 h due to a more optimal interval between the LH surge and AI. Nine hundred twenty-seven lactating dairy cows (n = 1,507 AI) were blocked by pen, and pens rotated through treatments. All cows received GnRH followed 7 d later by PGF(2alpha) and then received one of the following: 1) GnRH + timed AI 48 h after PGF(2alpha) (Cosynch-48); 2) GnRH 56 h after PGF(2alpha) + timed AI 72 h after PGF(2alpha) (Ovsynch-56); or 3) GnRH + timed AI 72 h after PGF(2alpha) (Cosynch-72). Pregnancy diagnoses were performed by ultrasound at 31 to 33 d post-AI and again at 52 to 54 d post-AI. Overall P/AI were similar for the Cosynch-48 (29.2%) and Cosynch-72 (25.4%) groups. The Ovsynch-56 group had a greater P/AI (38.6%) than Cosynch-48 or Cosynch-72. Presynchronized first-service animals had greater P/AI than cows at later services in Cosynch-48 (36.2 vs. 23.0%) and Ovsynch-56 (44.8 vs. 32.7%) but not in Cosynch-72 (24.6 vs. 26.2%). Similarly, primiparous cows had greater P/AI than multiparous cows in Cosynch-48 (34.1 vs. 22.9%) and Ovsynch-56 (41.3 vs. 32.6%), but not Cosynch-72 (29.8 vs. 25.3%). In conclusion, we found no advantage to Cosynch at 72 h vs. 48 h. In contrast, we found a clear advantage to treating with GnRH at 56 h, 16 h before a 72-h AI, probably because of more-optimal timing of AI before ovulation.",

    "title": "Quorum sensing in Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhimurium, and Vibrio harveyi: a new family of genes responsible for autoinducer production.",
    "abstract": "In bacteria, the regulation of gene expression in response to changes in cell density is called quorum sensing. Quorum-sensing bacteria produce, release, and respond to hormone-like molecules (autoinducers) that accumulate in the external environment as the cell population grows. In the marine bacterium Vibrio harveyi two parallel quorum-sensing systems exist, and each is composed of a sensor-autoinducer pair. V. harveyi reporter strains capable of detecting only autoinducer 1 (AI-1) or autoinducer 2 (AI-2) have been constructed and used to show that many species of bacteria, including Escherichia coli MG1655, E. coli O157:H7, Salmonella typhimurium 14028, and S. typhimurium LT2 produce autoinducers similar or identical to the V. harveyi system 2 autoinducer AI-2. However, the domesticated laboratory strain E. coli DH5alpha does not produce this signal molecule. Here we report the identification and analysis of the gene responsible for AI-2 production in V. harveyi, S. typhimurium, and E. coli. The genes, which we have named luxSV.h., luxSS.t., and luxSE.c. respectively, are highly homologous to one another but not to any other identified gene. E. coli DH5alpha can be complemented to AI-2 production by the introduction of the luxS gene from V. harveyi or E. coli O157:H7. Analysis of the E. coli DH5alpha luxSE.c. gene shows that it contains a frameshift mutation resulting in premature truncation of the LuxSE.c. protein. Our results indicate that the luxS genes define a new family of autoinducer-production genes.",

    "abstract": "The creation of a complex web site is a thorny problem in user interface design. First, different visitors have distinct goals. Second, even a single visitor may have different needs at different times. Much of the information at the site may also be dynamic or time-dependent. Third, as the site grows and evolves, its original design may no longer be appropriate. Finally, a site may be designed for a particular purpose but used in unexpected ways. \n \nWeb servers record data about user interactions and accumulate this data over time. We believe that AI techniques can be used to examine user access logs in order to automatically improve the site. We challenge the AI community to create adaptive web sites: sites that automatically improve their organization and presentation based on user access data. \n \nSeveral unrelated research projects in plan recognition, machine learning, knowledge representation, and user modeling have begun to explore aspects of this problem. We hope that posing this challenge explicitly will bring these projects together and stimulate fundamental AI research.

As these AI-exposed establishments adopt AI, they simultaneously reduce hiring in non-AI positions and change the skill requirements of remaining postings. While visible at the establishment level, the aggregate impacts of AI-labor substitution on employment and wage growth in more exposed occupations and industries is currently too small to be detectable.",

    "abstract": "Although obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) has been studied in detail for over a decade, the mortality of this disorder is unclear. We calculated cumulative survival in 385 male OSA patients. We found that those with an apnea index (AI) greater than 20 had a much greater mortality than those with AI = less than 20. The probability of cumulative eight-year survival was .96 +/- 0.02 (SE) for AI = less than 20 vs. 63 +/- 0.17 for AI greater than 20 (p less than .05). This difference in mortality related to AI was particularly true in the patients less than 50 years of age in whom mortality from other causes is not common. None of the patients treated with tracheostomy or nasal CPAP died. Eight of the patients treated with uvulopalatopharyngoplasty (UPPP) died and the cumulative survival of the UPPP-alone treated group was not different from the survival curve of untreated OSA patients with an apnea index of greater than 20. We conclude that OSA patients with an apnea index of greater than 20 have a greater mortality than those below 20 and that UPPP patients be restudied after therapy. If the latter patients are found not to have marked amelioration of their AI, then they should be treated by nasal CPAP or tracheostomy.",

    "title": "AI-3 Synthesis Is Not Dependent on luxS in Escherichia coli",
    "abstract": "ABSTRACT The quorum-sensing (QS) signal autoinducer-2 (AI-2) has been proposed to promote interspecies signaling in a broad range of bacterial species. AI-2 is spontaneously derived from 4,5-dihydroxy-2,3-pentanedione that, along with homocysteine, is produced by cleavage of S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH) and S-ribosylhomocysteine by the Pfs and LuxS enzymes. Numerous phenotypes have been attributed to AI-2 QS signaling using luxS mutants. We have previously reported that the luxS mutation also affects the synthesis of the AI-3 autoinducer that activates enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli virulence genes. Here we show that several species of bacteria synthesize AI-3, suggesting a possible role in interspecies bacterial communication. The luxS mutation leaves the cell with only one pathway, involving oxaloacetate and l-glutamate, for de novo synthesis of homocysteine. The exclusive use of this pathway for homocysteine production appears to alter metabolism in the luxS mutant, leading to decreased levels of AI-3. The addition of aspartate and expression of an aromatic amino acid transporter, as well as a tyrosine-specific transporter, restored AI-3-dependent phenotypes in an luxS mutant. The defect in AI-3 production, but not in AI-2 production, in the luxS mutant was restored by expressing the Pseudomonas aeruginosa S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase that synthesizes homocysteine directly from SAH. Furthermore, phenotype microarrays revealed that the luxS mutation caused numerous metabolic deficiencies, while AI-3 signaling had little effect on metabolism. This study examines how AI-3 production is affected by the luxS mutation and explores the roles of the LuxS/AI-2 system in metabolism and QS.",

    "abstract": "Many bacterial species respond to the quorum‐sensing signal autoinducer‐2 (AI‐2) by regulating different niche‐specific genes. Here, we show that Sinorhizobium meliloti, a plant symbiont lacking the gene for the AI‐2 synthase, while not capable of producing AI‐2 can nonetheless respond to AI‐2 produced by other species. We demonstrate that S. meliloti has a periplasmic binding protein that binds AI‐2. The crystal structure of this protein (here named SmlsrB) with its ligand reveals that it binds (2R,4S)‐2‐methyl‐2,3,3,4‐tetrahydroxytetrahydrofuran (R‐THMF), the identical AI‐2 isomer recognized by LsrB of Salmonella typhimurium. The gene encoding SmlsrB is in an operon with orthologues of the lsr genes required for AI‐2 internalization in enteric bacteria. Accordingly, S. meliloti internalizes exogenous AI‐2, and mutants in this operon are defective in AI‐2 internalization. S. meliloti does not gain a metabolic benefit from internalizing AI‐2, suggesting that AI‐2 functions as a signal in S. meliloti. Furthermore, S. meliloti can completely eliminate the AI‐2 secreted by Erwinia carotovora, a plant pathogen shown to use AI‐2 to regulate virulence. Our findings suggest that S. meliloti is capable of ‘eavesdropping’ on the AI‐2 signalling of other species and interfering with AI‐2‐regulated behaviours such as virulence.",

    "title": "Current Challenges and Future Opportunities for XAI in Machine Learning-Based Clinical Decision Support Systems: A Systematic Review",
    "abstract": "Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence (AI) more broadly have great immediate and future potential for transforming almost all aspects of medicine. However, in many applications, even outside medicine, a lack of transparency in AI applications has become increasingly problematic. This is particularly pronounced where users need to interpret the output of AI systems. Explainable AI (XAI) provides a rationale that allows users to understand why a system has produced a given output. The output can then be interpreted within a given context. One area that is in great need of XAI is that of Clinical Decision Support Systems (CDSSs). These systems support medical practitioners in their clinic decision-making and in the absence of explainability may lead to issues of under or over-reliance. Providing explanations for how recommendations are arrived at will allow practitioners to make more nuanced, and in some cases, life-saving decisions. The need for XAI in CDSS, and the medical field in general, is amplified by the need for ethical and fair decision-making and the fact that AI trained with historical data can be a reinforcement agent of historical actions and biases that should be uncovered. We performed a systematic literature review of work to-date in the application of XAI in CDSS. Tabular data processing XAI-enabled systems are the most common, while XAI-enabled CDSS for text analysis are the least common in literature. There is more interest in developers for the provision of local explanations, while there was almost a balance between post-hoc and ante-hoc explanations, as well as between model-specific and model-agnostic techniques. Studies reported benefits of the use of XAI such as the fact that it could enhance decision confidence for clinicians, or generate the hypothesis about causality, which ultimately leads to increased trustworthiness and acceptability of the system and potential for its incorporation in the clinical workflow. However, we found an overall distinct lack of application of XAI in the context of CDSS and, in particular, a lack of user studies exploring the needs of clinicians. We propose some guidelines for the implementation of XAI in CDSS and explore some opportunities, challenges, and future research needs.",

    "title": "Supply chain risk management and artificial intelligence: state of the art and future research directions",
    "abstract": "Supply chain risk management (SCRM) encompasses a wide variety of strategies aiming to identify, assess, mitigate and monitor unexpected events or conditions which might have an impact, mostly adverse, on any part of a supply chain. SCRM strategies often depend on rapid and adaptive decision-making based on potentially large, multidimensional data sources. These characteristics make SCRM a suitable application area for artificial intelligence (AI) techniques. The aim of this paper is to provide a comprehensive review of supply chain literature that addresses problems relevant to SCRM using approaches that fall within the AI spectrum. To that end, an investigation is conducted on the various definitions and classifications of supply chain risk and related notions such as uncertainty. Then, a mapping study is performed to categorise existing literature according to the AI methodology used, ranging from mathematical programming to Machine Learning and Big Data Analytics, and the specific SCRM task they address (identification, assessment or response). Finally, a comprehensive analysis of each category is provided to identify missing aspects and unexplored areas and propose directions for future research at the confluence of SCRM and AI.",

    "title": "AI for Game Developers",
    "abstract": "Advances in 3D visualization and physics-based simulation technology make it possible for game developers to create compelling, visually immersive gaming environments that were only dreamed of years ago. But today's game players have grown in sophistication along with the games they play. It's no longer enough to wow your players with dazzling graphics; the next step in creating even more immersive games is improved artificial intelligence, or AI. Fortunately, advanced AI game techniques are within the grasp of every game developer--not just those who dedicate their careers to AI. If you're new to game programming or if you're an experienced game programmer who needs to get up to speed quickly on AI techniques, you'll find AI for Game Developers to be the perfect starting point for understanding and applying AI techniques to your games. Written for the novice AI programmer, AI for Game Developers introduces you to techniques such as finite state machines, fuzzy logic, neural networks, and many others, in straightforward, easy-to-understand language, supported with code samples throughout the entire book (written in C/C++). From basic techniques such as chasing and evading, pattern movement, and flocking to genetic algorithms, the book presents a mix of deterministic (traditional) and non-deterministic (newer) AI techniques aimed squarely at beginners AI developers. Other topics covered in the book include: Potential function based movements: a technique that handles chasing, evading swarming, and collision avoidance simultaneouslyBasic pathfinding and waypoints, including an entire chapter devoted to the A* pathfinding algorithmAI scriptingRule-based AI: learn about variants other than fuzzy logic and finite state machinesBasic probabilityBayesian techniques Unlike other books on the subject, AI for Game Developers doesn't attempt to cover every aspect of game AI, but to provide you with usable, advanced techniques you can apply to your games right now. If you've wanted to use AI to extend the play-life of your games, make them more challenging, and most importantly, make them more fun, then this book is for you.",

    "abstract": "In April 2021, the European Commission proposed a Regulation on Artificial Intelligence, known as the AI Act. We present an overview of the Act and analyse its implications, drawing on scholarship ranging from the study of contemporary AI practices to the structure of EU product safety regimes over the last four decades. Aspects of the AI Act, such as different rules for different risk-levels of AI, make sense. But we also find that some provisions of the draft AI Act have surprising legal implications, whilst others may be largely ineffective at achieving their stated goals. Several overarching aspects, including the enforcement regime and the effect of maximum harmonisation on the space for AI policy more generally, engender significant concern. These issues should be addressed as a priority in the legislative process.",

    "abstract": "ion of the learning environment Many systems attempt to provide instruction by simulating a realistic working environment in which the student can learn the task. There are many reasons for developing such systems, including the possible danger of training using the actual equipment and the lack of domain experts who can devote their expensive time to training novices. Therefore, a realistic simulated learning environment can reduce both the cost and the risks of training. An example of a simulation-based ITS is the Advanced Cardiac Life Support (ACLS) Tutor [9] in which a student takes the role of team leader in providing emergency life support for patients who have had heart attacks. The system not only monitors student actions, but runs a realistic simulation of the patient's condition and maintains an environment that is reasonably faithful to the ``real life'' situation. Thus, the goal is not only to test the student's knowledge about the correct emergency procedures, but also to allow him to experience practicing those procedures in a more realistic manner than is possible in a traditional classroom. Some systems take a less rigorous approach to representing the environment; the situations presented are similar to the real world scenarios in which the knowledge could be applied, but they are not exact simulations. Smithtown [25] takes this approach by providing a simulated setting for students to test hypotheses about economics. However, the underlying model of the environment is not an exact simulation of how the laws of economics would be applied in the real world. Another example of such a system is the Design for Manufacturing Tutor [10]. At the extreme opposite of the simulation based tutors are those that teach knowledge in a decontextualized manner without attempting to simulate the real world. Many systems throughout the history of ITS research fall into this category [2, 24]. These systems provide problems for the learner to solve without trying to connect those problems to a real world situation and are designed to teach abstract knowledge that can be transferred to multiple problem solving situations. Emphasis of Instruction There is a long history of classifying instructional goals according to the type of knowledge being taught. An important early attempt at this classification is Bloom's taxonomy [4] and much recent work in categorizing knowledge has been derived from this. In addition to classifying learning goals by knowledge type, one can also examine what the student will be able to do upon completion of the ITS's lesson. This can vary from the student being able to perform a set of skills in a manner similar to an expert to understanding abstract concepts such as Newton's third law. For ease of development, systems tend to concentrate on teaching one type of knowledge. The most common type of ITS teaches procedural skills; the goal is for students to learn how to perform a particular task. There has been substantial research in cognitive psychology about human skill acquisition, so analyzing the domain knowledge in this framework can prove beneficial to instruction. Systems that are designed according to these principles are often called cognitive tutors. The most common result of this analysis is a set of rules that are part of a runnable expert model. This set of expert rules often serves double duty as a knowledge of the domain and as the pedagogical module. If a student encounters difficulty, the specific remediation required can be determined from the expert model. Page 3 of 11 Applications of AI in Education 5/3/2005 http://www.acm.org/crossroads/xrds3-1/aied.html An example of a ``cognitive tutor'' is SHERLOCK, which has tutorial actions associated with each state in the ``effective problem space'' [14]. Another example of an ITS that uses an analysis of expert behavior is the LISP tutor [3], which encodes expert problem solvers' actions as production rules, and attempts to determine which rules the student is having difficulty applying. Other ITSs concentrate on teaching concepts and ``mental models'' to students. These systems encounter two main difficulties. First, a more substantial domain knowledge is needed for instruction. Second, since learning concepts and frameworks is less well understood than learning procedures, there is less cognitive theory to guide knowledge representation and the pedagogical module. For these reasons, ITSs of this type require a larger domain knowledge base and are sometimes referred to as knowledge based tutors. As a result of not having a strong model of skill acquisition or expert performance, these systems are forced to use general teaching strategies. They also place more emphasis on the communication and presentation system in order to achieve learning gains. An example of such a system is the Pedagogical Explanation Generation (PEG) system [27] which has an explanation planning component that uses a substantial domain knowledge base to construct answers to student queries in the domain of electrical circuits. These classifications are really points along a continuum, and serve as good rules of thumb rather than a definitive method of classifying intelligent tutors. A system that does not fall into either of these categories is Coach [31], which teaches how to use UNIX mail. This is a procedural skill, and hence cognitive in nature. However, the emphasis of this system is also knowledge based and involves generating explanations and using general pedagogical tactics for generating feedback. Generally, tutors that teach procedural skills use a cognitive task analysis of expert behavior, while tutors that teach concepts and frameworks use a larger knowledge base and place more emphasis on communication to be effective during instruction. There are exceptions to these rules, but they serve as useful guidelines for classifying ITSs.",

    "title": "HIV transmission risk through anal intercourse: systematic review, meta-analysis and implications for HIV prevention",
    "abstract": "Background The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infectiousness of anal intercourse (AI) has not been systematically reviewed, despite its role driving HIV epidemics among men who have sex with men (MSM) and its potential contribution to heterosexual spread. We assessed the per-act and per-partner HIV transmission risk from AI exposure for heterosexuals and MSM and its implications for HIV prevention. Methods Systematic review and meta-analysis of the literature on HIV-1 infectiousness through AI was conducted. PubMed was searched to September 2008. A binomial model explored the individual risk of HIV infection with and without highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). Results A total of 62 643 titles were searched; four publications reporting per-act and 12 reporting per-partner transmission estimates were included. Overall, random effects model summary estimates were 1.4% [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.2–2.5)] and 40.4% (95% CI 6.0–74.9) for per-act and per-partner unprotected receptive AI (URAI), respectively. There was no significant difference between per-act risks of URAI for heterosexuals and MSM. Per-partner unprotected insertive AI (UIAI) and combined URAI–UIAI risk were 21.7% (95% CI 0.2–43.3) and 39.9% (95% CI 22.5–57.4), respectively, with no available per-act estimates. Per-partner combined URAI–UIAI summary estimates, which adjusted for additional exposures other than AI with a ‘main’ partner [7.9% (95% CI 1.2–14.5)], were lower than crude (unadjusted) estimates [48.1% (95% CI 35.3–60.8)]. Our modelling demonstrated that it would require unreasonably low numbers of AI HIV exposures per partnership to reconcile the summary per-act and per-partner estimates, suggesting considerable variability in AI infectiousness between and within partnerships over time. AI may substantially increase HIV transmission risk even if the infected partner is receiving HAART; however, predictions are highly sensitive to infectiousness assumptions based on viral load. Conclusions Unprotected AI is a high-risk practice for HIV transmission, probably with substantial variation in infectiousness. The significant heterogeneity between infectiousness estimates means that pooled AI HIV transmission probabilities should be used with caution. Recent reported rises in AI among heterosexuals suggest a greater understanding of the role AI plays in heterosexual sex lives may be increasingly important for HIV prevention.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Artificial intelligence (AI) and other AI-based applications are being integrated into firms’ human resource management (HRM) approaches for managing people in domestic and international organisations. The last decade has seen a growth in AI-based applications proliferating the HRM function, triggering an exciting new stream of research on topics such as the social presence of AI and robotics, effects of AI adoption on individual and business level outcomes, and evaluating AI-enabled HRM practices. Adopting these technologies has resulted in how work is organised in local and international firms, noting opportunities for employees and firms’ resource utilisation, decision-making, and problem-solving. However, despite a growing interest in scholarship, research on AI-based technologies for HRM is limited and fragmented. Further research is needed that analyses the role of AI-assisted applications in HRM functions and human-AI interactions in large multinational enterprises diffusing such innovations. In response to these combined issues—the fragmented nature of research and limited extant literature, we present a systematic review on the theme of this special issue and offer a nuanced understating of what is known, yet to be known, and future research directions to frame a future research agenda for international HRM. We develop a conceptual framework that integrates research on AI applications in HRM and offers a cohesive base for future research endeavours. We also develop a set of testable propositions that serve as directions for future research.",

We used mice genetically deficient in SR-AI/II and their wild-type C57BL/6 counterparts to investigate the contribution of this receptor to defense against pneumococcal infection and inhaled particles. SR-AI/II deficiency caused impaired phagocytosis of fluorescent bacteria in vivo, diminished clearance of live bacteria from the lungs, and substantially increased pneumonic inflammation. Survival studies also showed increased mortality in SR-AI/II-deficient mice with pneumococcal lung infection. Similarly, after challenge of the airways with TiO(2) particles, SR-AI/II-deficient mice showed increased proinflammatory cytokine levels in lung lavage fluid and a more pronounced neutrophilic inflammation. The data indicate that the lung macrophage class A scavenger receptor SR-AI/II contributes to innate defense against bacteria and inhaled particles.",

    "title": "Edge Computing with Artificial Intelligence: A Machine Learning Perspective",
    "abstract": "Recent years have witnessed the widespread popularity of Internet of things (IoT). By providing sufficient data for model training and inference, IoT has promoted the development of artificial intelligence (AI) to a great extent. Under this background and trend, the traditional cloud computing model may nevertheless encounter many problems in independently tackling the massive data generated by IoT and meeting corresponding practical needs. In response, a new computing model called edge computing (EC) has drawn extensive attention from both industry and academia. With the continuous deepening of the research on EC, however, scholars have found that traditional (non-AI) methods have their limitations in enhancing the performance of EC. Seeing the successful application of AI in various fields, EC researchers start to set their sights on AI, especially from a perspective of machine learning, a branch of AI that has gained increased popularity in the past decades. In this article, we first explain the formal definition of EC and the reasons why EC has become a favorable computing model. Then, we discuss the problems of interest in EC. We summarize the traditional solutions and hightlight their limitations. By explaining the research results of using AI to optimize EC and applying AI to other fields under the EC architecture, this article can serve as a guide to explore new research ideas in these two aspects while enjoying the mutually beneficial relationship between AI and EC.",

    "abstract": "5G cellular networks are assumed to be the key enabler and infrastructure provider in the ICT industry, by offering a variety of services with diverse requirements. The standardization of 5G cellular networks is being expedited, which also implies more of the candidate technologies will be adopted. Therefore, it is worthwhile to provide insight into the candidate techniques as a whole and examine the design philosophy behind them. In this article, we try to highlight one of the most fundamental features among the revolutionary techniques in the 5G era, i.e., there emerges initial intelligence in nearly every important aspect of cellular networks, including radio resource management, mobility management, service provisioning management, and so on. However, faced with ever-increasingly complicated configuration issues and blossoming new service requirements, it is still insufficient for 5G cellular networks if it lacks complete AI functionalities. Hence, we further introduce fundamental concepts in AI and discuss the relationship between AI and the candidate techniques in 5G cellular networks. Specifically, we highlight the opportunities and challenges to exploit AI to achieve intelligent 5G networks, and demonstrate the effectiveness of AI to manage and orchestrate cellular network resources. We envision that AI-empowered 5G cellular networks will make the acclaimed ICT enabler a reality.",

    "title": "An alternative AI breeding protocol for dairy cows exposed to elevated ambient temperatures before or after calving or both.",
    "abstract": "Our objective was to determine if a timed artificial insemination (AI) protocol (Ovsynch) might produce greater pregnancy rates than AI after a synchronized, detected estrus during summer. Lactating Holstein cows (n = 425) were grouped into breeding clusters and then assigned randomly to each of two protocols for AI between 50 and 70 days in milk. All cows were treated with GnRH followed 7 d later by PGF2alpha. Ovsynch cows then were treated with a second injection of GnRH 48 h after PGF2alpha and inseminated 16 to 19 h later. Controls received no further treatment after PGF2alpha and were inseminated after detected estrus. Pregnancy was diagnosed once by transrectal ultrasonography (27 to 30 d after AI) and again by palpation (40 to 50 d). Based on concentrations of progesterone in blood collected before each hormonal injection, only 85.4% of 425 cows were considered to be cycling. Although conception rates were not different between protocols at d 27 to 30, AI submission rates and pregnancy rates were greater after Ovsynch (timed AI) than after detected estrus. A temperature-humidity index > or = 72 was associated with fewer controls detected in estrus with lower conception than for controls detected in estrus when index values were < 72, whereas the reverse was true for cows after the Ovsynch protocol. We concluded that a timed AI protocol increased pregnancy rates at d 27 to 30 because its success was independent of either expression or detection of estrus. However, because of poorer embryonic survival in Ovsynch cows during heat stress only (39.5 vs. 69.2% survival for Ovsynch and control, respectively), pregnancy rates were not different by d 40 to 50 after timed AI.",

    "abstract": "With the rapid development of smart terminals and infrastructures, as well as diversified applications (e.g., virtual and augmented reality, remote surgery and holographic projection) with colorful requirements, current networks (e.g., 4G and upcoming 5G networks) may not be able to completely meet quickly rising traffic demands. Accordingly, efforts from both industry and academia have already been put to the research on 6G networks. Recently, artificial intelligence (Ai) has been utilized as a new paradigm for the design and optimization of 6G networks with a high level of intelligence. Therefore, this article proposes an Ai-enabled intelligent architecture for 6G networks to realize knowledge discovery, smart resource management, automatic network adjustment and intelligent service provisioning, where the architecture is divided into four layers: intelligent sensing layer, data mining and analytics layer, intelligent control layer and smart application layer. We then review and discuss the applications of Ai techniques for 6G networks and elaborate how to employ the Ai techniques to efficiently and effectively optimize the network performance, including Ai-empowered mobile edge computing, intelligent mobility and handover management, and smart spectrum management. We highlight important future research directions and potential solutions for Ai-enabled intelligent 6G networks, including computation efficiency, algorithms robustness, hardware development and energy management.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) helps companies offer important benefits to consumers, such as health monitoring with wearable devices, advice with recommender systems, peace of mind with smart household products, and convenience with voice-activated virtual assistants. However, although AI can be seen as a neutral tool to be evaluated on efficiency and accuracy, this approach does not consider the social and individual challenges that can occur when AI is deployed. This research aims to bridge these two perspectives: on one side, the authors acknowledge the value that embedding AI technology into products and services can provide to consumers. On the other side, the authors build on and integrate sociological and psychological scholarship to examine some of the costs consumers experience in their interactions with AI. In doing so, the authors identify four types of consumer experiences with AI: (1) data capture, (2) classification, (3) delegation, and (4) social. This approach allows the authors to discuss policy and managerial avenues to address the ways in which consumers may fail to experience value in organizations’ investments into AI and to lay out an agenda for future research.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to perform a national survey on occasionally discovered adrenal masses [adrenal incidentalomas (AI)] under the auspices of the Italian Society of Endocrinology. This multicentric and retrospective evaluation of patients with AI includes 1096 cases collected in 26 centers between 1980 and 1995. Relevant information was obtained by means of a specifically tailored questionnaire. Of the 1096 forms received, 1004 were retained for final analysis. Patients were 420 males and 584 females, aged between 15-86 yr (median, 58 yr). Mass size (computed tomography measurement) ranged from 0.5-25 cm (median, 3.0 cm). Hormonal work-up demonstrated that 85% of the masses were nonhypersecretory, 9.2% were defined as subclinical Cushing's syndrome, 4.2% were pheochromocytomas, and 1.6% were aldosteronomas. Adrenalectomy was performed in 380 patients with removal of 198 cortical adenomas (52%), 47 cortical carcinomas (12%), 42 pheochromocytomas (11%), and other less frequent tumor types. Patients with carcinoma were significantly younger than patients with adenoma (median, 46; range, 17-84; vs. 57, 16-83 yr; P = 0.05). Adenomas were significantly smaller than carcinomas (3.5, 1-15 vs. 7.5, 2.6-25 cm; P < 0.001), and a cut-off at 4.0 cm had the highest sensitivity (93%) in differentiating between benign and malignant tumors. Hormonal work-up of patients with subclinical Cushing's syndrome showed low baseline ACTH in 79%, cortisol unsuppressibility after 1 mg dexamethasone in 73%, above normal urinary free cortisol in 75%, disturbed cortisol rhythm in 43%, and blunted ACTH response to CRH in 55%. Only 43% of patients with pheochromocytoma were hypertensive, and 86% showed elevated urinary catecholamines. All patients with aldosteronoma were hypertensive and had suppressed upright PRA. These results indicate that mass size is the most reliable variable in separating benign from malignant AI. Adrenalectomy should be recommended for AI greater than 4.0 cm because of the increased risk of malignancy, especially in young patients. Endocrine evaluation should be performed in all patients to identify silent states of hormone excess.",

That is leading to a new conscientiousness about research methods and publication protocols. Last week, at a meeting of the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence in New Orleans, Louisiana, reproducibility was on the agenda, with some teams diagnosing the problem—and one laying out tools to mitigate it.",

    "title": "Empowering Things With Intelligence: A Survey of the Progress, Challenges, and Opportunities in Artificial Intelligence of Things",
    "abstract": "In the Internet-of-Things (IoT) era, billions of sensors and devices collect and process data from the environment, transmit them to cloud centers, and receive feedback via the Internet for connectivity and perception. However, transmitting massive amounts of heterogeneous data, perceiving complex environments from these data, and then making smart decisions in a timely manner are difficult. Artificial intelligence (AI), especially deep learning, is now a proven success in various areas, including computer vision, speech recognition, and natural language processing. AI introduced into the IoT heralds the era of AI of things (AIoT). This article presents a comprehensive survey on AIoT to show how AI can empower the IoT to make it faster, smarter, greener, and safer. Specifically, we briefly present the AIoT architecture in the context of cloud computing, fog computing, and edge computing. Then, we present progress in AI research for IoT from four perspectives: 1) perceiving; 2) learning; 3) reasoning; and 4) behaving. Next, we summarize some promising applications of AIoT that are likely to profoundly reshape our world. Finally, we highlight the challenges facing AIoT and some potential research opportunities.",

As a result, there has been a wave of enthusiasm and activity centered on knowledge management. To make progress in this area, issues of technology, process, people, and content must be addressed. In this article, we develop a road map for knowledge management. It begins with an assessment of the current state of the practice, using examples drawn from our experience at Schlumberger. It then sketches the possible evolution of technology and practice over a 10-year period. Along the way, we highlight ways in which AI technology, present and future, can be applied in knowledge management systems.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) and people’s interactions with it—through virtual agents, socialbots, and language-generation software—do not fit neatly into paradigms of communication theory that have long focused on human–human communication. To address this disconnect between communication theory and emerging technology, this article provides a starting point for articulating the differences between communicative AI and previous technologies and introduces a theoretical basis for navigating these conditions in the form of scholarship within human–machine communication (HMC). Drawing on an HMC framework, we outline a research agenda built around three key aspects of communicative AI technologies: (1) the functional dimensions through which people make sense of these devices and applications as communicators, (2) the relational dynamics through which people associate with these technologies and, in turn, relate to themselves and others, and (3) the metaphysical implications called up by blurring ontological boundaries surrounding what constitutes human, machine, and communication.",

    "abstract": "In this article, we first survey the three major types of computer music systems based on AI techniques: (1) compositional, (2) improvisational, and (3) performance systems. Representative examples of each type are briefly described. Then, we look in more detail at the problem of endowing the resulting performances with the expressiveness that characterizes human-generated music. This is one of the most challenging aspects of computer music that has been addressed just recently. The main problem in modeling expressiveness is to grasp the performer's \"touch,\" that is, the knowledge applied when performing a score. Humans acquire it through a long process of observation and imitation. For this reason, previous approaches, based on following musical rules trying to capture interpretation knowledge, had serious limitations. An alternative approach, much closer to the observation-imitation process observed in humans, is that of directly using the interpretation knowledge implicit in examples extracted from recordings of human performers instead of trying to make explicit such knowledge. In the last part of the article, we report on a performance system, SAXEX, based on this alternative approach, that is capable of generating high-quality expressive solo performances of jazz ballads based on examples of human performers within a case-based reasoning (CBR) system.",

    "abstract": "Background In general, academic but not community endoscopists have demonstrated adequate endoscopic differentiation accuracy to make the ‘resect and discard’ paradigm for diminutive colorectal polyps workable. Computer analysis of video could potentially eliminate the obstacle of interobserver variability in endoscopic polyp interpretation and enable widespread acceptance of ‘resect and discard’. Study design and methods We developed an artificial intelligence (AI) model for real-time assessment of endoscopic video images of colorectal polyps. A deep convolutional neural network model was used. Only narrow band imaging video frames were used, split equally between relevant multiclasses. Unaltered videos from routine exams not specifically designed or adapted for AI classification were used to train and validate the model. The model was tested on a separate series of 125 videos of consecutively encountered diminutive polyps that were proven to be adenomas or hyperplastic polyps. Results The AI model works with a confidence mechanism and did not generate sufficient confidence to predict the histology of 19 polyps in the test set, representing 15% of the polyps. For the remaining 106 diminutive polyps, the accuracy of the model was 94% (95% CI 86% to 97%), the sensitivity for identification of adenomas was 98% (95% CI 92% to 100%), specificity was 83% (95% CI 67% to 93%), negative predictive value 97% and positive predictive value 90%. Conclusions An AI model trained on endoscopic video can differentiate diminutive adenomas from hyperplastic polyps with high accuracy. Additional study of this programme in a live patient clinical trial setting to address resect and discard is planned.",

    "title": "Change Detection Based on Artificial Intelligence: State-of-the-Art and Challenges",
    "abstract": "Change detection based on remote sensing (RS) data is an important method of detecting changes on the Earth’s surface and has a wide range of applications in urban planning, environmental monitoring, agriculture investigation, disaster assessment, and map revision. In recent years, integrated artificial intelligence (AI) technology has become a research focus in developing new change detection methods. Although some researchers claim that AI-based change detection approaches outperform traditional change detection approaches, it is not immediately obvious how and to what extent AI can improve the performance of change detection. This review focuses on the state-of-the-art methods, applications, and challenges of AI for change detection. Specifically, the implementation process of AI-based change detection is first introduced. Then, the data from different sensors used for change detection, including optical RS data, synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data, street view images, and combined heterogeneous data, are presented, and the available open datasets are also listed. The general frameworks of AI-based change detection methods are reviewed and analyzed systematically, and the unsupervised schemes used in AI-based change detection are further analyzed. Subsequently, the commonly used networks in AI for change detection are described. From a practical point of view, the application domains of AI-based change detection methods are classified based on their applicability. Finally, the major challenges and prospects of AI for change detection are discussed and delineated, including (a) heterogeneous big data processing, (b) unsupervised AI, and (c) the reliability of AI. This review will be beneficial for researchers in understanding this field.",

    "abstract": "The practice of medicine is changing with the development of new Artificial Intelligence (AI) methods of machine learning. Coupled with rapid improvements in computer processing, these AI-based systems are already improving the accuracy and efficiency of diagnosis and treatment across various specializations. The increasing focus of AI in radiology has led to some experts suggesting that someday AI may even replace radiologists. These suggestions raise the question of whether AI-based systems will eventually replace physicians in some specializations or will augment the role of physicians without actually replacing them. To assess the impact on physicians this research seeks to better understand this technology and how it is transforming medicine. To that end this paper researches the role of AI-based systems in performing medical work in specializations including radiology, pathology, ophthalmology, and cardiology. It concludes that AI-based systems will augment physicians and are unlikely to replace the traditional physician–patient relationship.",

As the AI research community pushes for artificial general intelligence (AGI), experimentation platforms are needed that support the development of flexible agents that learn to solve diverse tasks in complex environments. Minecraft is an ideal foundation for such a platform, as it exposes agents to complex 3D worlds, coupled with infinitely varied game-play. \n \nProject Malmo provides a sophisticated abstraction layer on top of Minecraft that supports a wide range of experimentation scenarios, ranging from navigation and survival to collaboration and problem solving tasks. In this demo we present the Malmo platform and its capabilities. The platform is publicly released as open source software at IJCAI, to support openness and collaboration in AI research.",

    "title": "Niacin, but Not Gemfibrozil, Selectively Increases LP-AI, a Cardioprotective Subfraction of HDL, in Patients With Low HDL Cholesterol",
    "abstract": "Evidence indicates that the high density lipoprotein (HDL) subfraction containing apolipoprotein A-I without apolipoprotein AII (LP-AI) is more antiatherogenic than HDL particles containing apolipoprotein A-I and apolipoprotein A-II (LP-AI+AII). This study examined the effect of extended-release niacin (niacin-ER) and gemfibrozil on LP-AI and LP-AI+AII particles in patients with low levels of HDL cholesterol (HDL-C). Mechanisms by which these agents modulate HDL particles were investigated by in vitro studies using human hepatoblastoma (Hep G2) cells. A total of 139 patients with low HDL-C (≤40 mg/dL) were randomized to niacin-ER or gemfibrozil in a multicenter double-blind trial. Patients were dose-escalated with once-nightly niacin-ER (1 to 2 g) or gemfibrozil (1.2 g) for 19 weeks. Niacin-ER had a greater effect in raising HDL-C and apolipoprotein A-I levels than did gemfibrozil. Niacin-ER at 1- and 2-g doses increased LP-AI levels by 8.7±4.0% (P =0.033) and 24.0±4.4% (P <0.001), respectively. Gemfibrozil had no consistent effect on LP-AI levels. LP-AI+AII levels increased 5% to 8% by both agents. In vitro studies showed that niacin, but not gemfibrozil, selectively decreased the uptake of 125I-labeled LP-AI holoparticles by Hep G2 cells. The uptake of [3H]cholesterol ester was ≈75% greater from LP-AI versus LP-AI+AII particles, but neither niacin nor gemfibrozil affected cholesterol ester uptake. These data indicate that unlike gemfibrozil, niacin selectively increases LP-AI compared with LP-AI+AII particle concentration in patients with low HDL-C levels. The mechanism of action of increased LP-AI concentration appears to be mediated by decreased hepatic removal of LP-AI particles, which are more efficient in reverse cholesterol transport, thus suggesting an additional mechanism by which niacin mediates its antiatherogenic properties.",

Our goal is to familiarize the reader with some of the important problems that have arisen in the design of planning systems and to discuss some of the many solutions that have been developed in the over 30 years of research in this area. In this article, we broadly cover the major ideas in the field of AI planning and show the direction in which some current research is going. We define some of the terms commonly used in the planning literature, describe some of the basic issues coming from the design of planning systems, and survey results in the area. Because such tasks are virtually never ending, and thus, any finite document must be incomplete, we provide references to connect each idea to the appropriate literature and allow readers access to the work most relevant to their own research or applications.",

    "title": "Innovation and Design in the Age of Artificial Intelligence",
    "abstract": "At the heart of any innovation process lies a fundamental practice: the way people create ideas and solve problems. This “decision making” side of innovation is what scholars and practitioners refer to as “design.” Decisions in innovation processes have so far been taken by humans. What happens when they can be substituted by machines? Artificial Intelligence (AI) brings data and algorithms to the core of the innovation processes. What are the implications of this diffusion of AI for our understanding of design and innovation? Is AI just another digital technology that, akin to many others, will not significantly question what we know about design? Or will it create transformations in design that current theoretical frameworks cannot capture? This paper proposes a framework for understanding the design and innovation in the age of AI. We discuss the implications for design and innovation theory. Specifically, we observe that, as creative problem-solving is significantly conducted by algorithms, human design increasingly becomes an activity of sensemaking, that is, understanding which problems should or could be addressed. This shift in focus calls for the new theories and brings design closer to leadership, which is, inherently, an activity of sensemaking. Our insights are derived from and illustrated with two cases at the frontier of AI—Netflix and Airbnb (com-plemented with analyses of Microsoft and Tesla)—which point to two directions for the evolution of design and innovation in firms. First, AI enables an organization to overcome many past limitations of human-intensive design processes, by improving the scalability of the process, broadening its scope across traditional boundaries, and en-hancing its ability to learn and adapt on the fly. Second, and maybe more surprising, while removing these limitations, AI also appears to deeply enact several popular design principles. AI thus reinforces the principles of Design Thinking, namely: being people-centered, abductive, and iterative. In fact, AI enables the creation of solutions that are more highly user centered than human-based approaches (i.e., to an extreme level of granularity, designed for every single person); that are potentially more creative; and that are continuously updated through learning iterations across the entire product life cycle. In sum, while AI does not undermine the basic principles of design, it profoundly changes the practice of design. Problem-solving tasks, traditionally carried out by designers, are now automated into learning loops that operate without limitations of volume and speed. The algorithms embedded in these loops think in a radically different way than a designer who handles the complex problems holistically with a systemic perspective. Algorithms instead han-dle complexity through very simple tasks, which are iterated continuously. This paper discusses the implications of these insights for design and innovation management scholars and practitioners.",

    "title": "Applications and Challenges of Implementing Artificial Intelligence in Medical Education: Integrative Review",
    "abstract": "Background Since the advent of artificial intelligence (AI) in 1955, the applications of AI have increased over the years within a rapidly changing digital landscape where public expectations are on the rise, fed by social media, industry leaders, and medical practitioners. However, there has been little interest in AI in medical education until the last two decades, with only a recent increase in the number of publications and citations in the field. To our knowledge, thus far, a limited number of articles have discussed or reviewed the current use of AI in medical education. Objective This study aims to review the current applications of AI in medical education as well as the challenges of implementing AI in medical education. Methods Medline (Ovid), EBSCOhost Education Resources Information Center (ERIC) and Education Source, and Web of Science were searched with explicit inclusion and exclusion criteria. Full text of the selected articles was analyzed using the Extension of Technology Acceptance Model and the Diffusions of Innovations theory. Data were subsequently pooled together and analyzed quantitatively. Results A total of 37 articles were identified. Three primary uses of AI in medical education were identified: learning support (n=32), assessment of students’ learning (n=4), and curriculum review (n=1). The main reasons for use of AI are its ability to provide feedback and a guided learning pathway and to decrease costs. Subgroup analysis revealed that medical undergraduates are the primary target audience for AI use. In addition, 34 articles described the challenges of AI implementation in medical education; two main reasons were identified: difficulty in assessing the effectiveness of AI in medical education and technical challenges while developing AI applications. Conclusions The primary use of AI in medical education was for learning support mainly due to its ability to provide individualized feedback. Little emphasis was placed on curriculum review and assessment of students’ learning due to the lack of digitalization and sensitive nature of examinations, respectively. Big data manipulation also warrants the need to ensure data integrity. Methodological improvements are required to increase AI adoption by addressing the technical difficulties of creating an AI application and using novel methods to assess the effectiveness of AI. To better integrate AI into the medical profession, measures should be taken to introduce AI into the medical school curriculum for medical professionals to better understand AI algorithms and maximize its use.",

    "title": "Artificial Intelligence in Utilitarian vs. Hedonic Contexts: The “Word-of-Machine” Effect",
    "abstract": "Rapid development and adoption of AI, machine learning, and natural language processing applications challenge managers and policy makers to harness these transformative technologies. In this context, the authors provide evidence of a novel “word-of-machine” effect, the phenomenon by which utilitarian/hedonic attribute trade-offs determine preference for, or resistance to, AI-based recommendations compared with traditional word of mouth, or human-based recommendations. The word-of-machine effect stems from a lay belief that AI recommenders are more competent than human recommenders in the utilitarian realm and less competent than human recommenders in the hedonic realm. As a consequence, importance or salience of utilitarian attributes determine preference for AI recommenders over human ones, and importance or salience of hedonic attributes determine resistance to AI recommenders over human ones (Studies 1–4). The word-of machine effect is robust to attribute complexity, number of options considered, and transaction costs. The word-of-machine effect reverses for utilitarian goals if a recommendation needs matching to a person’s unique preferences (Study 5) and is eliminated in the case of human–AI hybrid decision making (i.e., augmented rather than artificial intelligence; Study 6). An intervention based on the consider-the-opposite protocol attenuates the word-of-machine effect (Studies 7a–b).",

    "title": "Toward understanding the impact of artificial intelligence on labor",
    "abstract": "Rapid advances in artificial intelligence (AI) and automation technologies have the potential to significantly disrupt labor markets. While AI and automation can augment the productivity of some workers, they can replace the work done by others and will likely transform almost all occupations at least to some degree. Rising automation is happening in a period of growing economic inequality, raising fears of mass technological unemployment and a renewed call for policy efforts to address the consequences of technological change. In this paper we discuss the barriers that inhibit scientists from measuring the effects of AI and automation on the future of work. These barriers include the lack of high-quality data about the nature of work (e.g., the dynamic requirements of occupations), lack of empirically informed models of key microlevel processes (e.g., skill substitution and human–machine complementarity), and insufficient understanding of how cognitive technologies interact with broader economic dynamics and institutional mechanisms (e.g., urban migration and international trade policy). Overcoming these barriers requires improvements in the longitudinal and spatial resolution of data, as well as refinements to data on workplace skills. These improvements will enable multidisciplinary research to quantitatively monitor and predict the complex evolution of work in tandem with technological progress. Finally, given the fundamental uncertainty in predicting technological change, we recommend developing a decision framework that focuses on resilience to unexpected scenarios in addition to general equilibrium behavior.",

    "title": "Stand-Alone Artificial Intelligence for Breast Cancer Detection in Mammography: Comparison With 101 Radiologists.",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nArtificial intelligence (AI) systems performing at radiologist-like levels in the evaluation of digital mammography (DM) would improve breast cancer screening accuracy and efficiency. We aimed to compare the stand-alone performance of an AI system to that of radiologists in detecting breast cancer in DM.\n\n\nMETHODS\nNine multi-reader, multi-case study datasets previously used for different research purposes in seven countries were collected. Each dataset consisted of DM exams acquired with systems from four different vendors, multiple radiologists' assessments per exam, and ground truth verified by histopathological analysis or follow-up, yielding a total of 2652 exams (653 malignant) and interpretations by 101 radiologists (28 296 independent interpretations). An AI system analyzed these exams yielding a level of suspicion of cancer present between 1 and 10. The detection performance between the radiologists and the AI system was compared using a noninferiority null hypothesis at a margin of 0.05.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe performance of the AI system was statistically noninferior to that of the average of the 101 radiologists. The AI system had a 0.840 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.820 to 0.860) area under the ROC curve and the average of the radiologists was 0.814 (95% CI = 0.787 to 0.841) (difference 95% CI = -0.003 to 0.055). The AI system had an AUC higher than 61.4% of the radiologists.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe evaluated AI system achieved a cancer detection accuracy comparable to an average breast radiologist in this retrospective setting. Although promising, the performance and impact of such a system in a screening setting needs further investigation.",

    "title": "Artificial intelligence applications in the development of autonomous vehicles: a survey",
    "abstract": "The advancement of artificial intelligence ( AI ) has truly stimulated the development and deployment of autonomous vehicles ( AVs ) in the transportation industry. Fueled by big data from various sensing devices and advanced computing resources, AI has become an essential component of AVs for perceiving the surrounding environment and making appropriate decision in motion. To achieve goal of full automation ( i.e., self-driving ( , it is important to know how AI works in AV systems. Existing research have made great efforts in investigating different aspects of applying AI in AV development. However, few studies have offered the research community a thorough examination of current practices in implementing AI in AVs. Thus, this paper aims to shorten the gap by providing a comprehensive survey of key studies in this research avenue. Specifically, it intends to analyze their use of AIs in supporting the primary applications in AVs: 1) perception; 2) localization and mapping; and 3) decision making. It investigates the current practices to understand how AI can be used and what are the challenges and issues associated with their implementation. Based on the exploration of current practices and technology advances, this paper further provides insights into potential opportunities regarding the use of AI in conjunction with other emerging technologies: 1) high definition maps, big data, and high performance computing; 2) augmented reality( AR ) / virtual reality ( VR ) enhanced simulation platform; and 3) 5G communication for connected AVs. This paper is expected to offer a quick reference for researchers interested in understanding the use of AI in AV research.",

    "title": "Artificial Intelligence Applications for Industry 4.0: A Literature-Based Study",
    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) contributes to the recent developments in Industry 4.0. Industries are focusing on improving product consistency, productivity and reducing operating costs, and they want to achieve this with the collaborative partnership between robotics and people. In smart industries, hyperconnected manufacturing processes depend on different machines that interact using AI automation systems by capturing and interpreting all data types. Smart platforms of automation can play a decisive role in transforming modern production. AI provides appropriate information to take decision-making and alert people of possible malfunctions. Industries will use AI to process data transmitted from the Internet of things (IoT) devices and connected machines based on their desire to integrate them into their equipment. It provides companies with the ability to track their entire end-to-end activities and processes fully. This literature review-based paper aims to brief the vital role of AI in successfully implementing Industry 4.0. Accordingly, the research objectives are crafted to facilitate researchers, practitioners, students and industry professionals in this paper. First, it discusses the significant technological features and traits of AI, critical for Industry 4.0. Second, this paper identifies the significant advancements and various challenges enabling the implementation of AI for Industry 4.0. Finally, the paper identifies and discusses significant applications of AI for Industry 4.0. With an extensive review-based exploration, we see that the advantages of AI are widespread and the need for stakeholders in understanding the kind of automation platform they require in the new manufacturing order. Furthermore, this technology seeks correlations to avoid errors and eventually to anticipate them. Thus, AI technology is gradually accomplishing various goals of Industry 4.0.",

    "title": "G to A substitution in the promoter region of the apolipoprotein AI gene is associated with elevated serum apolipoprotein AI and high density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations.",
    "abstract": "We have determined the sequence of 250 bases 5' of the transcriptional start site of the apolipoprotein AI gene in a human individual with high serum concentrations of apo AI. One of the alleles contained a G to A substitution at position -75, between the CACAT sequence and the TAAATA box, creating a tandem repeat, CAGGGC-CA*GGGC. The substitution destroys an MspI cutting site, and the polymerase chain reaction and MspI digestion were used to identify the presence of the A or G base. The frequency of the A substitution in 96 healthy men from Bristol was 0.11 and this was increased to 0.25 in men with serum apo AI concentrations greater than 180 mg/dl. Men with the A allele had significantly higher serum concentrations of apo AI, high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol and HDL2 than those with the G allele. In this sample, variation associated with the G to A substitution accounted for 6% and 4.6% of the total variance in apo AI and HDL cholesterol concentrations, respectively. Although there is as yet no functional proof, it is possible that the A substitution may be having a direct positive effect on the rate of apo AI gene transcription and thus be associated with increased apo AI and HDL cholesterol concentrations because of increased production of apo AI protein from the liver or intestine.",

As reported in The New York Times and The Washington Post, this program -- a new version of Great Game Products' BRIDGE BARON program -- won the Baron Barclay World Bridge Computer Challenge, an international competition hosted in July 1997 by the American Contract Bridge League. It is well known that the game tree search techniques used in computer programs for games such as Chess and Checkers work differently from how humans think about such games. In contrast, our new version of the BRIDGE BARON emulates the way in which a human might plan declarer play in Bridge by using an adaptation of hierarchical task network planning. This article gives an overview of the planning techniques that we have incorporated into the BRIDGE BARON and discusses what the program's victory signifies for research on AI planning and game playing.",

    "title": "Adjuvant Endocrine Therapy for Women With Hormone Receptor-Positive Breast Cancer: ASCO Clinical Practice Guideline Focused Update.",
    "abstract": "PURPOSE\nTo update the ASCO clinical practice guideline on adjuvant endocrine therapy based on emerging data about the optimal duration of aromatase inhibitor (AI) treatment.\n\n\nMETHODS\nASCO conducted a systematic review of randomized clinical trials from 2012 to 2018. Guideline recommendations were based on the Panel's review of the evidence from six trials.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe six included studies of AI treatment beyond 5 years of therapy demonstrated that extension of AI treatment was not associated with an overall survival advantage but was significantly associated with lower risks of breast cancer recurrence and contralateral breast cancer compared with placebo. Bone-related toxic effects were more common with extended AI treatment.\n\n\nRECOMMENDATIONS\nThe Panel recommends that women with node-positive breast cancer receive extended therapy, including an AI, for up to a total of 10 years of adjuvant endocrine treatment. Many women with node-negative breast cancer should consider extended therapy for up to a total of 10 years of adjuvant endocrine treatment based on considerations of recurrence risk using established prognostic factors. The Panel noted that the benefits in absolute risk of reduction were modest and that, for lower-risk node-negative or limited node-positive cancers, an individualized approach to treatment duration that is based on considerations of risk reduction and tolerability was appropriate. A substantial portion of the benefit for extended adjuvant AI therapy was derived from prevention of second breast cancers. Shared decision making between clinicians and patients is appropriate for decisions about extended adjuvant endocrine treatment, including discussions about the absolute benefits in the reduction of breast cancer recurrence, the prevention of second breast cancers, and the impact of adverse effects of treatment.

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) can transform health care practices with its increasing ability to translate the uncertainty and complexity in data into actionable—though imperfect—clinical decisions or suggestions. In the evolving relationship between humans and AI, trust is the one mechanism that shapes clinicians’ use and adoption of AI. Trust is a psychological mechanism to deal with the uncertainty between what is known and unknown. Several research studies have highlighted the need for improving AI-based systems and enhancing their capabilities to help clinicians. However, assessing the magnitude and impact of human trust on AI technology demands substantial attention. Will a clinician trust an AI-based system? What are the factors that influence human trust in AI? Can trust in AI be optimized to improve decision-making processes? In this paper, we focus on clinicians as the primary users of AI systems in health care and present factors shaping trust between clinicians and AI. We highlight critical challenges related to trust that should be considered during the development of any AI system for clinical use.",

    "abstract": "I survey four viewpoints about what AI is. I describe a program exhibiting AI as one that can change as a result of interactions with the user. Such a program would have to process hundreds or thousands of examples as opposed to a handful. Because AI is a machine's attempt to explain the behavior of the (human) system it is trying to model, the ability of a program design to scale up is critical. Researchers need to face the complexities of scaling up to programs that actually serve a purpose. The move from toy domains into concrete ones has three big consequences for the development of AI. First, it will force software designers to face the idiosyncrasies of its users. Second, it will act as an important reality check between the language of the machine, the software, and the user. Third, the scaled-up programs will become templates for future work.",

    "title": "Detection of Breast Cancer with Mammography: Effect of an Artificial Intelligence Support System.",
    "abstract": "Purpose To compare breast cancer detection performance of radiologists reading mammographic examinations unaided versus supported by an artificial intelligence (AI) system. Materials and Methods An enriched retrospective, fully crossed, multireader, multicase, HIPAA-compliant study was performed. Screening digital mammographic examinations from 240 women (median age, 62 years; range, 39-89 years) performed between 2013 and 2017 were included. The 240 examinations (100 showing cancers, 40 leading to false-positive recalls, 100 normal) were interpreted by 14 Mammography Quality Standards Act-qualified radiologists, once with and once without AI support. The readers provided a Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System score and probability of malignancy. AI support provided radiologists with interactive decision support (clicking on a breast region yields a local cancer likelihood score), traditional lesion markers for computer-detected abnormalities, and an examination-based cancer likelihood score. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), specificity and sensitivity, and reading time were compared between conditions by using mixed-models analysis dof variance and generalized linear models for multiple repeated measurements. Results On average, the AUC was higher with AI support than with unaided reading (0.89 vs 0.87, respectively; P = .002). Sensitivity increased with AI support (86% [86 of 100] vs 83% [83 of 100]; P = .046), whereas specificity trended toward improvement (79% [111 of 140]) vs 77% [108 of 140]; P = .06). Reading time per case was similar (unaided, 146 seconds; supported by AI, 149 seconds; P = .15). The AUC with the AI system alone was similar to the average AUC of the radiologists (0.89 vs 0.87). Conclusion Radiologists improved their cancer detection at mammography when using an artificial intelligence system for support, without requiring additional reading time.

    "title": "Introduction to artificial intelligence in medicine",
    "abstract": "Abstract The term Artificial Intelligence (AI) was coined by John McCarthy in 1956 during a conference held on this subject. However, the possibility of machines being able to simulate human behavior and actually think was raised earlier by Alan Turing who developed the Turing test in order to differentiate humans from machines. Since then, computational power has grown to the point of instant calculations and the ability evaluate new data, according to previously assessed data, in real time. Today, AI is integrated into our daily lives in many forms, such as personal assistants (Siri, Alexa, Google assistant etc.), automated mass transportation, aviation and computer gaming. More recently, AI has also begun to be incorporated into medicine to improve patient care by speeding up processes and achieving greater accuracy, opening the path to providing better healthcare overall. Radiological images, pathology slides, and patients’ electronic medical records (EMR) are being evaluated by machine learning, aiding in the process of diagnosis and treatment of patients and augmenting physicians’ capabilities. Herein we describe the current status of AI in medicine, the way it is used in the different disciplines and future trends.",

    "title": "Plan Explanations as Model Reconciliation: Moving Beyond Explanation as Soliloquy",
    "abstract": "When AI systems interact with humans in the loop, they are often called on to provide explanations for their plans and behavior. Past work on plan explanations primarily involved the AI system explaining the correctness of its plan and the rationale for its decision in terms of its own model. Such soliloquy is wholly inadequate in most realistic scenarios where the humans have domain and task models that differ significantly from that used by the AI system. We posit that the explanations are best studied in light of these differing models. In particular, we show how explanation can be seen as a \"model reconciliation problem\" (MRP), where the AI system in effect suggests changes to the human's model, so as to make its plan be optimal with respect to that changed human model. We will study the properties of such explanations, present algorithms for automatically computing them, and evaluate the performance of the algorithms.",

    "abstract": "Not widely known by the AI community, elevator control has become a major field of application for AI technologies. Techniques such as neural networks, genetic algorithms, fuzzy rules and, recently, multiagent systems and AI planning have been adopted by leading elevator companies not only to improve the transportation capacity of conventional elevator systems but also to revolutionize the way in which elevators interact with and serve passengers. In this article, we begin with an overview of AI techniques adopted by this industry and explain the motivations behind the continuous interest in AI. We review and summarize publications that are not easily accessible from the common AI sources. In the second part, we present in more detail a recent development project to apply AI planning and multiagent systems to elevator control problems.",

    "abstract": "Structure-based drug design is becoming an essential tool for faster and more cost-efficient lead discovery relative to the traditional method. Genomic, proteomic, and structural studies have provided hundreds of new targets and opportunities for future drug discovery. This situation poses a major problem: the necessity to handle the “big data” generated by combinatorial chemistry. Artificial intelligence (AI) and deep learning play a pivotal role in the analysis and systemization of larger data sets by statistical machine learning methods. Advanced AI-based sophisticated machine learning tools have a significant impact on the drug discovery process including medicinal chemistry. In this review, we focus on the currently available methods and algorithms for structure-based drug design including virtual screening and de novo drug design, with a special emphasis on AI- and deep-learning-based methods used for drug discovery.",

    "title": "Artificial Intelligence in Health Care: Bibliometric Analysis",
    "abstract": "Background As a critical driving power to promote health care, the health care–related artificial intelligence (AI) literature is growing rapidly. Objective The purpose of this analysis is to provide a dynamic and longitudinal bibliometric analysis of health care–related AI publications. Methods The Web of Science (Clarivate PLC) was searched to retrieve all existing and highly cited AI-related health care research papers published in English up to December 2019. Based on bibliometric indicators, a search strategy was developed to screen the title for eligibility, using the abstract and full text where needed. The growth rate of publications, characteristics of research activities, publication patterns, and research hotspot tendencies were computed using the HistCite software. Results The search identified 5235 hits, of which 1473 publications were included in the analyses. Publication output increased an average of 17.02% per year since 1995, but the growth rate of research papers significantly increased to 45.15% from 2014 to 2019. The major health problems studied in AI research are cancer, depression, Alzheimer disease, heart failure, and diabetes. Artificial neural networks, support vector machines, and convolutional neural networks have the highest impact on health care. Nucleosides, convolutional neural networks, and tumor markers have remained research hotspots through 2019. Conclusions This analysis provides a comprehensive overview of the AI-related research conducted in the field of health care, which helps researchers, policy makers, and practitioners better understand the development of health care–related AI research and possible practice implications. Future AI research should be dedicated to filling in the gaps between AI health care research and clinical applications.",

    "abstract": "This study developed and validated an instrument to measure students’ readiness to learn about artificial intelligence (AI). The designed survey questionnaire was administrated in a school district in Beijing after an AI course was developed and implemented. The collected data and analytical results provided insights regarding the self-reported perceptions of primary students’ AI readiness and enabled the identification of factors that may influence this parameter. The results indicated that AI literacy was not predictive of AI readiness. The influences of AI literacy were mediated by the students’ confidence and perception of AI relevance. The students’ AI readiness was not influenced by a reduction in their anxiety regarding AI and an enhancement in their AI literacy. Male students reported a higher confidence, relevance, and readiness for AI than female students did. The sentiments reflected by the open-ended responses of the students indicated that the students were generally excited to learn about AI and viewed AI as a powerful and useful technology. The student sentiments confirmed the quantitative findings. The validated survey can help teachers better understand and monitor students’ learning, as well as reflect on the design of the AI curriculum and the associated teaching effectiveness.",

    "abstract": "The teaching of artificial intelligence (AI) topics in school curricula is an important global strategic initiative in educating the next generation. As AI technologies are new to K-12 schools, there is a lack of studies that inform schools’ teachers about AI curriculum design. How to prepare and engage teachers, and which approaches are suitable for planning the curriculum for sustainable development, are unclear. Therefore, this case study aimed to explore the views of teachers with and without AI teaching experience on key considerations for the preparation, implementation and continuous refinement of a formal AI curriculum for K-12 schools. It drew on the self-determination theory (SDT) and four basic curriculum planning approaches—content, product, process and praxis—as theoretical frameworks to explain the research problems and findings. We conducted semi-structured interviews with 24 teachers—twelve with and twelve without experience in teaching AI—and used thematic analysis to analyze the interview data. Our findings revealed that genuine curriculum creation should encompass all four forms of curriculum design approach that are coordinated by teachers’ self-determination to be orchestrators of student learning experiences. This study also proposed a curriculum development cycle for teachers and curriculum officers.",

    "abstract": "How does organizational decision-making change with the advent of artificial intelligence (AI)-based decision-making algorithms? This article identifies the idiosyncrasies of human and AI-based decision making along five key contingency factors: specificity of the decision search space, interpretability of the decision-making process and outcome, size of the alternative set, decision-making speed, and replicability. Based on a comparison of human and AI-based decision making along these dimensions, the article builds a novel framework outlining how both modes of decision making may be combined to optimally benefit the quality of organizational decision making. The framework presents three structural categories in which decisions of organizational members can be combined with AI-based decisions: full human to AI delegation; hybrid—human-to-AI and AI-to-human—sequential decision making; and aggregated human–AI decision making.",

    "title": "Machine learning & artificial intelligence in the quantum domain: a review of recent progress",
    "abstract": "Quantum information technologies, on the one hand, and intelligent learning systems, on the other, are both emergent technologies that are likely to have a transformative impact on our society in the future. The respective underlying fields of basic research—quantum information versus machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI)—have their own specific questions and challenges, which have hitherto been investigated largely independently. However, in a growing body of recent work, researchers have been probing the question of the extent to which these fields can indeed learn and benefit from each other. Quantum ML explores the interaction between quantum computing and ML, investigating how results and techniques from one field can be used to solve the problems of the other. Recently we have witnessed significant breakthroughs in both directions of influence. For instance, quantum computing is finding a vital application in providing speed-ups for ML problems, critical in our ‘big data’ world. Conversely, ML already permeates many cutting-edge technologies and may become instrumental in advanced quantum technologies. Aside from quantum speed-up in data analysis, or classical ML optimization used in quantum experiments, quantum enhancements have also been (theoretically) demonstrated for interactive learning tasks, highlighting the potential of quantum-enhanced learning agents. Finally, works exploring the use of AI for the very design of quantum experiments and for performing parts of genuine research autonomously, have reported their first successes. Beyond the topics of mutual enhancement—exploring what ML/AI can do for quantum physics and vice versa—researchers have also broached the fundamental issue of quantum generalizations of learning and AI concepts. This deals with questions of the very meaning of learning and intelligence in a world that is fully described by quantum mechanics. In this review, we describe the main ideas, recent developments and progress in a broad spectrum of research investigating ML and AI in the quantum domain.",

    "title": "Artificial Intelligence in Advanced Manufacturing: Current Status and Future Outlook",
    "abstract": "\n Today’s manufacturing systems are becoming increasingly complex, dynamic, and connected. The factory operations face challenges of highly nonlinear and stochastic activity due to the countless uncertainties and interdependencies that exist. Recent developments in artificial intelligence (AI), especially Machine Learning (ML) have shown great potential to transform the manufacturing domain through advanced analytics tools for processing the vast amounts of manufacturing data generated, known as Big Data. The focus of this paper is threefold: (1) review the state-of-the-art applications of AI to representative manufacturing problems, (2) provide a systematic view for analyzing data and process dependencies at multiple levels that AI must comprehend, and (3) identify challenges and opportunities to not only further leverage AI for manufacturing, but also influence the future development of AI to better meet the needs of manufacturing. To satisfy these objectives, the paper adopts the hierarchical organization widely practiced in manufacturing plants in examining the interdependencies from the overall system level to the more detailed granular level of incoming material process streams. In doing so, the paper considers a wide range of topics from throughput and quality, supervisory control in human–robotic collaboration, process monitoring, diagnosis, and prognosis, finally to advances in materials engineering to achieve desired material property in process modeling and control.",

    "title": "Measuring user competence in using artificial intelligence: validity and reliability of artificial intelligence literacy scale",
    "abstract": "ABSTRACT As artificial intelligence (AI) became a part of daily life, it has become important to determine user competence in using AI technology. Here, we propose the concept of AI literacy and develop a quantitative scale for obtaining accurate data regarding the AI literacy of ordinary users. We first identified the primary core constructs of AI literacy, including awareness, use, evaluation, and ethics. Next, we generated 65 items to capture these four constructs; only 31 items were retained after a three-step content validation process. Then, we conducted a survey, and collected two samples of data. By reducing the number of items using the first sample and performing reliability and validity tests on the second sample, we obtained a 12-item instrument for the quantitative measurement of AI literacy. The results confirmed that the proposed four-construct model is an adequate representation of AI literacy. Further, AI literacy is significantly related to digital literacy, attitude towards robots, and users’ daily usage of AI. This study will not only aid researchers in understanding how user competence in using AI technology affects human–AI interactions but will also help designers develop AI applications that are aligned with the AI literacy levels of the target users.",

    "abstract": "These notes discuss formalizing contexts as first class objects. The basic relation is ist(c,p). It asserts that the proposition p is true in the context c. The most important formulas relate the propositions true in different contexts. Introducing contexts as formal objects will permit axiomatizations in limited contexts to be expanded to transcend the original limitations. This seems necessary to provide AI programs using logic with certain capabilities that human fact representation and human reasoning possess. Fully implementing transcendence seems to require further extensions to mathematical logic, i.e. beyond the nonmonotonic inference methods first invented in AI and now studied as a new domain of logic. Various notations are considered, but. these notes are tentative in not, proposing a single language with all the desired capabilities.",

    "title": "Your Robot Therapist Will See You Now: Ethical Implications of Embodied Artificial Intelligence in Psychiatry, Psychology, and Psychotherapy",
    "abstract": "Background Research in embodied artificial intelligence (AI) has increasing clinical relevance for therapeutic applications in mental health services. With innovations ranging from ‘virtual psychotherapists’ to social robots in dementia care and autism disorder, to robots for sexual disorders, artificially intelligent virtual and robotic agents are increasingly taking on high-level therapeutic interventions that used to be offered exclusively by highly trained, skilled health professionals. In order to enable responsible clinical implementation, ethical and social implications of the increasing use of embodied AI in mental health need to be identified and addressed. Objective This paper assesses the ethical and social implications of translating embodied AI applications into mental health care across the fields of Psychiatry, Psychology and Psychotherapy. Building on this analysis, it develops a set of preliminary recommendations on how to address ethical and social challenges in current and future applications of embodied AI. Methods Based on a thematic literature search and established principles of medical ethics, an analysis of the ethical and social aspects of currently embodied AI applications was conducted across the fields of Psychiatry, Psychology, and Psychotherapy. To enable a comprehensive evaluation, the analysis was structured around the following three steps: assessment of potential benefits; analysis of overarching ethical issues and concerns; discussion of specific ethical and social issues of the interventions. Results From an ethical perspective, important benefits of embodied AI applications in mental health include new modes of treatment, opportunities to engage hard-to-reach populations, better patient response, and freeing up time for physicians. Overarching ethical issues and concerns include: harm prevention and various questions of data ethics; a lack of guidance on development of AI applications, their clinical integration and training of health professionals; ‘gaps’ in ethical and regulatory frameworks; the potential for misuse including using the technologies to replace established services, thereby potentially exacerbating existing health inequalities. Specific challenges identified and discussed in the application of embodied AI include: matters of risk-assessment, referrals, and supervision; the need to respect and protect patient autonomy; the role of non-human therapy; transparency in the use of algorithms; and specific concerns regarding long-term effects of these applications on understandings of illness and the human condition. Conclusions We argue that embodied AI is a promising approach across the field of mental health; however, further research is needed to address the broader ethical and societal concerns of these technologies to negotiate best research and medical practices in innovative mental health care. We conclude by indicating areas of future research and developing recommendations for high-priority areas in need of concrete ethical guidance.",

    "abstract": "Objective To evaluate the design characteristics of studies that evaluated the performance of artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms for the diagnostic analysis of medical images. Materials and Methods PubMed MEDLINE and Embase databases were searched to identify original research articles published between January 1, 2018 and August 17, 2018 that investigated the performance of AI algorithms that analyze medical images to provide diagnostic decisions. Eligible articles were evaluated to determine 1) whether the study used external validation rather than internal validation, and in case of external validation, whether the data for validation were collected, 2) with diagnostic cohort design instead of diagnostic case-control design, 3) from multiple institutions, and 4) in a prospective manner. These are fundamental methodologic features recommended for clinical validation of AI performance in real-world practice. The studies that fulfilled the above criteria were identified. We classified the publishing journals into medical vs. non-medical journal groups. Then, the results were compared between medical and non-medical journals. Results Of 516 eligible published studies, only 6% (31 studies) performed external validation. None of the 31 studies adopted all three design features: diagnostic cohort design, the inclusion of multiple institutions, and prospective data collection for external validation. No significant difference was found between medical and non-medical journals. Conclusion Nearly all of the studies published in the study period that evaluated the performance of AI algorithms for diagnostic analysis of medical images were designed as proof-of-concept technical feasibility studies and did not have the design features that are recommended for robust validation of the real-world clinical performance of AI algorithms.",

    "abstract": "A new generation of sensor-rich, massively distributed, autonomous systems are being developed that have the potential for profound social, environmental, and economic change. These systems include networked building energy systems, autonomous space probes, chemical plant control systems, satellite constellations for remote ecosystem monitoring, power grids, biospherelike life-support systems, and reconfigurable traffic systems, to highlight but a few. To achieve high performance, these immobile robots (or immobots) will need to develop sophisticated regulatory and immune systems that accurately and robustly control their complex internal functions. Thus, immobots will exploit a vast nervous system of sensors to model themselves and their environment on a grand scale. They will use these models to dramatically reconfigure themselves to survive decades of autonomous operation. Achieving these large-scale modeling and configuration tasks will require a tight coupling between the higher-level coordination function provided by symbolic reasoning and the lower-level autonomic processes of adaptive estimation and control. To be economically viable, they will need to be programmable purely through high-level compositional models. Self-modeling and self-configuration, autonomic functions coordinated through symbolic reasoning, and compositional, model-based programming are the three key elements of a model-based autonomous system architecture that is taking us into the new millennium.",

    "abstract": "This paper is the introduction to the special issue entitled: ‘Governing artificial intelligence: ethical, legal and technical opportunities and challenges'. Artificial intelligence (AI) increasingly permeates every aspect of our society, from the critical, like urban infrastructure, law enforcement, banking, healthcare and humanitarian aid, to the mundane like dating. AI, including embodied AI in robotics and techniques like machine learning, can improve economic, social welfare and the exercise of human rights. Owing to the proliferation of AI in high-risk areas, the pressure is mounting to design and govern AI to be accountable, fair and transparent. How can this be achieved and through which frameworks? This is one of the central questions addressed in this special issue, in which eight authors present in-depth analyses of the ethical, legal-regulatory and technical challenges posed by developing governance regimes for AI systems. It also gives a brief overview of recent developments in AI governance, how much of the agenda for defining AI regulation, ethical frameworks and technical approaches is set, as well as providing some concrete suggestions to further the debate on AI governance. This article is part of the theme issue ‘Governing artificial intelligence: ethical, legal, and technical opportunities and challenges’.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence technology (or AI) has developed rapidly during the past decade, and the effects of the AI revolution are already being keenly felt in many sectors of the economy. A growing chorus of commentators, scientists, and entrepreneurs has expressed alarm regarding the increasing role that autonomous machines are playing in society, with some suggesting that government regulation may be necessary to reduce the public risks that AI will pose. Unfortunately, the unique features of AI and the manner in which AI can be developed present both practical and conceptual challenges for the legal system. These challenges must be confronted if the legal system is to positively impact the development of AI and ensure that aggrieved parties receive compensation when AI systems cause harm. This article will explore the public risks associated with AI and the competencies of government institutions in managing those risks. It concludes with a proposal for an indirect form of AI regulation based on differential tort liability.",

    "title": "Using Artificial Intelligence to Improve Real-Time Decision-Making for High-Impact Weather",
    "abstract": "AbstractHigh-impact weather events, such as severe thunderstorms, tornadoes, and hurricanes, cause significant disruptions to infrastructure, property loss, and even fatalities. High-impact events can also positively impact society, such as the impact on savings through renewable energy. Prediction of these events has improved substantially with greater observational capabilities, increased computing power, and better model physics, but there is still significant room for improvement. Artificial intelligence (AI) and data science technologies, specifically machine learning and data mining, bridge the gap between numerical model prediction and real-time guidance by improving accuracy. AI techniques also extract otherwise unavailable information from forecast models by fusing model output with observations to provide additional decision support for forecasters and users. In this work, we demonstrate that applying AI techniques along with a physical understanding of the environment can significantly improve ...",

    "abstract": "PurposeMany supply chains have faced disruption during Covid-19. Artificial intelligence (AI) is one mechanism that can be used to improve supply chain resilience by developing business continuity capabilities. This study examines how firms employ AI and consider the opportunities for AI to enhance supply chain resilience by developing visibility, risk, sourcing and distribution capabilities.Design/methodology/approachThe authors have gathered rich data by conducting semistructured interviews with 35 experts from the e-commerce supply chain. The authors have adopted a systematic approach of coding using open, axial and selective methods to map and identify the themes that represent the critical elements of AI-enabled supply chain resilience.FindingsThe results of the study highlight the emergence of five critical areas where AI can contribute to enhanced supply chain resilience; (1) transparency, (2) ensuring last-mile delivery, (3) offering personalized solutions to both upstream and downstream supply chain stakeholders, (4) minimizing the impact of disruption and (5) facilitating an agile procurement strategy.Research limitations/implicationsThe study offers interesting implications for bridging the theory–practice gap by drawing on contemporary empirical data to demonstrate how enhancing dynamic capabilities via AI technologies further strengthens supply chain resilience. The study also offers suggestions for utilizing the findings and proposes a framework to strengthen supply chain resilience through AI.Originality/valueThe study presents the dynamic capabilities for supply chain resilience through the employment of AI. AI can contribute to readying supply chains to reduce their risk of disruption through enhanced resilience.",

    "abstract": "People supported by AI-powered decision support tools frequently overrely on the AI: they accept an AI's suggestion even when that suggestion is wrong. Adding explanations to the AI decisions does not appear to reduce the overreliance and some studies suggest that it might even increase it. Informed by the dual-process theory of cognition, we posit that people rarely engage analytically with each individual AI recommendation and explanation, and instead develop general heuristics about whether and when to follow the AI suggestions. Building on prior research on medical decision-making, we designed three cognitive forcing interventions to compel people to engage more thoughtfully with the AI-generated explanations. We conducted an experiment (N=199), in which we compared our three cognitive forcing designs to two simple explainable AI approaches and to a no-AI baseline. The results demonstrate that cognitive forcing significantly reduced overreliance compared to the simple explainable AI approaches. However, there was a trade-off: people assigned the least favorable subjective ratings to the designs that reduced the overreliance the most. To audit our work for intervention-generated inequalities, we investigated whether our interventions benefited equally people with different levels of Need for Cognition (i.e., motivation to engage in effortful mental activities). Our results show that, on average, cognitive forcing interventions benefited participants higher in Need for Cognition more. Our research suggests that human cognitive motivation moderates the effectiveness of explainable AI solutions.",

    "abstract": "Abstract With the development and evolution of information technology, competition has become more and more intensive on a global scale. Many companies have forecast that the future of operation and supply chain management (SCM) may change dramatically, from planning, scheduling, optimisation, to transportation, with the presence of artificial intelligence (AI). People will be more and more interested in machine learning, AI, and other intelligent technologies, in terms of SCM. Within this context, this particular research study provides an overview of the concept of AI and SCM. It then focuses on timely and critical analysis of AI-driven supply chain research and applications. In this exploratory research, the emerging AI-based business models of different case companies are analysed. Their relevant AI solutions and related values to companies are also evaluated. As a result, this research identifies several areas of value creation for the application of AI in the supply chain. It also proposes an approach to designing business models for AI supply chain applications.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Artificial intelligence (AI) has been presented as a powerful tool in human resource management (HRM), but little academic research exists on the topic. The present study introduces the technology, organization, and environment (TOE) model from information systems research and integrates it with the transaction cost theory to better understand the facilitators and the constraints of companies’ AI adoption behavior during employee recruitment. Survey results from 297 Chinese companies suggest that companies’ perceived complexity toward AI constrains AI adoption, while technology competence and regulatory support encourage AI adoption. Relative advantages of AI technology, company size, and industry have no significant impact on AI usage. The findings also demonstrate the moderating effects of transaction costs on the influential power of technological complexity and organizations’ technology competence.",

    "abstract": "Summary In recent years, there has been massive progress in artificial intelligence (AI) with the development of deep neural networks, natural language processing, computer vision and robotics. These techniques are now actively being applied in healthcare with many of the health service activities currently being delivered by clinicians and administrators predicted to be taken over by AI in the coming years. However, there has also been exceptional hype about the abilities of AI with a mistaken notion that AI will replace human clinicians altogether. These perspectives are inaccurate, and if a balanced perspective of the limitations and promise of AI is taken, one can gauge which parts of the health system AI can be integrated to make a meaningful impact. The four main areas where AI would have the most influence would be: patient administration, clinical decision support, patient monitoring and healthcare interventions. This health system where AI plays a central role could be termed an AI-enabled or AI-augmented health system. In this article, we discuss how this system can be developed based on a realistic assessment of current AI technologies and predicted developments.",

    "title": "Emerging role of deep learning‐based artificial intelligence in tumor pathology",
    "abstract": "The development of digital pathology and progression of state‐of‐the‐art algorithms for computer vision have led to increasing interest in the use of artificial intelligence (AI), especially deep learning (DL)‐based AI, in tumor pathology. The DL‐based algorithms have been developed to conduct all kinds of work involved in tumor pathology, including tumor diagnosis, subtyping, grading, staging, and prognostic prediction, as well as the identification of pathological features, biomarkers and genetic changes. The applications of AI in pathology not only contribute to improve diagnostic accuracy and objectivity but also reduce the workload of pathologists and subsequently enable them to spend additional time on high‐level decision‐making tasks. In addition, AI is useful for pathologists to meet the requirements of precision oncology. However, there are still some challenges relating to the implementation of AI, including the issues of algorithm validation and interpretability, computing systems, the unbelieving attitude of pathologists, clinicians and patients, as well as regulators and reimbursements. Herein, we present an overview on how AI‐based approaches could be integrated into the workflow of pathologists and discuss the challenges and perspectives of the implementation of AI in tumor pathology.",

    "title": "Human- versus Artificial Intelligence",
    "abstract": "AI is one of the most debated subjects of today and there seems little common understanding concerning the differences and similarities of human intelligence and artificial intelligence. Discussions on many relevant topics, such as trustworthiness, explainability, and ethics are characterized by implicit anthropocentric and anthropomorphistic conceptions and, for instance, the pursuit of human-like intelligence as the golden standard for Artificial Intelligence. In order to provide more agreement and to substantiate possible future research objectives, this paper presents three notions on the similarities and differences between human- and artificial intelligence: 1) the fundamental constraints of human (and artificial) intelligence, 2) human intelligence as one of many possible forms of general intelligence, and 3) the high potential impact of multiple (integrated) forms of narrow-hybrid AI applications. For the time being, AI systems will have fundamentally different cognitive qualities and abilities than biological systems. For this reason, a most prominent issue is how we can use (and “collaborate” with) these systems as effectively as possible? For what tasks and under what conditions, decisions are safe to leave to AI and when is human judgment required? How can we capitalize on the specific strengths of human- and artificial intelligence? How to deploy AI systems effectively to complement and compensate for the inherent constraints of human cognition (and vice versa)? Should we pursue the development of AI “partners” with human (-level) intelligence or should we focus more at supplementing human limitations? In order to answer these questions, humans working with AI systems in the workplace or in policy making have to develop an adequate mental model of the underlying ‘psychological’ mechanisms of AI. So, in order to obtain well-functioning human-AI systems, Intelligence Awareness in humans should be addressed more vigorously. For this purpose a first framework for educational content is proposed.",

    "title": "Multiple knowledge representation for big data artificial intelligence: framework, applications, and case studies",
    "abstract": "In this paper, we present a multiple knowledge representation (MKR) framework and discuss its potential for developing big data artificial intelligence (AI) techniques with possible broader impacts across different AI areas. Typically, canonical knowledge representations and modern representations each emphasize a particular aspect of transforming inputs into symbolic encoding or vectors. For example, knowledge graphs focus on depicting semantic connections among concepts, whereas deep neural networks (DNNs) are more of a tool to perceive raw signal inputs. MKR is an advanced AI representation framework for more complete intelligent functions, such as raw signal perception, feature extraction and vectorization, knowledge symbolization, and logical reasoning. MKR has two benefits: (1) it makes the current AI techniques (dominated by deep learning) more explainable and generalizable, and (2) it expands current AI techniques by integrating MKR to facilitate the mutual benefits of the complementary capacity of each representation, e.g., raw signal perception and symbolic encoding. We expect that MKR research and its applications will drive the evolution of AI 2.0 and beyond.",

    "title": "Anthropomorphism and customers’ willingness to use artificial intelligence service agents",
    "abstract": "ABSTRACT Previous studies provide inconsistent evidence regarding the effect of anthropomorphism on customers’ willingness to use AI service agents. This paper explains the reason by introducing service context. Two situational experiments are used to demonstrate that under the context of high perceived control, customers expect AI service agents with more anthropomorphic designs to perform better and prefer highly human-like AI service agents. However, under the context of low perceived control, customers perceive stronger threat in facing AI service agents with more anthropomorphic designs and prefer less human-like AI service agents. Moreover, we find that this effect is significant only in social scenarios. These findings provide new insights into previous inconsistent evidence regarding anthropomorphic design’s influence on customers’ willingness to use AI service agents. Our findings also have important implications for AI service agents design in different service contexts and advance the literature on human–robot interaction and marketing.",

    "title": "Artificial intelligence: Implications for the future of work.",
    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) is a broad transdisciplinary field with roots in logic, statistics, cognitive psychology, decision theory, neuroscience, linguistics, cybernetics, and computer engineering. The modern field of AI began at a small summer workshop at Dartmouth College in 1956. Since then, AI applications made possible by machine learning (ML), an AI subdiscipline, include Internet searches, e-commerce sites, goods and services recommender systems, image and speech recognition, sensor technologies, robotic devices, and cognitive decision support systems (DSSs). As more applications are integrated into everyday life, AI is predicted to have a globally transformative influence on economic and social structures similar to the effect that other general-purpose technologies, such as steam engines, railroads, electricity, electronics, and the Internet, have had. Novel AI applications in the workplace of the future raise important issues for occupational safety and health. This commentary reviews the origins of AI, use of ML methods, and emerging AI applications embedded in physical objects like sensor technologies, robotic devices, or operationalized in intelligent DSSs. Selected implications on the future of work arising from the use of AI applications, including job displacement from automation and management of human-machine interactions, are also reviewed. Engaging in strategic foresight about AI workplace applications will shift occupational research and practice from a reactive posture to a proactive one. Understanding the possibilities and challenges of AI for the future of work will help mitigate the unfavorable effects of AI on worker safety, health, and well-being.",

They have raised fundamental questions about what we should do with these systems, what the systems themselves should do, what risks they involve, and how we can control these. - After the Introduction to the field (§1), the main themes (§2) of this article are: Ethical issues that arise with AI systems as objects, i.e., tools made and used by humans. This includes issues of privacy (§2.1) and manipulation (§2.2), opacity (§2.3) and bias (§2.4), human-robot interaction (§2.5), employment (§2.6), and the effects of autonomy (§2.7). Then AI systems as subjects, i.e., ethics for the AI systems themselves in machine ethics (§2.8) and artificial moral agency (§2.9). Finally, the problem of a possible future AI superintelligence leading to a “singularity” (§2.10). We close with a remark on the vision of AI (§3). - For each section within these themes, we provide a general explanation of the ethical issues, outline existing positions and arguments, then analyse how these play out with current technologies and finally, what policy consequences may be drawn.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT The rapid developments in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and the intensification in the adoption of AI in domains such as autonomous vehicles, lethal weapon systems, robotics and alike pose serious challenges to governments as they must manage the scale and speed of socio-technical transitions occurring. While there is considerable literature emerging on various aspects of AI, governance of AI is a significantly underdeveloped area. The new applications of AI offer opportunities for increasing economic efficiency and quality of life, but they also generate unexpected and unintended consequences and pose new forms of risks that need to be addressed. To enhance the benefits from AI while minimising the adverse risks, governments worldwide need to understand better the scope and depth of the risks posed and develop regulatory and governance processes and structures to address these challenges. This introductory article unpacks AI and describes why the Governance of AI should be gaining far more attention given the myriad of challenges it presents. It then summarises the special issue articles and highlights their key contributions. This special issue introduces the multifaceted challenges of governance of AI, including emerging governance approaches to AI, policy capacity building, exploring legal and regulatory challenges of AI and Robotics, and outstanding issues and gaps that need attention. The special issue showcases the state-of-the-art in the governance of AI, aiming to enable researchers and practitioners to appreciate the challenges and complexities of AI governance and highlight future avenues for exploration.",

    "abstract": "The smart grid is enabling the collection of massive amounts of high-dimensional and multi-type data about the electric power grid operations, by integrating advanced metering infrastructure, control technologies, and communication technologies. However, the traditional modeling, optimization, and control technologies have many limitations in processing the data; thus, the applications of artificial intelligence (AI) techniques in the smart grid are becoming more apparent. This survey presents a structured review of the existing research into some common AI techniques applied to load forecasting, power grid stability assessment, faults detection, and security problems in the smart grid and power systems. It also provides further research challenges for applying AI technologies to realize truly smart grid systems. Finally, this survey presents opportunities of applying AI to smart grid problems. The paper concludes that the applications of AI techniques can enhance and improve the reliability and resilience of smart grid systems.",

    "abstract": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) is being implemented in more and more fields, including education. The main uses of AI in education are related to tutoring and assessment. This paper analyzes the use of AI for student assessment based on a systematic review. For this purpose, a search was carried out in two databases: Scopus and Web of Science. A total of 454 papers were found and, after analyzing them according to the PRISMA Statement, a total of 22 papers were selected. It is clear from the studies analyzed that, in most of them, the pedagogy underlying the educational action is not reflected. Similarly, formative evaluation seems to be the main use of AI. Another of the main functionalities of AI in assessment is for the automatic grading of students. Several studies analyze the differences between the use of AI and its non-use. We discuss the results and conclude the need for teacher training and further research to understand the possibilities of AI in educational assessment, mainly in other educational levels than higher education. Moreover, it is necessary to increase the wealth of research which focuses on educational aspects more than technical development around AI.",

    "title": "The Janus face of artificial intelligence feedback: Deployment versus disclosure effects on employee performance",
    "abstract": "Companies are increasingly using artificial intelligence (AI) to provide performance feedback to employees, by tracking employee behavior at work, automating performance evaluations, and recommending job improvements. However, this application of AI has provoked much debate. On the one hand, powerful AI data analytics increase the quality of feedback, which may enhance employee productivity (“deployment effect”). On the other hand, employees may develop a negative perception of AI feedback once it is disclosed to them, thus harming their productivity (“disclosure effect”). We examine these two effects theoretically and test them empirically using data from a field experiment. We find strong evidence that both effects coexist, and that the adverse disclosure effect is mitigated by employees' tenure in the firm. These findings offer pivotal implications for management theory, practice, and public policies. Managerial abstract Artificial intelligence (AI) technologies are bound to transform how companies manage employees. We examine the use of AI to generate performance feedback for employees. We demonstrate that AI significantly increases the accuracy and consistency of the analyses of information collected, and the relevance of feedback to each employee. These advantages of AI help employees achieve greater job performance at scale, and thus create value for companies. However, our study also alerts companies to the negative effect of disclosing using AI to employee that results from employees' negative perceptions about the deployment of AI, which offsets the business value created by AI. To alleviate value‐destroying disclosure effect, we suggest that companies be more proactive in communicating with their employees about the objectives, benefits, and scope of AI applications in order to assuage their concerns. Moreover, the result of the allayed negative AI disclosure effect among employees with a longer tenure in the company suggests that companies may consider deploying AI in a tiered instead of a uniform fashion, that is, using AI to provide performance feedback to veteran employees but using human managers to provide performance feedback to novices.",

    "abstract": "Learning mathematics has been considered as a great challenge for many students. The advancement of computer technologies, in particular, artificial intelligence (AI), provides an opportunity to cope with this problem by diagnosing individual students’ learning problems and providing personalized supports to maximize their learning performances in mathematics courses. However, there is a lack of reviews from diverse perspectives to help researchers, especially novices, gain a whole picture of the research of AI in mathematics education. To this end, this research aims to conduct a bibliometric mapping analysis and systematic review to explore the role and research trends of AI in mathematics education by searching for the relevant articles published in the quality journals indexed by the Social Sciences Citation Index (SSCI) from the Web of Science (WOS) database. Moreover, by referring to the technology-based learning model, several dimensions of AI in mathematics education research, such as the application domains, participants, research methods, adopted technologies, research issues and the roles of AI as well as the citation and co-citation relationships, are taken into account. Accordingly, the advancements of AI in mathematics education research are reported, and potential research topics for future research are recommended.",

Guided by insights from values in design and the sociology of business ethics, we uncover the grounding assumptions and terms of debate that make some conversations about ethical design possible while forestalling alternative visions. Vision statements for ethical AI/ML co-opt the language of some critics, folding them into a limited, technologically deterministic, expert-driven view of what ethical AI/ML means and how it might work.",

    "title": "Deep Learning for Automated Contouring of Primary Tumor Volumes by MRI for Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma.",
    "abstract": "Background Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) may be cured with radiation therapy. Tumor proximity to critical structures demands accuracy in tumor delineation to avoid toxicities from radiation therapy; however, tumor target contouring for head and neck radiation therapy is labor intensive and highly variable among radiation oncologists. Purpose To construct and validate an artificial intelligence (AI) contouring tool to automate primary gross tumor volume (GTV) contouring in patients with NPC. Materials and Methods In this retrospective study, MRI data sets covering the nasopharynx from 1021 patients (median age, 47 years; 751 male, 270 female) with NPC between September 2016 and September 2017 were collected and divided into training, validation, and testing cohorts of 715, 103, and 203 patients, respectively. GTV contours were delineated for 1021 patients and were defined by consensus of two experts. A three-dimensional convolutional neural network was applied to 818 training and validation MRI data sets to construct the AI tool, which was tested in 203 independent MRI data sets. Next, the AI tool was compared against eight qualified radiation oncologists in a multicenter evaluation by using a random sample of 20 test MRI examinations. The Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed rank test was used to compare the difference of Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) of pre- versus post-AI assistance. Results The AI-generated contours demonstrated a high level of accuracy when compared with ground truth contours at testing in 203 patients (DSC, 0.79; 2.0-mm difference in average surface distance). In multicenter evaluation, AI assistance improved contouring accuracy (five of eight oncologists had a higher median DSC after AI assistance; average median DSC, 0.74 vs 0.78; P < .001), reduced intra- and interobserver variation (by 36.4% and 54.5%, respectively), and reduced contouring time (by 39.4%). Conclusion The AI contouring tool improved primary gross tumor contouring accuracy of nasopharyngeal carcinoma, which could have a positive impact on tumor control and patient survival. © RSNA, 2019 Online supplemental material is available for this article.

    "abstract": "In the past decade, current literature and businesses have drawn attention to Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools and in particular to the advances in machine learning techniques. Nevertheless, while the AI technology offers great potential to solve difficulties, challenges remain implicated in practical implementation and lack of expertise in the strategic usage of AI to create business value. This paper aims to implement a systematic literature review analyzing convergence of the AI and corporate strategy and develop a theoretical model incorporating issues based on the existing research in this field. Eighty-one peer-reviewed articles were discussed on the basis of research methodology from Webster and Watson (2002). In addition to gaps in future research, a theoretical model is developed, discussing the four sources of value creation: AI and Machine Learning in organizations; alignment of AI tools and Information Technology (IT) with organizational strategy; AI, knowledge management and decision-making process; and AI, service innovation and value. These outcomes lead to both theoretical and managerial viewpoints, with extensive possibilities to generate new methods and types of management practices.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) has contributed substantially to the resolution of a variety of biomedical problems, including cancer, over the past decade. Deep learning, a subfield of AI that is highly flexible and supports automatic feature extraction, is increasingly being applied in various areas of both basic and clinical cancer research. In this review, we describe numerous recent examples of the application of AI in oncology, including cases in which deep learning has efficiently solved problems that were previously thought to be unsolvable, and we address obstacles that must be overcome before such application can become more widespread. We also highlight resources and datasets that can help harness the power of AI for cancer research. The development of innovative approaches to and applications of AI will yield important insights in oncology in the coming decade.",

    "title": "Application of Artificial Intelligence in Dentistry",
    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) is a technology that utilizes machines to mimic intelligent human behavior. To appreciate human-technology interaction in the clinical setting, augmented intelligence has been proposed as a cognitive extension of AI in health care, emphasizing its assistive and supplementary role to medical professionals. While truly autonomous medical robotic systems are still beyond reach, the virtual component of AI, known as software-type algorithms, is the main component used in dentistry. Because of their powerful capabilities in data analysis, these virtual algorithms are expected to improve the accuracy and efficacy of dental diagnosis, provide visualized anatomic guidance for treatment, simulate and evaluate prospective results, and project the occurrence and prognosis of oral diseases. Potential obstacles in contemporary algorithms that prevent routine implementation of AI include the lack of data curation, sharing, and readability; the inability to illustrate the inner decision-making process; the insufficient power of classical computing; and the neglect of ethical principles in the design of AI frameworks. It is necessary to maintain a proactive attitude toward AI to ensure its affirmative development and promote human-technology rapport to revolutionize dental practice. The present review outlines the progress and potential dental applications of AI in medical-aided diagnosis, treatment, and disease prediction and discusses their data limitations, interpretability, computing power, and ethical considerations, as well as their impact on dentists, with the objective of creating a backdrop for future research in this rapidly expanding arena.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT Introduction Increasing demand for mental health services and the expanding capabilities of artificial intelligence (AI) in recent years has driven the development of digital mental health interventions (DMHIs). To date, AI-based chatbots have been integrated into DMHIs to support diagnostics and screening, symptom management and behavior change, and content delivery. Areas covered We summarize the current landscape of DMHIs, with a focus on AI-based chatbots. Happify Health’s AI chatbot, Anna, serves as a case study for discussion of potential challenges and how these might be addressed, and demonstrates the promise of chatbots as effective, usable, and adoptable within DMHIs. Finally, we discuss ways in which future research can advance the field, addressing topics including perceptions of AI, the impact of individual differences, and implications for privacy and ethics. Expert opinion Our discussion concludes with a speculative viewpoint on the future of AI in DMHIs, including the use of chatbots, the evolution of AI, dynamic mental health systems, hyper-personalization, and human-like intervention delivery.",

    "abstract": "As AI is increasingly being adopted into application solutions, the challenge of supporting interaction with humans is becoming more apparent. Partly this is to support integrated working styles, in which humans and intelligent systems cooperate in problem-solving, but also it is a necessary step in the process of building trust as humans migrate greater responsibility to such systems. The challenge is to find effective ways to communicate the foundations of AI-driven behaviour, when the algorithms that drive it are far from transparent to humans. In this paper we consider the opportunities that arise in AI planning, exploiting the modelbased representations that form a familiar and common basis for communication with users, while acknowledging the gap between planning algorithms and human problem-solving.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT The study discusses artificial intelligence (AI) – powered applications as a commercial service with a focus on the hotel industry. This research is approached from the customers’ perspective and examines how AI and employee service quality influence customer satisfaction and loyalty. The study was conducted in multiple hotels in Portugal and focused on departure guests who had experienced both AI and employee services associated with the surveyed hotels. The results show that both AI and employee service quality explain significant variances in overall service quality assessment as well as customer satisfaction and loyalty. However, only certain service quality dimensions made unique variances in the outcomes of interest. When regressing both AI and employee service quality in the same equation, AI becomes negative and insignificant. This study contributes to the AI and customer loyalty research. The findings of this study have financial implications for hotels and provide insights into optimal resource allocation.",

    "abstract": "Aims\nForce-Time Integral (FTI) is commonly used as a marker of ablation lesion quality during pulmonary vein isolation (PVI), but does not incorporate power. Ablation Index (AI) is a novel lesion quality marker that utilizes contact force, time, and power in a weighted formula. Furthermore, only a single FTI target value has been suggested despite regional variation in left atrial wall thickness. We aimed to study AI's and FTI's relationships with PV reconnection at repeat electrophysiology study, and regional threshold values that predicted no reconnection.\n\n\nMethods and results\nForty paroxysmal atrial fibrillation patients underwent contact force-guided PVI, and the minimum and mean AI and FTI values for each segment were identified according to a 12-segment model. All patients underwent repeat electrophysiology study at 2 months, regardless of symptoms, to identify sites of PV reconnection. Late PV reconnection was seen in 53 (11%) segments in 25 (62%) patients. Reconnected segments had significantly lower minimum AI [308 (252-336) vs. 373 (323-423), P < 0.0001] and FTI [137 (92-182) vs. 228 (157-334), P < 0.0001] compared with non-reconnected segments. Minimum AI and FTI were both independently predictive, but AI had a smaller P value. Higher minimum AI and FTI values were required to avoid reconnection in anterior/roof segments than for posterior/inferior segments (P < 0.0001). No reconnection was seen where the minimum AI value was ≥370 for posterior/inferior segments and ≥480 for anterior/roof segments.\n\n\nConclusion\nThe minimum AI value in a PVI segment is independently predictive of reconnection of that segment at repeat electrophysiology study. Higher AI and FTI values are required for anterior/roof segments than for posterior/inferior segments to prevent reconnection.",

    "abstract": "Objective The present meta-analysis sought to determine significant factors that predict trust in artificial intelligence (AI). Such factors were divided into those relating to (a) the human trustor, (b) the AI trustee, and (c) the shared context of their interaction. Background There are many factors influencing trust in robots, automation, and technology in general, and there have been several meta-analytic attempts to understand the antecedents of trust in these areas. However, no targeted meta-analysis has been performed examining the antecedents of trust in AI. Method Data from 65 articles examined the three predicted categories, as well as the subcategories of human characteristics and abilities, AI performance and attributes, and contextual tasking. Lastly, four common uses for AI (i.e., chatbots, robots, automated vehicles, and nonembodied, plain algorithms) were examined as further potential moderating factors. Results Results showed that all of the examined categories were significant predictors of trust in AI as well as many individual antecedents such as AI reliability and anthropomorphism, among many others. Conclusion Overall, the results of this meta-analysis determined several factors that influence trust, including some that have no bearing on AI performance. Additionally, we highlight the areas where there is currently no empirical research. Application Findings from this analysis will allow designers to build systems that elicit higher or lower levels of trust, as they require.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nAdrenal crisis (AC) is a life-threatening complication of adrenal insufficiency (AI), which according to retrospective data represents a significant clinical complication. Here we aimed to prospectively assess incidence of AC and mortality associated with AC in patients with chronic AI.\n\n\nMETHODS\nA total of 423 patients with AI (primary AI, n = 221; secondary AI, n = 202) were prospectively followed up for 2 years. Baseline assessment included a general questionnaire and detailed written instructions on glucocorticoid dose adaptation during stress. Patients received follow-up questionnaires every 6 months and were contacted by phone in case of reported adrenal crisis.\n\n\nRESULTS\nA total of 423 data sets were available for baseline analysis, and 364 patients (86%) completed the whole study. Sixy-four AC in 767.5 patient-years were documented (8.3 crises per 100 patient-years). Precipitating causes were mainly gastrointestinal infection, fever, and emotional stress (20%, respectively) but also other stressful events (eg, major pain, surgery, strenuous physical activity, heat, pregnancy) or unexplained sudden onset of AC (7%) were documented. Patients with a previous AC were at higher risk of crisis (odds ratio 2.85, 95% confidence interval 1.5-5.5, P < .01). However, no further risk factors could be identified. Ten patients died during follow-up; in four cases death was associated with AC (0.5 AC related deaths per 100 patient-years).\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nEven in educated patients with chronic adrenal insufficiency, AC occurs in a substantial proportion of cases. Furthermore, we identified AC-associated mortality in approximately 6% of AC. Our findings further emphasize the need for improved management of AC in patients with chronic AI.",

    "abstract": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a potentially powerful tool in the fight against the COVID- 19 pandemic. Since the outbreak of the pandemic, there has been a scramble to use AI. This article provides an early, and necessarily selective review, discussing the contribution of AI to the fight against COVID-19, as well as the current constraints on these contributions. Six areas where AI can contribute to the fight against COVID-19 are discussed, namely i) early warnings and alerts, ii) tracking and prediction, iii) data dashboards, iv) diagnosis and prognosis, v) treatments and cures, and vi) social control. It is concluded that AI has not yet been impactful against COVID-19. Its use is hampered by a lack of data, and by too much data. Overcoming these constraints will require a careful balance between data privacy and public health, and rigorous human-AI interaction. It is unlikely that these will be addressed in time to be of much help during the present pandemic. In the meantime, extensive gathering of diagnostic data on who is infectious will be essential to save lives, train AI, and limit economic damages.",

Human-centered artificial intelligence is a perspective on AI and ML that algorithms must be designed with awareness that they are part of a larger system consisting of humans. We lay forth an argument that human-centered artificial intelligence can be broken down into two aspects: (1) AI systems that understand humans from a sociocultural perspective, and (2) AI systems that help humans understand them.

    "title": "A Survey of Recent Advances in Edge-Computing-Powered Artificial Intelligence of Things",
    "abstract": "The Internet of Things (IoT) has created a ubiquitously connected world powered by a multitude of wired and wireless sensors generating a variety of heterogeneous data over time in a myriad of fields and applications. To extract complete information from these data, advanced artificial intelligence (AI) technology, especially deep learning (DL), has proved successful in facilitating data analytics, future prediction and decision making. The collective integration of AI and the IoT has greatly promoted the rapid development of AI-of-Things (AIoT) systems that analyze and respond to external stimuli more intelligently without involvement by humans. However, it is challenging or infeasible to process massive amounts of data in the cloud due to the destructive impact of the volume, velocity, and veracity of data and fatal transmission latency on networking infrastructures. These critical challenges can be adequately addressed by introducing edge computing. This article conducts an extensive survey of an end-edge-cloud orchestrated architecture for flexible AIoT systems. Specifically, it begins with articulating fundamental concepts including the IoT, AI and edge computing. Guided by these concepts, it explores the general AIoT architecture, presents a practical AIoT example to illustrate how AI can be applied in real-world applications and summarizes promising AIoT applications. Then, the emerging technologies for AI models regarding inference and training at the edge of the network are reviewed. Finally, the open challenges and future directions in this promising area are outlined.",

    "title": "Role of Artificial Intelligence Applications in Real-Life Clinical Practice: Systematic Review",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nArtificial intelligence (AI) applications are growing at an unprecedented pace in health care, including disease diagnosis, triage or screening, risk analysis, surgical operations, and so forth. Despite a great deal of research in the development and validation of health care AI, only few applications have been actually implemented at the frontlines of clinical practice.\n\n\nOBJECTIVE\nThe objective of this study was to systematically review AI applications that have been implemented in real-life clinical practice.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe conducted a literature search in PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Central, and CINAHL to identify relevant articles published between January 2010 and May 2020. We also hand searched premier computer science journals and conferences as well as registered clinical trials. Studies were included if they reported AI applications that had been implemented in real-world clinical settings.\n\n\nRESULTS\nWe identified 51 relevant studies that reported the implementation and evaluation of AI applications in clinical practice, of which 13 adopted a randomized controlled trial design and eight adopted an experimental design. The AI applications targeted various clinical tasks, such as screening or triage (n=16), disease diagnosis (n=16), risk analysis (n=14), and treatment (n=7). The most commonly addressed diseases and conditions were sepsis (n=6), breast cancer (n=5), diabetic retinopathy (n=4), and polyp and adenoma (n=4). Regarding the evaluation outcomes, we found that 26 studies examined the performance of AI applications in clinical settings, 33 studies examined the effect of AI applications on clinician outcomes, 14 studies examined the effect on patient outcomes, and one study examined the economic impact associated with AI implementation.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThis review indicates that research on the clinical implementation of AI applications is still at an early stage despite the great potential. More research needs to assess the benefits and challenges associated with clinical AI applications through a more rigorous methodology.",

    "title": "Towards Playing Full MOBA Games with Deep Reinforcement Learning",
    "abstract": "MOBA games, e.g., Honor of Kings, League of Legends, and Dota 2, pose grand challenges to AI systems such as multi-agent, enormous state-action space, complex action control, etc. Developing AI for playing MOBA games has raised much attention accordingly. However, existing work falls short in handling the raw game complexity caused by the explosion of agent combinations, i.e., lineups, when expanding the hero pool in case that OpenAI's Dota AI limits the play to a pool of only 17 heroes. As a result, full MOBA games without restrictions are far from being mastered by any existing AI system. In this paper, we propose a MOBA AI learning paradigm that methodologically enables playing full MOBA games with deep reinforcement learning. Specifically, we develop a combination of novel and existing learning techniques, including curriculum self-play learning, policy distillation, off-policy adaption, multi-head value estimation, and Monte-Carlo tree-search, in training and playing a large pool of heroes, meanwhile addressing the scalability issue skillfully. Tested on Honor of Kings, a popular MOBA game, we show how to build superhuman AI agents that can defeat top esports players. The superiority of our AI is demonstrated by the first large-scale performance test of MOBA AI agent in the literature.",

    "title": "The EU Approach to Ethics Guidelines for Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence",
    "abstract": "A continuous journey towards an appropriate governance framework for AI As part of its European strategy for Artificial Intelligence (AI), and as a response to the increasing ethical questions raised by this technology, the European Commission established an independent High-Level Expert Group on Artificial Intelligence (AI HLEG) in June 2018. The group was tasked to draft two deliver-ables: AI Ethics Guidelines and Policy and Investment Recommendations. Nine months later, its first deliverable was published, putting forward a comprehensive framework to achieve “ Trustworthy AI ” by offering ethical guidance to AI practitioners. This paper dives into the work carried out by the group, focusing in particular on its AI Ethics Guidelines. First, this paper clarifies the context that led to the creation of the AI HLEG and its mandate (I.). Subsequently, it elaborates on the Guidelines ’ aim and purpose (II.), and analyses the Guidelines ’ drafting process (III.). Particular focus is given to the questions surrounding the respective role played by ethics and law in the AI governance landscape (IV.), as well as some of the challenges that had to be overcome throughout the process (V.). Finally, this paper places the Guidelines in an international context, and sets out the next steps (VI.) ahead on the journey towards an appropriate governance framework for AI (VII.).",

    "title": "Role of Artificial Intelligence in Patient Safety Outcomes: Systematic Literature Review",
    "abstract": "Background Artificial intelligence (AI) provides opportunities to identify the health risks of patients and thus influence patient safety outcomes. Objective The purpose of this systematic literature review was to identify and analyze quantitative studies utilizing or integrating AI to address and report clinical-level patient safety outcomes. Methods We restricted our search to the PubMed, PubMed Central, and Web of Science databases to retrieve research articles published in English between January 2009 and August 2019. We focused on quantitative studies that reported positive, negative, or intermediate changes in patient safety outcomes using AI apps, specifically those based on machine-learning algorithms and natural language processing. Quantitative studies reporting only AI performance but not its influence on patient safety outcomes were excluded from further review. Results We identified 53 eligible studies, which were summarized concerning their patient safety subcategories, the most frequently used AI, and reported performance metrics. Recognized safety subcategories were clinical alarms (n=9; mainly based on decision tree models), clinical reports (n=21; based on support vector machine models), and drug safety (n=23; mainly based on decision tree models). Analysis of these 53 studies also identified two essential findings: (1) the lack of a standardized benchmark and (2) heterogeneity in AI reporting. Conclusions This systematic review indicates that AI-enabled decision support systems, when implemented correctly, can aid in enhancing patient safety by improving error detection, patient stratification, and drug management. Future work is still needed for robust validation of these systems in prospective and real-world clinical environments to understand how well AI can predict safety outcomes in health care settings.",

    "title": "Artificial Intelligence Techniques: Analysis, Application, and Outcome in Dentistry—A Systematic Review",
    "abstract": "Objective The objective of this systematic review was to investigate the quality and outcome of studies into artificial intelligence techniques, analysis, and effect in dentistry. Materials and Methods Using the MeSH keywords: artificial intelligence (AI), dentistry, AI in dentistry, neural networks and dentistry, machine learning, AI dental imaging, and AI treatment recommendations and dentistry. Two investigators performed an electronic search in 5 databases: PubMed/MEDLINE (National Library of Medicine), Scopus (Elsevier), ScienceDirect databases (Elsevier), Web of Science (Clarivate Analytics), and the Cochrane Collaboration (Wiley). The English language articles reporting on AI in different dental specialties were screened for eligibility. Thirty-two full-text articles were selected and systematically analyzed according to a predefined inclusion criterion. These articles were analyzed as per a specific research question, and the relevant data based on article general characteristics, study and control groups, assessment methods, outcomes, and quality assessment were extracted. Results The initial search identified 175 articles related to AI in dentistry based on the title and abstracts. The full text of 38 articles was assessed for eligibility to exclude studies not fulfilling the inclusion criteria. Six articles not related to AI in dentistry were excluded. Thirty-two articles were included in the systematic review. It was revealed that AI provides accurate patient management, dental diagnosis, prediction, and decision making. Artificial intelligence appeared as a reliable modality to enhance future implications in the various fields of dentistry, i.e., diagnostic dentistry, patient management, head and neck cancer, restorative dentistry, prosthetic dental sciences, orthodontics, radiology, and periodontics. Conclusion The included studies describe that AI is a reliable tool to make dental care smooth, better, time-saving, and economical for practitioners. AI benefits them in fulfilling patient demand and expectations. The dentists can use AI to ensure quality treatment, better oral health care outcome, and achieve precision. AI can help to predict failures in clinical scenarios and depict reliable solutions. However, AI is increasing the scope of state-of-the-art models in dentistry but is still under development. Further studies are required to assess the clinical performance of AI techniques in dentistry.",

    "abstract": "Smart cities and artificial intelligence (AI) are among the most popular discourses in urban policy circles. Most attempts at using AI to improve efficiencies in cities have nevertheless either struggled or failed to accomplish the smart city transformation. This is mainly due to short-sighted, technologically determined and reductionist AI approaches being applied to complex urbanization problems. Besides this, as smart cities are underpinned by our ability to engage with our environments, analyze them, and make efficient, sustainable and equitable decisions, the need for a green AI approach is intensified. This perspective paper, reflecting authors’ opinions and interpretations, concentrates on the “green AI” concept as an enabler of the smart city transformation, as it offers the opportunity to move away from purely technocentric efficiency solutions towards efficient, sustainable and equitable solutions capable of realizing the desired urban futures. The aim of this perspective paper is two-fold: first, to highlight the fundamental shortfalls in mainstream AI system conceptualization and practice, and second, to advocate the need for a consolidated AI approach—i.e., green AI—to further support smart city transformation. The methodological approach includes a thorough appraisal of the current AI and smart city literatures, practices, developments, trends and applications. The paper informs authorities and planners on the importance of the adoption and deployment of AI systems that address efficiency, sustainability and equity issues in cities.",

    "title": "Actions and Events in Interval Temporal Logic",
    "abstract": "We present a representation of events and action based on interval temporal logic that is significantly more expressive and more natural than most previous AI approaches. The representation is motivated by work in natural language semantics and discourse, temporal logic, and AI planning and plan recognition. The formal basis of the representation is presented in detail, from the axiomatization of time periods to the relationship between actions and events and their effects. The power of the representation is illustrated by applying it to the axiomatization and solution of several standard problems from the AI literature on action and change. An approach to the frame problem based on explanation closure is shown to be both powerful and natural when combined with our representational framework. We also discuss features of the logic that are beyond the scope of many traditional representations, and describe our approach to difficult problems such as external events and simultaneous actions.",

    "title": "External Evaluation of 3 Commercial Artificial Intelligence Algorithms for Independent Assessment of Screening Mammograms.",
    "abstract": "Importance\nA computer algorithm that performs at or above the level of radiologists in mammography screening assessment could improve the effectiveness of breast cancer screening.\n\n\nObjective\nTo perform an external evaluation of 3 commercially available artificial intelligence (AI) computer-aided detection algorithms as independent mammography readers and to assess the screening performance when combined with radiologists.\n\n\nDesign, Setting, and Participants\nThis retrospective case-control study was based on a double-reader population-based mammography screening cohort of women screened at an academic hospital in Stockholm, Sweden, from 2008 to 2015. The study included 8805 women aged 40 to 74 years who underwent mammography screening and who did not have implants or prior breast cancer. The study sample included 739 women who were diagnosed as having breast cancer (positive) and a random sample of 8066 healthy controls (negative for breast cancer).\n\n\nMain Outcomes and Measures\nPositive follow-up findings were determined by pathology-verified diagnosis at screening or within 12 months thereafter. Negative follow-up findings were determined by a 2-year cancer-free follow-up. Three AI computer-aided detection algorithms (AI-1, AI-2, and AI-3), sourced from different vendors, yielded a continuous score for the suspicion of cancer in each mammography examination. For a decision of normal or abnormal, the cut point was defined by the mean specificity of the first-reader radiologists (96.6%).\n\n\nResults\nThe median age of study participants was 60 years (interquartile range, 50-66 years) for 739 women who received a diagnosis of breast cancer and 54 years (interquartile range, 47-63 years) for 8066 healthy controls. The cases positive for cancer comprised 618 (84%) screen detected and 121 (16%) clinically detected within 12 months of the screening examination. The area under the receiver operating curve for cancer detection was 0.956 (95% CI, 0.948-0.965) for AI-1, 0.922 (95% CI, 0.910-0.934) for AI-2, and 0.920 (95% CI, 0.909-0.931) for AI-3. At the specificity of the radiologists, the sensitivities were 81.9% for AI-1, 67.0% for AI-2, 67.4% for AI-3, 77.4% for first-reader radiologist, and 80.1% for second-reader radiologist. Combining AI-1 with first-reader radiologists achieved 88.6% sensitivity at 93.0% specificity (abnormal defined by either of the 2 making an abnormal assessment). No other examined combination of AI algorithms and radiologists surpassed this sensitivity level.\n\n\nConclusions and Relevance\nTo our knowledge, this study is the first independent evaluation of several AI computer-aided detection algorithms for screening mammography. The results of this study indicated that a commercially available AI computer-aided detection algorithm can assess screening mammograms with a sufficient diagnostic performance to be further evaluated as an independent reader in prospective clinical trials. Combining the first readers with the best algorithm identified more cases positive for cancer than combining the first readers with second readers.",

    "title": "Transparency and trust in artificial intelligence systems",
    "abstract": "ABSTRACT Assistive technology featuring artificial intelligence (AI) to support human decision-making has become ubiquitous. Assistive AI achieves accuracy comparable to or even surpassing that of human experts. However, often the adoption of assistive AI systems is limited by a lack of trust of humans into an AI’s prediction. This is why the AI research community has been focusing on rendering AI decisions more transparent by providing explanations of an AIs decision. To what extent these explanations really help to foster trust into an AI system remains an open question. In this paper, we report the results of a behavioural experiment in which subjects were able to draw on the support of an ML-based decision support tool for text classification. We experimentally varied the information subjects received and show that transparency can actually have a negative impact on trust. We discuss implications for decision makers employing assistive AI technology.",

    "abstract": "Importance\nThe use of artificial intelligence (AI) is expanding throughout the field of medicine. In dermatology, researchers are evaluating the potential for direct-to-patient and clinician decision-support AI tools to classify skin lesions. Although AI is poised to change how patients engage in health care, patient perspectives remain poorly understood.\n\n\nObjective\nTo explore how patients conceptualize AI and perceive the use of AI for skin cancer screening.\n\n\nDesign, Setting, and Participants\nA qualitative study using a grounded theory approach to semistructured interview analysis was conducted in general dermatology clinics at the Brigham and Women's Hospital and melanoma clinics at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute. Forty-eight patients were enrolled. Each interview was independently coded by 2 researchers with interrater reliability measurement; reconciled codes were used to assess code frequency. The study was conducted from May 6 to July 8, 2019.\n\n\nMain Outcomes and Measures\nArtificial intelligence concept, perceived benefits and risks of AI, strengths and weaknesses of AI, AI implementation, response to conflict between human and AI clinical decision-making, and recommendation for or against AI.\n\n\nResults\nOf 48 patients enrolled, 26 participants (54%) were women; mean (SD) age was 53.3 (21.7) years. Sixteen patients (33%) had a history of melanoma, 16 patients (33%) had a history of nonmelanoma skin cancer only, and 16 patients (33%) had no history of skin cancer. Twenty-four patients were interviewed about a direct-to-patient AI tool and 24 patients were interviewed about a clinician decision-support AI tool. Interrater reliability ratings for the 2 coding teams were κ = 0.94 and κ = 0.89. Patients primarily conceptualized AI in terms of cognition. Increased diagnostic speed (29 participants [60%]) and health care access (29 [60%]) were the most commonly perceived benefits of AI for skin cancer screening; increased patient anxiety was the most commonly perceived risk (19 [40%]). Patients perceived both more accurate diagnosis (33 [69%]) and less accurate diagnosis (41 [85%]) to be the greatest strength and weakness of AI, respectively. The dominant theme that emerged was the importance of symbiosis between humans and AI (45 [94%]). Seeking biopsy was the most common response to conflict between human and AI clinical decision-making (32 [67%]). Overall, 36 patients (75%) would recommend AI to family members and friends.\n\n\nConclusions and Relevance\nIn this qualitative study, patients appeared to be receptive to the use of AI for skin cancer screening if implemented in a manner that preserves the integrity of the human physician-patient relationship.",

    "title": "Government by Algorithm: Artificial Intelligence in Federal Administrative Agencies",
    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) promises to transform how government agencies do their work. Rapid developments in AI have the potential to reduce the cost of core governance functions, improve the quality of decisions, and unleash the power of administrative data, thereby making government performance more efficient and effective. Agencies that use AI to realize these gains will also confront important questions about the proper design of algorithms and user interfaces, the respective scope of human and machine decision-making, the boundaries between public actions and private contracting, their own capacity to learn over time using AI, and whether the use of AI is even permitted. \n \nThese are important issues for public debate and academic inquiry. Yet little is known about how agencies are currently using AI systems beyond a few headline-grabbing examples or surface-level descriptions. Moreover, even amidst growing public and scholarly discussion about how society might regulate government use of AI, little attention has been devoted to how agencies acquire such tools in the first place or oversee their use. In an effort to fill these gaps, the Administrative Conference of the United States (ACUS) commissioned this report from researchers at Stanford University and New York University. The research team included a diverse set of lawyers, law students, computer scientists, and social scientists with the capacity to analyze these cutting-edge issues from technical, legal, and policy angles. The resulting report offers three cuts at federal agency use of AI: \n \n(i) a rigorous canvass of AI use at the 142 most significant federal departments, agencies, and sub-agencies (Part I) \n \n(ii) a series of in-depth but accessible case studies of specific AI applications at eight leading agencies (SEC, CPB, SSA, USPTO, FDA, FCC, CFPB, USPS) covering a range of governance tasks (Part II); and \n \n(iii) a set of cross-cutting analyses of the institutional, legal, and policy challenges raised by agency use of AI (Part III).",

    "title": "Are We Ready to Integrate Artificial Intelligence Literacy into Medical School Curriculum: Students and Faculty Survey",
    "abstract": "Background: The effects of Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology applications are already felt in healthcare in general and in the practice of medicine in the disciplines of radiology, pathology, ophthalmology, and oncology. The expanding interface between digital data science, emerging AI technologies and healthcare is creating a demand for AI technology literacy in health professions. Objective: To assess medical student and faculty attitudes toward AI, in preparation for teaching AI foundations and data science applications in clinical practice in an integrated medical education curriculum. Methods: An online 15-question semi-structured survey was distributed among medical students and faculty. The questionnaire consisted of 3 parts: participant’s background, AI awareness, and attitudes toward AI applications in medicine. Results: A total of 121 medical students and 52 clinical faculty completed the survey. Only 30% of students and 50% of faculty responded that they were aware of AI topics in medicine. The majority of students (72%) and faculty (59%) learned about AI from the media. Faculty were more likely to report that they did not have a basic understanding of AI technologies (χ2, P = .031). Students were more interested in AI in patient care training, while faculty were more interested in AI in teaching training (χ2, P = .001). Additionally, students and faculty reported comparable attitudes toward AI, limited AI literacy and time constraints in the curriculum. There is interest in broad and deep AI topics. Our findings in medical learners and teaching faculty parallel other published professional groups’ AI survey results. Conclusions: The survey conclusively proved interest among medical students and faculty in AI technology in general, and in its applications in healthcare and medicine. The study was conducted at a single institution. This survey serves as a foundation for other medical schools interested in developing a collaborative programming approach to address AI literacy in medical education.",

    "abstract": "N-acylhomoserine lactones, known as autoinducers (AIs), are widely conserved signal molecules present in quorum-sensing systems of many gram-negative bacteria. AIs are involved in the regulation of diverse biological functions, including expression of pathogenic genes in the plant pathogens Pseudomonas solanacearum, several Erwinia species, and the human pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa. A bacterial isolate, Bacillus sp. 240B1, is capable of enzymatic inactivation of AIs. The gene (aiiA) for AI inactivation from Bacillus sp. 240B1 has been cloned and shown to encode a protein of 250 amino acids. Sequence alignment indicates that AiiA contains a \"HXHXDH\" zinc-binding motif that is conserved in several groups of metallohydrolases. Site-directed mutagenesis showed that conserved aspartate and most histidine residues are required for AiiA activity. Expression of aiiA in transformed Erwinia carotovora strain SCG1 significantly reduces the release of AI, decreases extracellular pectolytic enzyme activities, and attenuates pathogenicity on potato, eggplant, Chinese cabbage, carrot, celery, cauliflower, and tobacco. Our results indicate that the AI-inactivation approach represents a promising strategy for prevention of diseases in which virulence is regulated by AIs.",

    "title": "Amelogenesis Imperfecta; Genes, Proteins, and Pathways",
    "abstract": "Amelogenesis imperfecta (AI) is the name given to a heterogeneous group of conditions characterized by inherited developmental enamel defects. AI enamel is abnormally thin, soft, fragile, pitted and/or badly discolored, with poor function and aesthetics, causing patients problems such as early tooth loss, severe embarrassment, eating difficulties, and pain. It was first described separately from diseases of dentine nearly 80 years ago, but the underlying genetic and mechanistic basis of the condition is only now coming to light. Mutations in the gene AMELX, encoding an extracellular matrix protein secreted by ameloblasts during enamel formation, were first identified as a cause of AI in 1991. Since then, mutations in at least eighteen genes have been shown to cause AI presenting in isolation of other health problems, with many more implicated in syndromic AI. Some of the encoded proteins have well documented roles in amelogenesis, acting as enamel matrix proteins or the proteases that degrade them, cell adhesion molecules or regulators of calcium homeostasis. However, for others, function is less clear and further research is needed to understand the pathways and processes essential for the development of healthy enamel. Here, we review the genes and mutations underlying AI presenting in isolation of other health problems, the proteins they encode and knowledge of their roles in amelogenesis, combining evidence from human phenotypes, inheritance patterns, mouse models, and in vitro studies. An LOVD resource (http://dna2.leeds.ac.uk/LOVD/) containing all published gene mutations for AI presenting in isolation of other health problems is described. We use this resource to identify trends in the genes and mutations reported to cause AI in the 270 families for which molecular diagnoses have been reported by 23rd May 2017. Finally we discuss the potential value of the translation of AI genetics to clinical care with improved patient pathways and speculate on the possibility of novel treatments and prevention strategies for AI.",

    "title": "Artificial Intelligence Coaches for Sales Agents: Caveats and Solutions",
    "abstract": "Firms are exploiting artificial intelligence (AI) coaches to provide training to sales agents and improve their job skills. The authors present several caveats associated with such practices based on a series of randomized field experiments. Experiment 1 shows that the incremental benefit of the AI coach over human managers is heterogeneous across agents in an inverted-U shape: whereas middle-ranked agents improve their performance by the largest amount, both bottom- and top-ranked agents show limited incremental gains. This pattern is driven by a learning-based mechanism in which bottom-ranked agents encounter the most severe information overload problem with the AI versus human coach, while top-ranked agents hold the strongest aversion to the AI relative to a human coach. To alleviate the challenge faced by bottom-ranked agents, Experiment 2 redesigns the AI coach by restricting the training feedback level and shows a significant improvement in agent performance. Experiment 3 reveals that the AI–human coach assemblage outperforms either the AI or human coach alone. This assemblage can harness the hard data skills of the AI coach and soft interpersonal skills of human managers, solving both problems faced by bottom- and top-ranked agents. These findings offer novel insights into AI coaches for researchers and managers alike.",

The evolution of AI makes the analysis of big data possible, which provides reliable information and improves the decision-making process. This article introduces the principles of AI and reviews the development of AI and how it is currently being used. AI technology has influenced the health care field because of the need for accurate diagnosis and superior patient care. In order to understand the trend of AI in dentistry, electronic searching was carried out, combined with approaching individual companies to obtain the details of AI-based services. The current applications of AI in clinical dentistry were introduced and summarized. In the future, the AI-based comprehensive care system is expected to establish high-quality patient care and innovative research and development, facilitating advanced decision support tools. The authors believe that an innovative inter-professional coordination among clinicians, researchers, and engineers will be the key to AI development in the field of dentistry. Despite the potential misinterpretations and the concern of patient privacy, AI will continue to connect with dentistry from a comprehensive perspective due to the need for precise treatment procedures and instant information exchange. Moreover, such developments will enable professionals to share health-related big data and deliver insights that improve patient care through hospitals, providers, researchers, and patients.",

    "abstract": "Background The use of artificial intelligence (AI) in medicine will generate numerous application possibilities to improve patient care, provide real-time data analytics, and enable continuous patient monitoring. Clinicians and health informaticians should become familiar with machine learning and deep learning. Additionally, they should have a strong background in data analytics and data visualization to use, evaluate, and develop AI applications in clinical practice. Objective The main objective of this study was to evaluate the current state of AI training and the use of AI tools to enhance the learning experience. Methods A comprehensive systematic review was conducted to analyze the use of AI in medical and health informatics education, and to evaluate existing AI training practices. PRISMA-P (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis Protocols) guidelines were followed. The studies that focused on the use of AI tools to enhance medical education and the studies that investigated teaching AI as a new competency were categorized separately to evaluate recent developments. Results This systematic review revealed that recent publications recommend the integration of AI training into medical and health informatics curricula. Conclusions To the best of our knowledge, this is the first systematic review exploring the current state of AI education in both medicine and health informatics. Since AI curricula have not been standardized and competencies have not been determined, a framework for specialized AI training in medical and health informatics education is proposed.",

    "title": "The Clinician and Dataset Shift in Artificial Intelligence.",
    "abstract": "To the Editor: Artificial intelligence (AI) systems are now regularly being used in medical settings,1 although regulatory oversight is inconsistent and undeveloped.2,3 Safe deployment of clinical AI requires informed clinician-users, who are generally responsible for identifying and reporting emerging problems. Clinicians may also serve as administrators in governing the use of clinical AI. A natural question follows: are clinicians adequately prepared to identify circumstances in which AI systems fail to perform their intended function reliably? A major driver of AI system malfunction is known as “dataset shift.”4,5 Most clinical AI systems today use machine learning, algorithms that leverage statistical methods to learn key patterns from clinical data. Dataset shift occurs when a machine-learning system underperforms because of a mismatch between the data set with which it was developed and the data on which it is deployed.4 For example, the University of Michigan Hospital implemented the widely used sepsis-alerting model developed by Epic Systems; in April 2020, the model had to be deactivated because of spurious alerting owing to changes in patients’ demographic characteristics associated with the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. This was a case in which dataset shift fundamentally altered the relationship between fevers and bacterial sepsis, leading the hospital’s clinical AI governing committee (which one of the authors of this letter chairs) to decommission its use. This is an extreme example; many causes of dataset shift are more subtle. In Table 1, we present common causes of dataset shift, which we group into changes in technology (e.g., software vendors), changes in population and setting (e.g., new demographics), and changes in behavior (e.g., new reimbursement incentives); the list is not meant to be exhaustive. Successful recognition and mitigation of dataset shift require both vigilant clinicians and sound technical oversight through AI governance teams.4,5 When using an AI system, clinicians should note misalignment between the predictions of the model and their own clinical judgment, as in the sepsis example above. Clinicians who use AI systems must frequently consider whether relevant aspects of their own clinical practice are atypical or have recently changed. For their part, AI governance teams must be sure that it is easy for clinicians to report concerns about the function of AI systems and provide feedback so that the clinician who is reporting will understand that the registered concern has been noted and, if appropriate, actions to mitigate the concern have been taken. Teams must also establish AI monitoring and updating protocols that integrate technical solu-",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) research within medicine is growing rapidly. In 2016, healthcare AI projects attracted more investment than AI projects within any other sector of the global economy.1 However, among the excitement, there is equal scepticism, with some urging caution at inflated expectations.2 This article takes a close look at current trends in medical AI and the future possibilities for general practice.\n\nInforming clinical decision making through insights from past data is the essence of evidence-based medicine. Traditionally, statistical methods have approached this task by characterising patterns within data as mathematical equations, for example, linear regression suggests a ‘line of best fit’. Through ‘machine learning’ (ML), AI provides techniques that uncover complex associations which cannot easily be reduced to an equation. For example, neural networks represent data through vast numbers of interconnected neurones in a similar fashion to the human brain. This allows ML systems to approach complex problem solving just as a clinician might — by carefully weighing evidence to reach reasoned conclusions. However, unlike a single clinician, these systems can simultaneously observe and rapidly process an almost limitless number of inputs. For example, an AI-driven smartphone app now capably handles the task of triaging 1.2 million people in North London to Accident & Emergency (A&E).3 Furthermore, these systems are able to learn from each incremental case and can be exposed, within minutes, to more cases than a clinician could see in many lifetimes. This is why an AI-driven application is able to …",

    "abstract": "Background It is expected that artificial intelligence (AI) will be used extensively in the medical field in the future. Objective The purpose of this study is to investigate the awareness of AI among Korean doctors and to assess physicians’ attitudes toward the medical application of AI. Methods We conducted an online survey composed of 11 closed-ended questions using Google Forms. The survey consisted of questions regarding the recognition of and attitudes toward AI, the development direction of AI in medicine, and the possible risks of using AI in the medical field. Results A total of 669 participants completed the survey. Only 40 (5.9%) answered that they had good familiarity with AI. However, most participants considered AI useful in the medical field (558/669, 83.4% agreement). The advantage of using AI was seen as the ability to analyze vast amounts of high-quality, clinically relevant data in real time. Respondents agreed that the area of medicine in which AI would be most useful is disease diagnosis (558/669, 83.4% agreement). One possible problem cited by the participants was that AI would not be able to assist in unexpected situations owing to inadequate information (196/669, 29.3%). Less than half of the participants(294/669, 43.9%) agreed that AI is diagnostically superior to human doctors. Only 237 (35.4%) answered that they agreed that AI could replace them in their jobs. Conclusions This study suggests that Korean doctors and medical students have favorable attitudes toward AI in the medical field. The majority of physicians surveyed believed that AI will not replace their roles in the future.",

    "title": "Artificial intelligence to diagnose ischemic stroke and identify large vessel occlusions: a systematic review",
    "abstract": "Background and purpose Acute stroke caused by large vessel occlusions (LVOs) requires emergent detection and treatment by endovascular thrombectomy. However, radiologic LVO detection and treatment is subject to variable delays and human expertise, resulting in morbidity. Imaging software using artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML), a branch of AI, may improve rapid frontline detection of LVO strokes. This report is a systematic review of AI in acute LVO stroke identification and triage, and characterizes LVO detection software. Methods A systematic review of acute stroke diagnostic-focused AI studies from January 2014 to February 2019 in PubMed, Medline, and Embase using terms: ‘artificial intelligence’ or ‘machine learning or deep learning’ and ‘ischemic stroke’ or ‘large vessel occlusion’ was performed. Results Variations of AI, including ML methods of random forest learning (RFL) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs), are used to detect LVO strokes. Twenty studies were identified that use ML. Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score (ASPECTS) commonly used RFL, while LVO detection typically used CNNs. Image feature detection had greater sensitivity with CNN than with RFL, 85% versus 68%. However, AI algorithm performance metrics use different standards, precluding ideal objective comparison. Four current software platforms incorporate ML: Brainomix (greatest validation of AI for ASPECTS, uses CNNs to automatically detect LVOs), General Electric, iSchemaView (largest number of perfusion study validations for thrombectomy), and Viz.ai (uses CNNs to automatically detect LVOs, then automatically activates emergency stroke treatment systems). Conclusions AI may improve LVO stroke detection and rapid triage necessary for expedited treatment. Standardization of performance assessment is needed in future studies.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Objective To examine the accuracy of artificial intelligence (AI) for the detection of breast cancer in mammography screening practice. Design Systematic review of test accuracy studies. Data sources Medline, Embase, Web of Science, and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews from 1 January 2010 to 17 May 2021. Eligibility criteria Studies reporting test accuracy of AI algorithms, alone or in combination with radiologists, to detect cancer in women’s digital mammograms in screening practice, or in test sets. Reference standard was biopsy with histology or follow-up (for screen negative women). Outcomes included test accuracy and cancer type detected. Study selection and synthesis Two reviewers independently assessed articles for inclusion and assessed the methodological quality of included studies using the QUality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-2 (QUADAS-2) tool. A single reviewer extracted data, which were checked by a second reviewer. Narrative data synthesis was performed. Results Twelve studies totalling 131 822 screened women were included. No prospective studies measuring test accuracy of AI in screening practice were found. Studies were of poor methodological quality. Three retrospective studies compared AI systems with the clinical decisions of the original radiologist, including 79 910 women, of whom 1878 had screen detected cancer or interval cancer within 12 months of screening. Thirty four (94%) of 36 AI systems evaluated in these studies were less accurate than a single radiologist, and all were less accurate than consensus of two or more radiologists. Five smaller studies (1086 women, 520 cancers) at high risk of bias and low generalisability to the clinical context reported that all five evaluated AI systems (as standalone to replace radiologist or as a reader aid) were more accurate than a single radiologist reading a test set in the laboratory. In three studies, AI used for triage screened out 53%, 45%, and 50% of women at low risk but also 10%, 4%, and 0% of cancers detected by radiologists. Conclusions Current evidence for AI does not yet allow judgement of its accuracy in breast cancer screening programmes, and it is unclear where on the clinical pathway AI might be of most benefit. AI systems are not sufficiently specific to replace radiologist double reading in screening programmes. Promising results in smaller studies are not replicated in larger studies. Prospective studies are required to measure the effect of AI in clinical practice. Such studies will require clear stopping rules to ensure that AI does not reduce programme specificity.

    "abstract": "This conceptual paper addresses the issues of transparency as linked to artificial intelligence (AI) from socio-legal and computer scientific perspectives. Firstly, we discuss the conceptual distinction between transparency in AI and algorithmic transparency, and argue for the wider concept ‘in AI’, as a partly contested albeit useful notion in relation to transparency. Secondly, we show that transparency as a general concept is multifaceted, and of widespread theoretical use in multiple disciplines over time, particularly since the 1990s. Still, it has had a resurgence in contemporary notions of AI governance, such as in the multitude of recently published ethics guidelines on AI. Thirdly, we discuss and show the relevance of the fact that transparency expresses a conceptual metaphor of more general significance, linked to knowing, bringing positive connotations that may have normative effects to regulatory debates. Finally, we draw a possible categorisation of aspects related to transparency in AI, or what we interchangeably call AI transparency, and argue for the need of developing a multidisciplinary understanding, in order to contribute to the governance of AI as applied on markets and in society.

    "title": "Artificial Intelligence Based MPPT Techniques for Solar Power System: A review",
    "abstract": "—— In the last decade, artificial intelligence (AI) tech ‐ niques have been extensively used for maximum power point tracking (MPPT) in the solar power system. This is because con ‐ ventional MPPT techniques are incapable of tracking the global maximum power point (GMPP) under partial shading condition (PSC). The output curve of the power versus voltage for a solar panel has only one GMPP and multiple local maximum power points (MPPs). The integration of AI in MPPT is crucial to guarantee the tracking of GMPP while increasing the overall ef ‐ ficiency and performance of MPPT. The selection of AI-based MPPT techniques is complicated because each technique has its own merits and demerits. In general, all of the AI-based MPPT techniques exhibit fast convergence speed, less steady-state oscil ‐ lation and high efficiency, compared with the conventional MPPT techniques. However, the AI-based MPPT techniques are computationally intensive and costly to realize. Overall, the hy ‐ brid MPPT is favorable in terms of the balance between perfor ‐ mance and complexity, and it combines the advantages of con ‐ ventional and AI-based MPPT techniques. In this paper, a de ‐ tailed comparison of classification and performance between 6 major AI-based MPPT techniques have been made based on the review and MATLAB/Simulink simulation results. The mer ‐ its, open issues and technical implementations of AI-based MPPT techniques are evaluated. We intend to provide new in ‐ sights into the choice of optimal AI-based MPPT techniques.",

    "title": "Artificial intelligence for polyp detection during colonoscopy: a systematic review and meta-analysis",
    "abstract": "Abstract Background Artificial intelligence (AI)-based polyp detection systems are used during colonoscopy with the aim of increasing lesion detection and improving colonoscopy quality. Patients and methods: We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of prospective trials to determine the value of AI-based polyp detection systems for detection of polyps and colorectal cancer. We performed systematic searches in MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane CENTRAL. Independent reviewers screened studies and assessed eligibility, certainty of evidence, and risk of bias. We compared colonoscopy with and without AI by calculating relative and absolute risks and mean differences for detection of polyps, adenomas, and colorectal cancer. Results Five randomized trials were eligible for analysis. Colonoscopy with AI increased adenoma detection rates (ADRs) and polyp detection rates (PDRs) compared to colonoscopy without AI (values given with 95 %CI). ADR with AI was 29.6 % (22.2 % – 37.0 %) versus 19.3 % (12.7 % – 25.9 %) without AI; relative risk (RR] 1.52 (1.31 – 1.77), with high certainty. PDR was 45.4 % (41.1 % – 49.8 %) with AI versus 30.6 % (26.5 % – 34.6 %) without AI; RR 1.48 (1.37 – 1.60), with high certainty. There was no difference in detection of advanced adenomas (mean advanced adenomas per colonoscopy 0.03 for each group, high certainty). Mean adenomas detected per colonoscopy was higher for small adenomas (≤ 5 mm) for AI versus non-AI (mean difference 0.15 [0.12 – 0.18]), but not for larger adenomas (> 5 – ≤ 10 mm, mean difference 0.03 [0.01 – 0.05]; > 10 mm, mean difference 0.01 [0.00 – 0.02]; high certainty). Data on cancer are unavailable. Conclusions AI-based polyp detection systems during colonoscopy increase detection of small nonadvanced adenomas and polyps, but not of advanced adenomas.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) is currently viewed as the most important and disruptive new technology for large organizations. However, the technology is still in a relatively early state in large enterprises, and largely absent from smaller ones other than technology startups. Surveys suggest that fewer than half of large organizations have meaningful AI initiatives underway, although the percentage is increasing over time. This essay titled “AI in organizations: current state and future opportunities” details current challenges and implications that might arise from AI applications, and the ways to overcome such challenges to realize the potential of this emerging technology. First, the paper provide a brief history of AI and an overview of AI typologies. We discuss current challenges, implications and future opportunities regarding AI. Finally, we summarize the special issue articles and highlight the contributions each makes.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) has been altering industries as evidenced by Airbnb, Uber and other companies that have embraced its use to implement innovative new business models. Yet we may not fully understand how this emerging and rapidly advancing technology influences business model innovation. While many companies are being made vulnerable to new competitors equipped with AI technology, this study attempts to focus on the proactive side of the use of AI technology to drive business model innovation. Describing AI technology as the catalyst of business model innovation, this study sheds light on contingent factors shaping business model innovation initiated by the emerging technology. This study first provides a brief overview of AI, current issues being tackled in developing AI and explains how it transforms business models. Our case study of two companies that innovated their business models using AI shows its potential impact. We also discuss how executives can create an innovative AI-based culture, which rephrases the process of AI-based business model innovation. Companies that successfully capitalize on AI can create disruptive innovation through their new business models and processes, enabling them to potentially transform the global competitive landscape.",

Now, users can even collaborate with AI in creative activities such as art. To understand the user experience in this new user--AI collaboration, we designed a prototype, DuetDraw, an AI interface that allows users and the AI agent to draw pictures collaboratively. We conducted a user study employing both quantitative and qualitative methods. Thirty participants performed a series of drawing tasks with the think-aloud method, followed by post-hoc surveys and interviews. Our findings are as follows: (1) Users were significantly more content with DuetDraw when the tool gave detailed instructions. (2) While users always wanted to lead the task, they also wanted the AI to explain its intentions but only when the users wanted it to do so. (3) Although users rated the AI relatively low in predictability, controllability, and comprehensibility, they enjoyed their interactions with it during the task. Based on these findings, we discuss implications for user interfaces where users can collaborate with AI in creative works.",

AI describes people's varying response intensity to identical emotional stimuli. A college sample of 66 women and 34 men was assessed on both positive and negative affect using 4 measurement methods: self-report, peer report, daily report, and memory performance. A principal-components analysis revealed an affect balance component and an AI component. Multimeasure affect balance and AI scores were created, and t tests were computed that showed women to be as happy as and more intense than men. Gender accounted for less than 1% of the variance in happiness but over 13% in AI. Thus, depression findings of more negative affect in women do not conflict with well-being findings of equal happiness across gender. Generally, women's more intense positive emotions balance their higher negative affect.",

    "title": "The Sustainability of Artificial Intelligence: An Urbanistic Viewpoint from the Lens of Smart and Sustainable Cities",
    "abstract": "The popularity and application of artificial intelligence (AI) are increasing rapidly all around the world—where, in simple terms, AI is a technology which mimics the behaviors commonly associated with human intelligence. Today, various AI applications are being used in areas ranging from marketing to banking and finance, from agriculture to healthcare and security, from space exploration to robotics and transport, and from chatbots to artificial creativity and manufacturing. More recently, AI applications have also started to become an integral part of many urban services. Urban artificial intelligences manage the transport systems of cities, run restaurants and shops where every day urbanity is expressed, repair urban infrastructure, and govern multiple urban domains such as traffic, air quality monitoring, garbage collection, and energy. In the age of uncertainty and complexity that is upon us, the increasing adoption of AI is expected to continue, and so its impact on the sustainability of our cities. This viewpoint explores and questions the sustainability of AI from the lens of smart and sustainable cities, and generates insights into emerging urban artificial intelligences and the potential symbiosis between AI and a smart and sustainable urbanism. In terms of methodology, this viewpoint deploys a thorough review of the current status of AI and smart and sustainable cities literature, research, developments, trends, and applications. In so doing, it contributes to existing academic debates in the fields of smart and sustainable cities and AI. In addition, by shedding light on the uptake of AI in cities, the viewpoint seeks to help urban policymakers, planners, and citizens make informed decisions about a sustainable adoption of AI.",

    "abstract": "5G wireless communication networks are currently being deployed, and B5G networks are expected to be developed over the next decade. AI technologies and, in particular, ML have the potential to efficiently solve the unstructured and seemingly intractable problems by involving large amounts of data that need to be dealt with in B5G. This article studies how AI and ML can be leveraged for the design and operation of B5G networks. We first provide a comprehensive survey of recent advances and future challenges that result from bringing AI/ML technologies into B5G wireless networks. Our survey touches on different aspects of wireless network design and optimization, including channel measurements, modeling, and estimation, physical layer research, and network management and optimization. Then ML algorithms and applications to B5G networks are reviewed, followed by an overview of standard developments of applying AI/ML algorithms to B5G networks. We conclude this study with future challenges on applying AI/ML to B5G networks.",

    "abstract": "Little by little, newspapers are revealing the bright future that Artificial Intelligence (AI) is building. Intelligent machines will help everywhere. However, this bright future has a dark side: a dramatic job market contraction before its unpredictable transformation. Hence, in a near future, large numbers of job seekers will need financial support while catching up with these novel unpredictable jobs. This possible job market crisis has an antidote inside. In fact, the rise of AI is sustained by the biggest knowledge theft of the recent years. Learning AI machines are extracting knowledge from unaware skilled or unskilled workers by analyzing their interactions. By passionately doing their jobs, these workers are digging their own graves. \nIn this paper, we propose Human-in-the-loop Artificial Intelligence (HIT-AI) as a fairer paradigm for Artificial Intelligence systems. HIT-AI will reward aware and unaware knowledge producers with a different scheme: decisions of AI systems generating revenues will repay the legitimate owners of the knowledge used for taking those decisions. As modern Robin Hoods, HIT-AI researchers should fight for a fairer Artificial Intelligence that gives back what it steals.",

    "abstract": "Recent advances in communication technologies and the Internet-of-Medical-Things (IOMT) have transformed smart healthcare enabled by artificial intelligence (AI). Traditionally, AI techniques require centralized data collection and processing that may be infeasible in realistic healthcare scenarios due to the high scalability of modern healthcare networks and growing data privacy concerns. Federated Learning (FL), as an emerging distributed collaborative AI paradigm, is particularly attractive for smart healthcare, by coordinating multiple clients (e.g., hospitals) to perform AI training without sharing raw data. Accordingly, we provide a comprehensive survey on the use of FL in smart healthcare. First, we present the recent advances in FL, the motivations, and the requirements of using FL in smart healthcare. The recent FL designs for smart healthcare are then discussed, ranging from resource-aware FL, secure and privacy-aware FL to incentive FL and personalized FL. Subsequently, we provide a state-of-the-art review on the emerging applications of FL in key healthcare domains, including health data management, remote health monitoring, medical imaging, and COVID-19 detection. Several recent FL-based smart healthcare projects are analyzed, and the key lessons learned from the survey are also highlighted. Finally, we discuss interesting research challenges and possible directions for future FL research in smart healthcare.",

AI might also be used to establish prognoses of patients or predict their response to treatments, based on multiple factors. We review the ways in which AI may help physicians make a diagnosis or establish a prognosis and discuss its limitations, knowing that further randomized controlled studies will be required before the approval of AI techniques by the health authorities.",

    "title": "American Indian and Alaska Native mental health: diverse perspectives on enduring disparities.",
    "abstract": "As descendants of the indigenous peoples of the United States, American Indians and Alaska Natives (AI/ANs) have experienced a resurgence in population and prospects since the beginning of the twentieth century. Today, tribally affiliated individuals number over two million, distributed across 565 federally recognized tribal communities and countless metropolitan and nonreservation rural areas. Although relatively little evidence is available, the existing data suggest that AI/AN adults and youth suffer a disproportionate burden of mental health problems compared with other Americans. Specifically, clear disparities have emerged for AI/AN substance abuse, posttraumatic stress, violence, and suicide. The rapid expansion of mental health services to AI/AN communities has, however, frequently preceded careful consideration of a variety of questions about critical components of such care, such as the service delivery structure itself, clinical treatment processes, and preventive and rehabilitative program evaluation. As a consequence, the mental health needs of these communities have easily outpaced and overwhelmed the federally funded agency designed to serve these populations, with the Indian Health Service remaining chronically understaffed and underfunded such that elimination of AI/AN mental health disparities is only a distant dream. Although research published during the past decade has substantially improved knowledge about AI/AN mental health problems, far fewer investigations have explored treatment efficacy and outcomes among these culturally diverse peoples. In addition to routine calls for greater clinical and research resources, however, AI/AN community members themselves are increasingly advocating for culturally alternative approaches and opportunities to address their mental health needs on their own terms.",

    "title": "The Application of Medical Artificial Intelligence Technology in Rural Areas of Developing Countries",
    "abstract": "Abstract Background: Artificial intelligence (AI) is a rapidly developing computer technology that has begun to be widely used in the medical field to improve the professional level and efficiency of clinical work, in addition to avoiding medical errors. In developing countries, the inequality between urban and rural health services is a serious problem, of which the shortage of qualified healthcare providers is the major cause of the unavailability and low quality of healthcare in rural areas. Some studies have shown that the application of computer-assisted or AI medical techniques could improve healthcare outcomes in rural areas of developing countries. Therefore, the development of suitable medical AI technology for rural areas is worth discussing and probing. Methods: This article reviews and discusses the literature concerning the prospects of medical AI technology, the inequity of healthcare, and the application of computer-assisted or AI medical techniques in rural areas of developing countries. Results: Medical AI technology not only could improve physicians' efficiency and quality of medical services, but other health workers could also be trained to use this technique to compensate for the lack of physicians, thereby improving the availability of healthcare access and medical service quality. This article proposes a multilevel medical AI service network, including a frontline medical AI system (basic level), regional medical AI support centers (middle levels), and a national medical AI development center (top level). Conclusion: The promotion of medical AI technology in rural areas of developing countries might be one means of alleviating the inequality between urban and rural health services. The establishment of a multilevel medical AI service network system may be a solution.",

    "title": "Three Parallel Quorum-Sensing Systems Regulate Gene Expression in Vibrio harveyi",
    "abstract": "ABSTRACT In a process called quorum sensing, bacteria communicate using extracellular signal molecules termed autoinducers. Two parallel quorum-sensing systems have been identified in the marine bacterium Vibrio harveyi. System 1 consists of the LuxM-dependent autoinducer HAI-1 and the HAI-1 sensor, LuxN. System 2 consists of the LuxS-dependent autoinducer AI-2 and the AI-2 detector, LuxPQ. The related bacterium, Vibrio cholerae, a human pathogen, possesses System 2 (LuxS, AI-2, and LuxPQ) but does not have obvious homologues of V. harveyi System 1. Rather, System 1 of V. cholerae is made up of the CqsA-dependent autoinducer CAI-1 and a sensor called CqsS. Using a V. cholerae CAI-1 reporter strain we show that many other marine bacteria, including V. harveyi, produce CAI-1 activity. Genetic analysis of V. harveyi reveals cqsA and cqsS, and phenotypic analysis of V. harveyi cqsA and cqsS mutants shows that these functions comprise a third V. harveyi quorum-sensing system that acts in parallel to Systems 1 and 2. Together these communication systems act as a three-way coincidence detector in the regulation of a variety of genes, including those responsible for bioluminescence, type III secretion, and metalloprotease production.",

    "title": "Artificial Intelligence Versus Clinicians in Disease Diagnosis: Systematic Review",
    "abstract": "Background Artificial intelligence (AI) has been extensively used in a range of medical fields to promote therapeutic development. The development of diverse AI techniques has also contributed to early detections, disease diagnoses, and referral management. However, concerns about the value of advanced AI in disease diagnosis have been raised by health care professionals, medical service providers, and health policy decision makers. Objective This review aimed to systematically examine the literature, in particular, focusing on the performance comparison between advanced AI and human clinicians to provide an up-to-date summary regarding the extent of the application of AI to disease diagnoses. By doing so, this review discussed the relationship between the current advanced AI development and clinicians with respect to disease diagnosis and thus therapeutic development in the long run. Methods We systematically searched articles published between January 2000 and March 2019 following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analysis in the following databases: Scopus, PubMed, CINAHL, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library. According to the preset inclusion and exclusion criteria, only articles comparing the medical performance between advanced AI and human experts were considered. Results A total of 9 articles were identified. A convolutional neural network was the commonly applied advanced AI technology. Owing to the variation in medical fields, there is a distinction between individual studies in terms of classification, labeling, training process, dataset size, and algorithm validation of AI. Performance indices reported in articles included diagnostic accuracy, weighted errors, false-positive rate, sensitivity, specificity, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. The results showed that the performance of AI was at par with that of clinicians and exceeded that of clinicians with less experience. Conclusions Current AI development has a diagnostic performance that is comparable with medical experts, especially in image recognition-related fields. Further studies can be extended to other types of medical imaging such as magnetic resonance imaging and other medical practices unrelated to images. With the continued development of AI-assisted technologies, the clinical implications underpinned by clinicians’ experience and guided by patient-centered health care principle should be constantly considered in future AI-related and other technology-based medical research.",

    "title": "Constitutional democracy and technology in the age of artificial intelligence",
    "abstract": "Given the foreseeable pervasiveness of artificial intelligence (AI) in modern societies, it is legitimate and necessary to ask the question how this new technology must be shaped to support the maintenance and strengthening of constitutional democracy. This paper first describes the four core elements of today's digital power concentration, which need to be seen in cumulation and which, seen together, are both a threat to democracy and to functioning markets. It then recalls the experience with the lawless Internet and the relationship between technology and the law as it has developed in the Internet economy and the experience with GDPR before it moves on to the key question for AI in democracy, namely which of the challenges of AI can be safely and with good conscience left to ethics, and which challenges of AI need to be addressed by rules which are enforceable and encompass the legitimacy of democratic process, thus laws. The paper closes with a call for a new culture of incorporating the principles of democracy, rule of law and human rights by design in AI and a three-level technological impact assessment for new technologies like AI as a practical way forward for this purpose. This article is part of a theme issue ‘Governing artificial intelligence: ethical, legal, and technical opportunities and challenges’.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) is surpassing human performance in a growing number of domains. However, there is limited evidence of its economic effects. Using data from a digital platform, we study a key application of AI: machine translation. We find that the introduction of a new machine translation system has significantly increased international trade on this platform, increasing exports by 10.9%. Furthermore, heterogeneous treatment effects are consistent with a substantial reduction in translation costs. Our results provide causal evidence that language barriers significantly hinder trade and that AI has already begun to improve economic efficiency in at least one domain.

    "title": "Autoinducer 2 Controls Biofilm Formation in Escherichia coli through a Novel Motility Quorum-Sensing Regulator (MqsR, B3022)",
    "abstract": "ABSTRACT The cross-species bacterial communication signal autoinducer 2 (AI-2), produced by the purified enzymes Pfs (nucleosidase) and LuxS (terminal synthase) from S-adenosylhomocysteine, directly increased Escherichia coli biofilm mass 30-fold. Continuous-flow cells coupled with confocal microscopy corroborated these results by showing the addition of AI-2 significantly increased both biofilm mass and thickness and reduced the interstitial space between microcolonies. As expected, the addition of AI-2 to cells which lack the ability to transport AI-2 (lsr null mutant) failed to stimulate biofilm formation. Since the addition of AI-2 increased cell motility through enhanced transcription of five motility genes, we propose that AI-2 stimulates biofilm formation and alters its architecture by stimulating flagellar motion and motility. It was also found that the uncharacterized protein B3022 regulates this AI-2-mediated motility and biofilm phenotype through the two-component motility regulatory system QseBC. Deletion of b3022 abolished motility, which was restored by expressing b3022 in trans. Deletion of b3022 also decreased biofilm formation significantly, relative to the wild-type strain in three media (46 to 74%) in 96-well plates, as well as decreased biomass (8-fold) and substratum coverage (19-fold) in continuous-flow cells with minimal medium (growth rate not altered and biofilm restored by expressing b3022 in trans). Deleting b3022 changed the wild-type biofilm architecture from a thick (54-μm) complex structure to one that contained only a few microcolonies. B3022 positively regulates expression of qseBC, flhD, fliA, and motA, since deleting b3022 decreased their transcription by 61-, 25-, 2.4-, and 18-fold, respectively. Transcriptome analysis also revealed that B3022 induces crl (26-fold) and flhCD (8- to 27-fold). Adding AI-2 (6.4 μM) increased biofilm formation of wild-type K-12 MG1655 but not that of the isogenic b3022, qseBC, fliA, and motA mutants. Adding AI-2 also increased motA transcription for the wild-type strain but did not stimulate motA transcription for the b3022 and qseB mutants. Together, these results indicate AI-2 induces biofilm formation in E. coli through B3022, which then regulates QseBC and motility; hence, b3022 has been renamed the motility quorum-sensing regulator gene (the mqsR gene).",

How will this sharp drop in price impact society? Policy will influence the impact on two key dimensions: diffusion and consequences. First, in addition to subsidies and intellectual property (IP) policy that will influence the diffusion of AI in ways similar to their effect on other technologies, three policy categories—privacy, trade, and liability—may be uniquely salient in their influence on the diffusion patterns of AI. Second, labor and antitrust policies will influence the consequences of AI in terms of employment, inequality, and competition.",

    "title": "Robustness and Explainability of Artificial Intelligence",
    "abstract": "In the light of the recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI), the serious negative consequences of its use for EU citizens and organisations have led to multiple initiatives from the European Commission to set up the principles of a trustworthy and secure AI. Among the identified requirements, the concepts of robustness and explainability of AI systems have emerged as key elements for a future regulation of this technology. This Technical Report by the European Commission Joint Research Centre (JRC) aims to contribute to this movement for the establishment of a sound regulatory framework for AI, by making the connection between the principles embodied in current regulations regarding to the cybersecurity of digital systems and the protection of data, the policy activities concerning AI, and the technical discussions within the scientific community of AI, in particular in the field of machine learning, that is largely at the origin of the recent advancements of this technology. The individual objectives of this report are to provide a policy-oriented description of the current perspectives of AI and its implications in society, an objective view on the current landscape of AI, focusing of the aspects of robustness and explainability. This also include a technical discussion of the current risks associated with AI in terms of security, safety, and data protection, and a presentation of the scientific solutions that are currently under active development in the AI community to mitigate these risks. This report puts forward several policy-related considerations for the attention of policy makers to establish a set of standardisation and certification tools for AI. First, the development of methodologies to evaluate the impacts of AI on society, built on the model of the Data Protection Impact Assessments (DPIA) introduced in the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), is discussed. Secondly, a focus is made on the establishment of methodologies to assess the robustness of systems that would be adapted to the context of use. This would come along with the identification of known vulnerabilities of AI systems, and the technical solutions that have been proposed in the scientific community to address them. Finally, the aspects of transparency and explainability of AI are discussed, including the explainability-by-design approaches for AI models.",

    "title": "Artificial intelligence in medical education",
    "abstract": "Abstract Artificial intelligence (AI) is a growing phenomenon, and will soon facilitate wide-scale changes in many professions, including medical education. In order for medical educators to be properly prepared for AI, they will need to have at least a fundamental knowledge of AI in relation to learning and teaching, and the extent to which it will impact on medical education. This Guide begins by introducing the broad concepts of AI by using fairly well-known examples to illustrate AI’s implications within the context of education. It then considers the impact of AI on medicine and the implications of this impact for educators trying to educate future doctors. Drawing on these strands, it then identifies AI’s direct impact on the methodology and content of medical education, in an attempt to prepare medical educators for the changing demands and opportunities that are about to face them because of AI.",

    "title": "Augmenting Medical Diagnosis Decisions? An Investigation into Physicians' Decision-Making Process with Artificial Intelligence",
    "abstract": "Systems based on artificial intelligence (AI) increasingly support physicians in diagnostic decisions, but they are not without errors and biases. Failure to detect those may result in wrong diagnoses and medical errors. Compared with rule-based systems, however, these systems are less transparent and their errors less predictable. Thus, it is difficult, yet critical, for physicians to carefully evaluate AI advice. This study uncovers the cognitive challenges that medical decision makers face when they receive potentially incorrect advice from AI-based diagnosis systems and must decide whether to follow or reject it. In experiments with 68 novice and 12 experienced physicians, novice physicians with and without clinical experience as well as experienced radiologists made more inaccurate diagnosis decisions when provided with incorrect AI advice than without advice at all. We elicit five decision-making patterns and show that wrong diagnostic decisions often result from shortcomings in utilizing metacognitions related to decision makers’ own reasoning (self-monitoring) and metacognitions related to the AI-based system (system monitoring). As a result, physicians fall for decisions based on beliefs rather than actual data or engage in unsuitably superficial evaluation of the AI advice. Our study has implications for the training of physicians and spotlights the crucial role of human actors in compensating for AI errors.",

    "title": "Artificial Intelligence, Discretion, and Bureaucracy",
    "abstract": "This essay highlights the increasing use of artificial intelligence (AI) in governance and society and explores the relationship between AI, discretion, and bureaucracy. AI is an advanced information communication technology tool (ICT) that changes both the nature of human discretion within a bureaucracy and the structure of bureaucracies. To better understand this relationship, AI, discretion, and bureaucracy are explored in some detail. It is argued that discretion and decision-making are strongly influenced by intelligence, and that improvements in intelligence, such as those that can be found within the field of AI, can help improve the overall quality of administration. Furthermore, the characteristics, strengths, and weaknesses of both human discretion and AI are explored. Once these characteristics are laid out, a further exploration of the role AI may play in bureaucracies and bureaucratic structure is presented, followed by a specific focus on systems-level bureaucracies. In addition, it is argued that task distribution and task characteristics play a large role, along with the organizational and legal context, in whether a task favors human discretion or the use of AI. Complexity and uncertainty are presented as the major defining characteristics for categorizing tasks. Finally, a discussion is provided about the important cautions and concerns of utilizing AI in governance, in particular, with respect to existential risk and administrative evil.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVES\nWe present regional patterns and trends in all-cause mortality and leading causes of death in American Indians and Alaska Natives (AI/ANs).\n\n\nMETHODS\nUS National Death Index records were linked with Indian Health Service (IHS) registration records to identify AI/AN deaths misclassified as non-AI/AN. We analyzed temporal trends for 1990 to 2009 and comparisons between non-Hispanic AI/AN and non-Hispanic White persons by geographic region for 1999 to 2009. Results focus on IHS Contract Health Service Delivery Area counties in which less race misclassification occurs.\n\n\nRESULTS\nFrom 1990 to 2009 AI/AN persons did not experience the significant decreases in all-cause mortality seen for Whites. For 1999 to 2009 the all-cause death rate in CHSDA counties for AI/AN persons was 46% more than that for Whites. Death rates for AI/AN persons varied as much as 50% among regions. Except for heart disease and cancer, subsequent ranking of specific causes of death differed considerably between AI/AN and White persons.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nAI/AN populations continue to experience much higher death rates than Whites. Patterns of mortality are strongly influenced by the high incidence of diabetes, smoking prevalence, problem drinking, and social determinants. Much of the observed excess mortality can be addressed through known public health interventions.",

    "abstract": "As artificial intelligence (AI) systems become increasingly ubiquitous, the topic of AI governance for ethical decision-making by AI has captured public imagination. Within the AI research community, this topic remains less familiar to many researchers. In this paper, we complement existing surveys, which largely focused on the psychological, social and legal discussions of the topic, with an analysis of recent advances in technical solutions for AI governance. By reviewing publications in leading AI conferences including AAAI, AAMAS, ECAI and IJCAI, we propose a taxonomy which divides the field into four areas: 1) exploring ethical dilemmas; 2) individual ethical decision frameworks; 3) collective ethical decision frameworks; and 4) ethics in human-AI interactions. We highlight the intuitions and key techniques used in each approach, and discuss promising future research directions towards successful integration of ethical AI systems into human societies.",

    "title": "A general model for soil organic matter dynamics: sensitivity to litter chemistry, texture and management.",
    "abstract": "Different conceptual and simulation models of soil organic matter (SOM) have been developed during the last 20 yr. Jenkinson and Rayners (1977) developed the first widely used SOM model. This model divided soil C into active, slow and passive pools that have different turnover times (1 yr, 30 yr, and 1500 yr, respectively). This conceptual framework has been used in many of the recently developed SOM models (van Veen & Paul, 1981; Parton et aI., 1987; Jenkinson, 1990). van Veen and Paul (1981) improved on Jenkinson and Rayners (1977) model by including concepts of physical and chemical protection, and factors such as soil erosion and soil cultivation. Parton et al. (1987) added the impact of soil texture on SOM dynamics and developed generalized nutrient cycling submodels which simultaneously simulate soil C and inorganic and organic N, P and S dynamics (Parton et aI., 1988). Jenkinson's most recent model (Jenkinson, 1990) also includes soil physical protection by clay. Many of the concepts used in the different SOM models have been incorporated into the nutrient cycling models that are linked to crop plant production models [Erosion-Productivity Impact Calculator (EPIC), Williams et aI., 1985; Nitrogen-Tillage-Residue Management (NTRM), Shaffer, 1985; DeNitrification and DeComposition Model (DNDC), Li",

    "title": "From analytics to artificial intelligence",
    "abstract": "ABSTRACT Analytics have been employed by companies for several decades, but now many firms are interested in building their capabilities for artificial intelligence (AI). Many AI systems, however, are based on statistics and other forms of analytics. Companies can get a “running start” on AI by building upon their analytical competencies. The focus of this article is how to transition from analytics to AI. Three eras of analytical focus are detailed, with AI portrayed as a fourth era. The types of AI methods that are and are not based on analytics are described. AI applications that build on analytical strengths are discussed. Approaches to assessing analytical capabilities that relate to AI, and the development of an organizational plan and strategy for AI, are also described in brief.",

    "abstract": "Until recently, bacteria were considered to live rather asocial, reclusive lives. New research shows that, in fact, bacteria have elaborate chemical signaling systems that enable them to communicate within and between species. One signal, termed AI-2, appears to be universal and facilitates interspecies communication. Many processes, including virulence factor production, biofilm formation, and motility, are controlled by AI-2. Strategies that interfere with communication in bacteria are being explored in the biotechnology industry with the aim of developing novel antimicrobials. AI-2 is a particularly attractive candidate for such studies because of its widespread use in the microbial kingdom.",

However, in the last 5 years, remarkable progress has been made using multilayered neural networks in diverse areas such as image recognition, speech recognition, and machine translation. AI is a general purpose technology that is likely to impact many industries. In this chapter I consider how machine learning availability might affect the industrial organization of both firms that provide AI services and industries that adopt AI technology.

    "title": "Reproductive management of lactating dairy cows using synchronization of ovulation.",
    "abstract": "Lactating dairy cows have poor reproductive efficiency because of low fertility and low rates of estrus detection. To eliminate the dependence on detection of estrus, we have recently developed a timed artificial insemination (AI) protocol that synchronized the time of ovulation using GnRH and PGF2 alpha. The effectiveness of this protocol as a management tool was compared with standard reproductive management. Lactating dairy cows (n = 333) from three herds were randomly assigned at parturition to two groups. Control cows were managed according to the typical reproductive strategy of the farm that relied on detection of estrus, the a.m.-p.m. breeding rule, and periodic use of PGF2 alpha. Treated cows had timed AI after synchronization of ovulation with GnRH and PGF2 alpha. For both groups, the voluntary waiting period was 50 d postpartum. Pregnancy diagnosis was performed by ultrasound between 32 and 38 d post-AI. Nonpregnant cows were inseminated again using the original treatment until diagnosed as pregnant or until culled from the herd. Median days to first AI (54 vs. 83) and days open (99 vs. 118) were lower for treated cows than for control cows, respectively. Pregnancy rates for the first AI were similar (37% vs. 39%) for the two groups even though treated cows were bred at an earlier time postpartum. More treated cows than control cows were pregnant at 60 d (37% vs. 5%) and at 100 d (53% vs. 35%) after calving. Thus, this protocol allowed effective management of AI in lactating dairy cows without the need for estrus detection.",

    "title": "Artificial Intelligence: A European Perspective",
    "abstract": "We are only at the beginning of a rapid period of transformation of our economy and society due to the convergence of many digital technologies. Artificial Intelligence (AI) is central to this change and offers major opportunities to improve our lives. The recent developments in AI are the result of increased processing power, improvements in algorithms and the exponential growth in the volume and variety of digital data. Many applications of AI have started entering into our every-day lives, from machine translations, to image recognition, and music generation, and are increasingly deployed in industry, government, and commerce. Connected and autonomous vehicles, and AI-supported medical diagnostics are areas of application that will soon be commonplace. There is strong global competition on AI among the US, China, and Europe. The US leads for now but China is catching up fast and aims to lead by 2030. For the EU, it is not so much a question of winning or losing a race but of finding the way of embracing the opportunities offered by AI in a way that is human-centred, ethical, secure, and true to our core values. The EU Member States and the European Commission are developing coordinated national and European strategies, recognising that only together we can succeed. We can build on our areas of strength including excellent research, leadership in some industrial sectors like automotive and robotics, a solid legal and regulatory framework, and very rich cultural diversity also at regional and sub-regional levels. It is generally recognised that AI can flourish only if supported by a robust computing infrastructure and good quality data: â€¢ With respect to computing, we identified a window of opportunity for Europe to invest in the emerging new paradigm of computing distributed towards the edges of the network, in addition to centralised facilities. This will support also the future deployment of 5G and the Internet of Things. â€¢ With respect to data, we argue in favour of learning from successful Internet companies, opening access to data and developing interactivity with the users rather than just broadcasting data. In this way, we can develop ecosystems of public administrations, firms, and civil society enriching the data to make it fit for AI applications responding to European needs. We should embrace the opportunities afforded by AI but not uncritically. The black box characteristics of most leading AI techniques make them opaque even to specialists. AI systems are currently limited to narrow and well-defined tasks, and their technologies inherit imperfections from their human creators, such as the well-recognised bias effect present in data. We should challenge the shortcomings of AI and work towards strong evaluation strategies, transparent and reliable systems, and good human-AI interactions. Ethical and secure-by-design algorithms are crucial to build trust in this disruptive technology, but we also need a broader engagement of civil society on the values to be embedded in AI and the directions for future development. This social engagement should be part of the effort to strengthen our resilience at all levels from local, to national and European, across institutions, industry and civil society. Developing local ecosystems of skills, computing, data, and applications can foster the engagement of local communities, respond to their needs, harness local creativity and knowledge, and build a human-centred, diverse, and socially driven AI. We still know very little about how AI will impact the way we think, make decisions, relate to each other, and how it will affect our jobs. This uncertainty can be a source of concern but is also a sign of opportunity. The future is not yet written. We can shape it based on our collective vision of what future we would like to have. But we need to act together and act fast.",

    "abstract": "The research community has considered in the past the application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques to control and operate networks. A notable example is the Knowledge Plane proposed by D.Clark et al. However, such techniques have not been extensively prototyped or deployed in the field yet. In this paper, we explore the reasons for the lack of adoption and posit that the rise of two recent paradigms: Software-Defined Networking (SDN) and Network Analytics (NA), will facilitate the adoption of AI techniques in the context of network operation and control. We describe a new paradigm that accommodates and exploits SDN, NA and AI, and provide use-cases that illustrate its applicability and benefits. We also present simple experimental results that support, for some relevant use-cases, its feasibility. We refer to this new paradigm as Knowledge-Defined Networking (KDN).",

    "title": "Artificial Intelligence & Human Rights: Opportunities & Risks",
    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (“AI”) is changing the world before our eyes. The promise of AI to improve our lives is enormous. AI-based systems are already outperforming medical specialists in diagnosing certain diseases, while the use of AI in the financial system is expanding access to credit to borrowers that were once passed by. Yet AI also has downsides that dampen its considerable promise. AI-based systems impact the right to privacy since they depend on the collection and use of vast quantities of data to make predictions which, in numerous cases, have served to perpetuate existing social patterns of bias and discrimination. \nThese disturbing possibilities have given rise to a movement seeking to embed ethical considerations into the development and deployment of AI. This project, on the other hand, demonstrates the considerable value in using human rights law to evaluate and address the complex impacts of AI on society. Human rights law provides an agreed set of norms and a shared language and institutional infrastructure for helping to ensure that the promises of AI are met and its greatest perils are avoided. \nOur project seeks to advance the emerging conversation on AI and human rights by evaluating the human rights impacts of six current uses of AI. Our framework recognizes that AI systems are not being deployed against a blank slate, but rather against the backdrop of social conditions that have complex pre-existing human rights impacts of their own. \nBy digging deep into current AI implementations, we see how they impact the full range of human rights guaranteed by international law, privacy chief among them. We also gain insight into the unequal distribution of the positive and negative impacts of AI on human rights throughout society, and begin to explore the power of the human rights framework to address these disparate impacts.",

    "abstract": "This paper aims to estimate ratio of area equipped for irrigation to cultivated area (AI) in Africa in 2035 and 2060 using studies of agricultural water management from 1962 to 2011. For this purpose, all necessary information was gathered from Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) and their values were checked using The World Bank Group (WBG). Among all presented data in the FAO database, 10 indices were selected (due to more importance and more availability for all the regions in Africa). The selected indices were analysed for all seven regions in the study area and the amount of AI was estimated by three different scenarios and using other nine indices. The results show that changes of AI are 0.3% to 49.5% and 16.5% to 83.2% from 2011 to 2035 and 2060, respectively. Indian Ocean Islands has a better potential to increase AI in the future. A considerable note is the change of irrigation status in the future than the current status. In 2011, AI of Sudano-Sahelian is more than AI of Indian Ocean Islands, however, in the future; AI of Sudano-Sahelian would be less than AI of Indian Ocean Islands based on all scenarios.",

    "abstract": "The increasing application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in health and medicine has attracted a great deal of research interest in recent decades. This study aims to provide a global and historical picture of research concerning AI in health and medicine. A total of 27,451 papers that were published between 1977 and 2018 (84.6% were dated 2008–2018) were retrieved from the Web of Science platform. The descriptive analysis examined the publication volume, and authors and countries collaboration. A global network of authors’ keywords and content analysis of related scientific literature highlighted major techniques, including Robotic, Machine learning, Artificial neural network, Artificial intelligence, Natural language process, and their most frequent applications in Clinical Prediction and Treatment. The number of cancer-related publications was the highest, followed by Heart Diseases and Stroke, Vision impairment, Alzheimer’s, and Depression. Moreover, the shortage in the research of AI application to some high burden diseases suggests future directions in AI research. This study offers a first and comprehensive picture of the global efforts directed towards this increasingly important and prolific field of research and suggests the development of global and national protocols and regulations on the justification and adaptation of medical AI products.",

    "abstract": "There is a wide range of interdisciplinary intersections between cyber security and artificial intelligence (AI). On one hand, AI technologies, such as deep learning, can be introduced into cyber security to construct smart models for implementing malware classification and intrusion detection and threating intelligence sensing. On the other hand, AI models will face various cyber threats, which will disturb their sample, learning, and decisions. Thus, AI models need specific cyber security defense and protection technologies to combat adversarial machine learning, preserve privacy in machine learning, secure federated learning, etc. Based on the above two aspects, we review the intersection of AI and cyber security. First, we summarize existing research efforts in terms of combating cyber attacks using AI, including adopting traditional machine learning methods and existing deep learning solutions. Then, we analyze the counterattacks from which AI itself may suffer, dissect their characteristics, and classify the corresponding defense methods. Finally, from the aspects of constructing encrypted neural network and realizing a secure federated deep learning, we expatiate the existing research on how to build a secure AI system.",

    "abstract": "Purpose\nTo evaluate the use of artificial intelligence (AI) to shorten digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) reading time while maintaining or improving accuracy.\n\n\nMaterials and Methods\nA deep learning AI system was developed to identify suspicious soft-tissue and calcified lesions in DBT images. A reader study compared the performance of 24 radiologists (13 of whom were breast subspecialists) reading 260 DBT examinations (including 65 cancer cases) both with and without AI. Readings occurred in two sessions separated by at least 4 weeks. Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), reading time, sensitivity, specificity, and recall rate were evaluated with statistical methods for multireader, multicase studies.\n\n\nResults\nRadiologist performance for the detection of malignant lesions, measured by mean AUC, increased 0.057 with the use of AI (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.028, 0.087; P < .01), from 0.795 without AI to 0.852 with AI. Reading time decreased 52.7% (95% CI: 41.8%, 61.5%; P < .01), from 64.1 seconds without to 30.4 seconds with AI. Sensitivity increased from 77.0% without AI to 85.0% with AI (8.0%; 95% CI: 2.6%, 13.4%; P < .01), specificity increased from 62.7% without to 69.6% with AI (6.9%; 95% CI: 3.0%, 10.8%; noninferiority P < .01), and recall rate for noncancers decreased from 38.0% without to 30.9% with AI (7.2%; 95% CI: 3.1%, 11.2%; noninferiority P < .01).\n\n\nConclusion\nThe concurrent use of an accurate DBT AI system was found to improve cancer detection efficacy in a reader study that demonstrated increases in AUC, sensitivity, and specificity and a reduction in recall rate and reading time.© RSNA, 2019See also the commentary by Hsu and Hoyt in this issue.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVES\nTo investigate the current clinical applications and diagnostic performance of artificial intelligence (AI) in dental and maxillofacial radiology (DMFR).\n\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nStudies using applications related to DMFR to develop or implement AI models were sought by searching five electronic databases and four selected core journals in the field of DMFR. The customized assessment criteria based on QUADAS-2 were adapted for quality analysis of the studies included.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe initial electronic search yielded 1862 titles, and 50 studies were eventually included. Most studies focused on AI applications for an automated localization of cephalometric landmarks, diagnosis of osteoporosis, classification/segmentation of maxillofacial cysts and/or tumors, and identification of periodontitis/periapical disease. The performance of AI models varies among different algorithms.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThe AI models proposed in the studies included exhibited wide clinical applications in DMFR. Nevertheless, it is still necessary to further verify the reliability and applicability of the AI models prior to transferring these models into clinical practice.",

There are three forms: combinational, exploratory, and transformational. All three can be modeled by AI—in some cases, with impressive results. AI techniques underlie various types of computer art. Whether computers could “really” be creative isn’t a scientific question but a philosophical one, to which there’s no clear answer. But we do have the beginnings of a scientific understanding of creativity.",

    "title": "Pregnancy rates per artificial insemination for cows and heifers inseminated at a synchronized ovulation or synchronized estrus.",
    "abstract": "Two synchronization protocols were tested for lactating dairy cows and heifers. Nulliparous dairy heifers (13 to 23 mo; n = 155) and primiparous and multiparous dairy cows (60 to 289 d postpartum; n = 310) were assigned randomly to two treatments. Controls received 25 mg of PGF2 alpha and were artificially inseminated according to the a.m.-p.m. rule following detected estrus. All controls that were not detected in estrus were injected with 25 mg of PGF2 alpha at 14-d intervals until artificial insemination (AI) at a detected estrus or until timed AI at 72 to 80 h after a third sequential injection of PGF2 alpha. Treated cows and heifers received a protocol that used GnRH and PGF2 alpha to synchronize ovulation (Ovsynch). Cows and heifers that were treated with Ovsynch were injected i.m. with 100 micrograms of GnRH at a random stage of the estrous cycle. Seven days later, cows and heifers in this group received 25 mg of PGF2 alpha followed by a second injection of 100 micrograms of GnRH 30 to 36 h later. Subsequently, the treated cows and heifers received AI 16 to 20 h after the second injection of GnRH. Pregnancy rates per AI were similar (38.9% vs. 37.8%) for control cows and cows treated with the Ovsynch protocol, respectively. However, pregnancy rate per AI was greater for control heifers (74.4%) than for heifers treated with Ovsynch (35.1%). Evaluation of serum progesterone concentrations at each hormonal injection indicated that the first injection of GnRH synchronized luteal function of lactating dairy cows but not of heifers. In summary, one fixed-time AI at a synchronized ovulation provided similar pregnancy rates per AI as did AI following the a.m-p.m. rule after estrus had been induced by PGF2 alpha in lactating cows, but the fixed-time AI was not effective for heifers because of the lack of synchronization.",

    "abstract": "From the Publisher: \nIn his groundbreaking new book, John Pollock establishes an outpost at the crossroads where artificial intelligence meets philosophy. Specifically, he proposes a general theory of rationality and then describes its implementation in OSCAR, an architecture for an autonomous rational agent he claims is the \"first AI system capable of performing reasoning that philosophers would regard as epistemically sophisticated.\" \nA sequel to Pollock's How to Build a Person, this volume builds upon that theoretical groundwork for the implementation of rationality through artificial intelligence. Pollock argues that progress in AI has stalled because of its creators' reliance upon unformulated intuitions about rationality. Instead, he bases the OSCAR architecture upon an explicit philosophical theory of rationality, encompassing principles of practical cognition, epistemic cognition, and defeasible reasoning. One of the results is the world's first automated defeasible reasoner capable of reasoning in a rich, logical environment. \nUnderlying Pollock's thesis is a conviction that the tenets of artifical intelligence and those of philosophy can be complementary and mutually beneficial. And, while members of both camps have in recent years grown skeptical of the very possibility of \"symbol processing\" AI, Cognitive Carpentry establishes that such an approach to AI can be successful. \nA Bradford Book",

    "abstract": "Much has been written recently about artificial intelligence (AI) and law. But what is AI, and what is its relation to the practice and administration of law? This article addresses those questions by providing a high-level overview of AI and its use within law. The discussion aims to be nuanced but also understandable to those without a technical background. To that end, I first discuss AI generally. I then turn to AI and how it is being used by lawyers in the practice of law, people and companies who are governed by the law, and government officials who administer the law. A key motivation in writing this article is to provide a realistic, demystified view of AI that is rooted in the actual capabilities of the technology. This is meant to contrast with discussions about AI and law that are decidedly futurist in nature. That body of work speculates about the effects of AI developments that do not currently exist and which may, or may not, ever come about. Although those futurist conversations have their place, it is important to acknowledge that they involve significant, sometimes unsupported, assumptions about where the technology is headed. That speculative discussion often distracts from the important, but perhaps less exotic, law and policy issues actually raised by AI technology today.",

    "title": "Modeling Adaptive Autonomous Agents",
    "abstract": "One category of research in Artificial Life is concerned with modeling and building so-called adaptive autonomous agents, which are systems that inhabit a dynamic, unpredictable environment in which they try to satisfy a set of time-dependent goals or motivations. Agents are said to be adaptive if they improve their competence at dealing with these goals based on experience. Autonomous agents constitute a new approach to the study of Artificial Intelligence (AI), which is highly inspired by biology, in particular ethology, the study of animal behavior. Research in autonomous agents has brought about a new wave of excitement into the field of AI. This paper reflects on the state of the art of this new approach. It attempts to extract its main ideas, evaluates what contributions have been made so far, and identifies its current limitations and open problems.",

    "title": "Predictors of aromatase inhibitor discontinuation as a result of treatment-emergent symptoms in early-stage breast cancer.",
    "abstract": "PURPOSE\nAromatase inhibitors (AIs) are effective for treatment of hormone receptor-positive breast cancer, but adherence and persistence with therapy are poor. Predictors of treatment discontinuation are not clearly defined. It is unknown whether patients with intolerable toxicity from one AI are able to tolerate another.\n\n\nPATIENTS AND METHODS\nWomen with early-stage breast cancer initiating AI therapy were enrolled onto a multicenter, prospective, open-label randomized trial of exemestane versus letrozole. Patients completed symptom questionnaires at baseline and serially during therapy. Patients who developed AI-associated intolerable symptoms and discontinued treatment were given the option to switch to the other study AI after a 2- to 8-week washout period.\n\n\nRESULTS\nOf the 503 enrolled women, 32.4% discontinued initial AI therapy within 2 years because of adverse effects; 24.3% discontinued specifically because of musculoskeletal symptoms. Median time to treatment discontinuation as a result of any symptom was 6.1 months (range, 0.1 to 21.2 months) and was significantly shorter in patients randomly assigned to exemestane (hazard ratio [HR], 1.5; 95% CI, 1.1 to 2.1; P = .02). Younger age and taxane-based chemotherapy were associated with higher likelihood of treatment discontinuation (HR, 1.4; 95% CI, 1.02 to 1.9; P = .04; and HR, 1.9; 95% CI, 1.00 to 3.6; P = .048, respectively). Of the 83 patients who chose to switch to the second AI, 38.6% continued the alternate AI for a median of 13.7 months.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nPremature discontinuation of initial AI therapy as a result of symptoms is common, although more than one third of patients may be able to tolerate a different AI medication. Additional research is needed to identify predictive tools and interventions for AI-associated treatment-emergent symptoms.",

    "title": "Exploring Opportunities and Challenges of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning in Higher Education Institutions",
    "abstract": "The way people travel, organise their time, and acquire information has changed due to information technologies. Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are mechanisms that evolved from data management and developing processes. Incorporating these mechanisms into business is a trend many different industries, including education, have identified as game-changers. As a result, education platforms and applications are more closely aligned with learners’ needs and knowledge, making the educational process more efficient. Therefore, AI and ML have great potential in e-learning and higher education institutions (HEI). Thus, the article aims to determine its potential and use areas in higher education based on secondary research and document analysis (literature review), content analysis, and primary research (survey). As referent points for this research, multiple academic, scientific, and commercial sources were used to obtain a broader picture of the research subject. Furthermore, the survey was implemented among students in the Republic of Serbia, with 103 respondents to generate data and information on how much knowledge of AI and ML is held by the student population, mainly to understand both opportunities and challenges involved in AI and ML in HEI. The study addresses critical issues, like common knowledge and stance of research bases regarding AI and ML in HEI; best practices regarding usage of AI and ML in HEI; students’ knowledge of AI and ML; and students’ attitudes regarding AI and ML opportunities and challenges in HEI. In statistical considerations, aiming to evaluate if the indicators were considered reflexive and, in this case, belong to the same theoretical dimension, the Correlation Matrix was presented, followed by the Composite Reliability. Finally, the results were evaluated by regression analysis. The results indicated that AI and ML are essential technologies that enhance learning, primarily through students’ skills, collaborative learning in HEI, and an accessible research environment.",

It presents AI as the study of the design of intelligent computational agents. The book is structured as a textbook, but it is accessible to a wide audience of professionals and researchers. The past decades have witnessed the emergence of AI as a serious science and engineering discipline. This book provides the first accessible synthesis of the field aimed at undergraduate and graduate students. It provides a coherent vision of the foundations of the field as it is today, in terms of a multidimensional design space that has been partially explored. As with any science worth its salt, AI has a coherent, formal theory and a rambunctious experimental wing. The book balances theory and experiment, showing how to link them intimately together. It develops the science of AI together with its engineering applications.",

    "title": "History and application of artificial neural networks in dentistry",
    "abstract": "ABSTRACT Artificial intelligence (AI) is a commonly used term in daily life, and there are now two subconcepts that divide the entire range of meanings currently encompassed by the term. The coexistence of the concepts of strong and weak AI can be seen as a result of the recognition of the limits of mathematical and engineering concepts that have dominated the definition. This presentation reviewed the concept, history, and the current application of AI in daily life. Applications of AI are becoming a reality that is commonplace in all areas of modern human life. Efforts to develop robots controlled by AI have been continuously carried out to maximize human convenience. AI has also been applied in the medical decision-making process, and these AI systems can help nonspecialists to obtain expert-level information. Artificial neural networks are highly interconnected networks of computer processors inspired by biological nervous systems. These systems may help connect dental professionals all over the world. Currently, the use of AI is rapidly advancing beyond text-based, image-based dental practice. This presentation reviewed the history of artificial neural networks in the medical and dental fields, as well as current application in dentistry. As the use of AI in the entire medical field increases, the role of AI in dentistry will be greatly expanded. Currently, the use of AI is rapidly advancing beyond text-based, image-based dental practice. In addition to diagnosis of visually confirmed dental caries and impacted teeth, studies applying machine learning based on artificial neural networks to dental treatment through analysis of dental magnetic resonance imaging, computed tomography, and cephalometric radiography are actively underway, and some visible results are emerging at a rapid pace for commercialization.",

    "title": "Application of Arti ﬁ cial Intelligence in COVID-19 drug repurposing",
    "abstract": "Background and aim: COVID-19 outbreak has created havoc and a quick cure for the disease will be a therapeutic medicine that has usage history in patients to resolve the current pandemic. With technological advancements in Arti ﬁ cial Intelligence (AI) coupled with increased computational power, the AI-empowered drug repurposing can prove bene ﬁ cial in the COVID-19 scenario. Methods: The recent literature is studied and analyzed from various sources such as Scopus, Google Scholar, PubMed, and IEEE Xplore databases. The search terms used are ‘ COVID-19 0 , ’ AI 0 , and ‘ Drug Repurposing ’ . Results: AI is implemented in the ﬁ eld design through the generation of the learning-prediction model and performs a quick virtual screening to accurately display the output. With a drug-repositioning strategy, AI can quickly detect drugs that can ﬁ ght against emerging diseases such as COVID-19. This technology has the potential to improve the drug discovery, planning, treatment, and reported outcomes of the COVID-19 patient, being an evidence-based medical tool. Conclusions: Thus, there are chances that the application of the AI approach in drug discovery is feasible. With prior usage experiences in patients, few of the old drugs, if shown active against SARS-CoV-2, can be readily applied to treat the COVID-19 patients. With the collaboration of AI with pharmacology, the ef ﬁ ciency of drug repurposing can improve signi ﬁ cantly. © 2020 Diabetes India. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

    "title": "Steps Toward Robust Artificial Intelligence",
    "abstract": "Recent advances in artificial intelligence are encouraging governments and corporations to deploy AI in high-stakes settings including driving cars autonomously, managing the power grid, trading on stock exchanges, and controlling autonomous weapons systems. Such applications require AI methods to be robust to both the known unknowns (those uncertain aspects of the world about which the computer can reason explicitly) and the unknown unknowns (those aspects of the world that are not captured by the system’s models). This article discusses recent progress in AI and then describes eight ideas related to robustness that are being pursued within the AI research community. While these ideas are a start, we need to devote more attention to the challenges of dealing with the known and unknown unknowns. These issues are fascinating, because they touch on the fundamental question of how finite systems can survive and thrive in a complex and dangerous world",

    "abstract": "In recent years, artificial intelligence (AI) has become an emerging trend in different fields: science, business, medicine, automotive and education. AI has also reached marketing. The aim of the paper is to research how deeply AI is applied in marketing and what implications there are for marketing practitioners. Authors stated two research questions - which areas of AI are used in marketing and what implications AI delivers for marketing managers. To answer those questions, the authors conducted research on secondary data with AI examples used for marketing purpose. The analysis of gathered examples shows that AI is widely introduced into the marketing field, though the applications are at the operational level. This may be the effect of careful implementation of the new technology, still at the level of experimenting with it. The uncertainty of the outcome of AI implementation may affect the caution in putting these innovations into practice as well. Gathered examples proved that AI influences all aspects of marketing mix impacting both consumer value delivery as well as the marketing organization and management. The paper delivers implications for business, especially ideas about implementing AI into marketing, designing innovations and the ideas on how to incorporate new skills into marketing team required by the new technology.",

    "title": "At the heart of the ventral attention system: The right anterior insula",
    "abstract": "The anterior insula has been hypothesized to provide a link between attention‐related problem solving and salience systems during the coordination and evaluation of task performance. Here, we test the hypothesis that the anterior insula/medial frontal operculum (aI/fO) provides linkage across systems supporting task demands and attention systems by examining the patterns of functional connectivity during word recognition and spatial attention functional imaging tasks. A shared set of frontal regions (right aI/fO, right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, bilateral anterior cingulate) were engaged, regardless of perceptual domain (auditory or visual) or mode of response (word production or button press). We present novel evidence that: (1) the right aI/fO is functionally connected with other frontal regions implicated in executive function and not just brain regions responsive to stimulus salience; and (2) that the aI/fO, but not the ACC, exhibits significantly correlated activity with other brain regions specifically engaged by tasks with varying perceptual and behavioral demands. These results support the hypothesis that the right aI/fO aids in the coordination and evaluation of task performance across behavioral tasks with varying perceptual and response demands.

    "abstract": "This paper attempts to give a high-level overview of the field of artificial and computational intelligence (AI/CI) in games, with particular reference to how the different core research areas within this field inform and interact with each other, both actually and potentially. We identify ten main research areas within this field: NPC behavior learning, search and planning, player modeling, games as AI benchmarks, procedural content generation, computational narrative, believable agents, AI-assisted game design, general game artificial intelligence and AI in commercial games. We view and analyze the areas from three key perspectives: 1) the dominant AI method(s) used under each area; 2) the relation of each area with respect to the end (human) user; and 3) the placement of each area within a human-computer (player-game) interaction perspective. In addition, for each of these areas we consider how it could inform or interact with each of the other areas; in those cases where we find that meaningful interaction either exists or is possible, we describe the character of that interaction and provide references to published studies, if any. We believe that this paper improves understanding of the current nature of the game AI/CI research field and the interdependences between its core areas by providing a unifying overview. We also believe that the discussion of potential interactions between research areas provides a pointer to many interesting future research projects and unexplored subfields.",

    "abstract": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) transforms businesses and organizes innovation activities. AI could compel companies to restructure the whole innovation process in response to rapid technological advancement and the rearrangement of human resources. Society at large sees artificial intelligence (AI) as a representation of unlimited possibilities. AI will contribute to fresh, more efficient market models and efficient, public sector and user-centered services. The objective of this research was to explore the impacts of AI in innovation and its outlook in the U.S and the economy. According to a worldwide survey of 203 managers, health and life sciences, manufacturing, retailers, and financial institutions are involved in testing water, especially in The United States. Among these entities, about one-third of businesses are exploring AI technology and its implementations, while another third is experimenting and a tenth of them are using AI in small fields. They are now in the exploratory stage.AI has also been deployed extensively by a handful of the companies (2.5%). This paper will illustrate how AI can fix problems and what it is necessary to consider when transforming innovation into a global economy. Finally, the paper will explore insights into the potential of AI in the U.S.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE\nAromatase inhibitors (AIs) improve survival in postmenopausal women with hormone-sensitive breast cancer, but can cause joint pain and stiffness. The purpose of the current study was to evaluate the prevalence of and identify risk factors for AI-related joint symptoms.\n\n\nPATIENTS AND METHODS\nWe performed a cross-sectional survey of consecutive postmenopausal women receiving adjuvant AI therapy for early-stage hormone-sensitive breast cancer at an urban academic breast oncology clinic. Patients completed a 25-item self-administered questionnaire assessing the presence of joint symptoms that started or worsened after initiating AIs. Multivariate regression was used to compare those with AI-related arthralgia with those who did not report symptoms, adjusting for demographic and clinical factors.\n\n\nRESULTS\nOf 200 patients who completed the survey, 94 (47%) reported having AI-related joint pain and 88 (44%) reported AI-related joint stiffness. In multiple logistic regression analysis, being overweight (body mass index of 25 to 30 kg/m(2)) and prior tamoxifen therapy were inversely associated with AI-related joint symptoms. Patients who received taxane chemotherapy were more than four times more likely than other patients to have AI-related joint pain and stiffness (odds ratio [OR] = 4.08, 95% CI, 1.58 to 10.57 and OR = 4.76; 95% CI, 1.84 to 12.28, respectively).\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nOur study suggests that AI-related joint symptoms are more prevalent than what has been described previously in clinical trials. The success of AI therapy depends on patients' ability to adhere to treatment recommendations; therefore, additional studies of interventions that may alleviate these symptoms are needed.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to significantly transform the role of the doctor and revolutionise the practice of medicine. This qualitative review paper summarises the past 12 months of health research in AI, across different medical specialties, and discusses the current strengths as well as challenges, relating to this emerging technology. Doctors, especially those in leadership roles, need to be aware of how quickly AI is advancing in health, so that they are ready to lead the change required for its adoption by the health system. Key points: ‘AI has now been shown to be as effective as humans in the diagnosis of various medical conditions, and in some cases, more effective.’ When it comes to predicting suicide attempts, recent research suggest AI is better than human beings. ‘AI’s current strength is in its ability to learn from a large dataset and recognise patterns that can be used to diagnose conditions, putting it in direct competition with medical specialties that are involved in diagnostic tests that involve pattern recognition, such as pathology and radiology’. The current challenges in AI include legal liability and attribution of negligence when errors occur, and the ethical issues relating to patient choices. ‘AI systems can also be developed with, or learn, biases, that will need to be identified and mitigated’. As doctors and health leaders, we need to start preparing the profession to be supported by, partnered with, and, in future, potentially be replaced by, AI and advanced robotics systems.",

    "abstract": "In the era of personalized medicine, the emphasis of health care is shifting from populations to individuals. Artificial intelligence (AI) is capable of learning without explicit instruction and has emerging applications in radiology. Whereas much attention has focused on teaching radiology trainees about AI, here our goal is to instead focus on how AI might be developed to better teach radiology trainees. While the idea of using AI to improve education is not new, the application of AI to medical and radiological education remains very limited. Based on the current educational foundation, we highlight an AI-integrated framework to augment radiology education and provide use case examples informed by our own institution's practice. The coming age of 'AI-augmented radiology' may enable not only \"precision medicine\" but also \"precision education,\" where instruction is tailored to individual trainees based on their learning styles and needs.",

    "abstract": "Given the ubiquity of artificial intelligence (AI) in modern societies, it is clear that individuals, corporations, and countries will be grappling with the legal and ethical issues of its use. As global problems require global solutions, we propose the establishment of an international AI regulatory agency that --- drawing on interdisciplinary expertise --- could create a unified framework for the regulation of AI technologies and inform the development of AI policies around the world. We urge that such an organization be developed with all deliberate haste, as issues such as cryptocurrencies, personalized political ad hacking, autonomous vehicles and autonomous weaponized agents are already a reality, affecting international trade, politics, and war.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) was introduced to develop and create “thinking machines” that are capable of mimicking, learning, and replacing human intelligence. Since the late 1970s, AI has shown great promise in improving human decision-making processes and the subsequent productivity in various business endeavors due to its ability to recognise business patterns, learn business phenomena, seek information, and analyse data intelligently. Despite its widespread acceptance as a decision-aid tool, AI has seen limited application in supply chain management (SCM). To fully exploit the potential benefits of AI for SCM, this paper explores various sub-fields of AI that are most suitable for solving practical problems relevant to SCM. In so doing, this paper reviews the past record of success in AI applications to SCM and identifies the most fruitful areas of SCM in which to apply AI.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE\nTo develop evidence-based guidelines, based on a systematic review, for endocrine therapy for postmenopausal women with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer.\n\n\nMETHODS\nA literature search identified relevant randomized trials. Databases searched included MEDLINE, PREMEDLINE, the Cochrane Collaboration Library, and those for the Annual Meetings of the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) and the San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium (SABCS). The primary outcomes of interest were disease-free survival, overall survival, and time to contralateral breast cancer. Secondary outcomes included adverse events and quality of life. An expert panel reviewed the literature, especially 12 major trials, and developed updated recommendations.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAn adjuvant treatment strategy incorporating an aromatase inhibitor (AI) as primary (initial endocrine therapy), sequential (using both tamoxifen and an AI in either order), or extended (AI after 5 years of tamoxifen) therapy reduces the risk of breast cancer recurrence compared with 5 years of tamoxifen alone. Data suggest that including an AI as primary monotherapy or as sequential treatment after 2 to 3 years of tamoxifen yields similar outcomes. Tamoxifen and AIs differ in their adverse effect profiles, and these differences may inform treatment preferences.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThe Update Committee recommends that postmenopausal women with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer consider incorporating AI therapy at some point during adjuvant treatment, either as up-front therapy or as sequential treatment after tamoxifen. The optimal timing and duration of endocrine treatment remain unresolved. The Update Committee supports careful consideration of adverse effect profiles and patient preferences in deciding whether and when to incorporate AI therapy.",

Acne inversa (AI), also known as hidradenitis suppurativa, is a chronic, recurrent, inflammatory disease of hair follicles that often runs in families. We studied six Chinese families with features of AI as well as additional skin lesions on back, face, nape, and waist and found independent loss-of-function mutations in PSENEN, PSEN1, or NCSTN, the genes encoding essential components of the γ-secretase multiprotein complex. Our results identify the γ-secretase component genes as the culprits for a subset of familial AI, implicate the γ-secretase–Notch pathway in the molecular pathogenesis of AI, and demonstrate that familial AI can be an allelic disorder of early-onset familial Alzheimer’s disease.",

    "title": "Autoimmune acute liver failure: Proposed clinical and histological criteria",
    "abstract": "Identifying autoimmune hepatitis as the etiology of acute liver failure (ALF) is potentially important, because administering corticosteroids might avoid the need for liver transplantation. However, clinical and histological criteria of autoimmune ALF (AI‐ALF) have not been defined. Liver sections (biopsies and explants) from a 72‐patient subset of the ALF Study Group Registry with indeterminate ALF were reviewed by a pathologist blinded to all clinical data and were diagnosed with probable AI‐ALF based on four features suggestive of an autoi mmune pathogenesis: distinctive patterns of massive hepatic necrosis (present in 42% of sections), presence of lymphoid follicles (32%), a plasma cell–enriched inflammatory infiltrate (63%), and central perivenulitis (65%). Forty‐two sections (58%) were considered probable for AI‐ALF; this group demonstrated higher serum globulins (3.7 ± 0.2 g/dL versus 3.0 ± 0.2 g/dL; P = 0.037) and a higher prevalence of antinuclear and/or anti–smooth muscle antibodies (73% versus 48%; P = 0.034) compared to those without histology suggestive of probable AI‐ALF. Thirty patients concordant for autoantibodies and probable AI‐ALF upon histological analysis were more likely to have the classical autoimmune hepatitis phenotype (female predominance [72% versus 48%; P < 0.05], higher globulins [3.9 ± 0.2 g/dL versus 3.0 ± 0.2 g/dL; P < 0.005], and higher incidence of chronic hepatitis in long‐term follow‐up [67% versus 17%, P = 0.019]) compared to the population without concordant AI‐ALF histology and autoantibodies. Conclusion: Patients with indeterminate ALF often have features of autoimmune disease by histological analysis, serological testing, and clinical recurrence during follow‐up. In contrast to classical autoimmune hepatitis, histological features of AI‐ALF predominate in the centrilobular zone. (HEPATOLOGY 2011;53:517‐526)",

    "title": "The Development of Aortic Insufficiency in Left Ventricular Assist Device-Supported Patients",
    "abstract": "Background—Aortic insufficiency (AI) following left ventricular assist device (LVAD) placement can affect device performance. The aim of this study was to examine AI development following LVAD implantation. Methods and Results—Echocardiograms (n=315) from 78 subjects undergoing HeartMate-XVE (n=25 [32%]) or HeartMate-II (n=53 [68%]) implantations from 2004 to 2008 were reviewed. Studies were obtained preoperatively and at 1, 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months after surgery. AI was graded on an interval scale (0=none, 0.5=trivial, 1=mild, 1.5=mild-moderate, 2=moderate, 2.5=moderate-severe, 3=severe), and the change in AI at follow-up was analyzed with significance tests. Kaplan–Meier estimates for freedom from moderate or worse AI at follow-up were generated. Mixed-model linear regression was used to identify correlates of AI progression during LVAD support. The median (25th, 75th percentile) duration of LVAD support was 239 (112, 455) days, and preoperative AI grade was 0.0 (0.0, 0.0). At 6 months, 89±4% of subjects (n=49 at risk) were free from moderate or worse AI, but this was reduced to 74±7% (n=29 at risk) and 49±13% (n=13 at risk) by 12 and 18 months, respectively. Correlates (slope±SE) of AI progression included female sex (0.002±0.001; P=0.01), smaller body surface area (−0.003±0.001 per m2; P=0.0017), and HeartMate-II model type (0.002±0.001; P=0.039). Correlates (&bgr;±SE) of progressive AI on postoperative echocardiogram included increasing aortic sinus diameter (0.04±0.01 per mm; P=0.001), an aortic valve that remained closed (0.42±0.06; P<0.001) or only intermittently opened (0.34±0.09; P<0.001), and lower left ventricular diastolic (−0.002±0.0004 per cm3; P<0.001) and systolic (−0.002±0.0004 per cm3; P<0.001) volumes. Conclusions—AI progresses over time in LVAD-supported patients. As we move toward an era of long-term cardiac support, more studies are needed to determine the clinical significance of these findings.",

    "title": "Artificial Intelligence: Foundations of Computational Agents",
    "abstract": "Recent decades have witnessed the emergence of artificial intelligence as a serious science and engineering discipline. Artificial Intelligence: Foundations of Computational Agents is a textbook aimed at junior to senior undergraduate students and first-year graduate students. It presents artificial intelligence (AI) using a coherent framework to study the design of intelligent computational agents. By showing how basic approaches fit into a multidimensional design space, readers can learn the fundamentals without losing sight of the bigger picture. The book balances theory and experiment, showing how to link them intimately together, and develops the science of AI together with its engineering applications. Although structured as a textbook, the book's straightforward, self-contained style will also appeal to a wide audience of professionals, researchers, and independent learners. AI is a rapidly developing field: this book encapsulates the latest results without being exhaustive and encyclopedic. It teaches the main principles and tools that will allow readers to explore and learn on their own. The text is supported by an online learning environment, AIspace, http://aispace.org, so that students can experiment with the main AI algorithms plus problems, animations, lecture slides, and a knowledge representation system, AIlog, for experimentation and problem solving.",

    "title": "Epidemiology of adrenal crisis in chronic adrenal insufficiency: the need for new prevention strategies.",
    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nAdrenal crisis (AC) is a life-threatening complication of adrenal insufficiency (AI). Here, we evaluated frequency, causes and risk factors of AC in patients with chronic AI.\n\n\nMETHODS\nIn a cross-sectional study, 883 patients with AI were contacted by mail. Five-hundred and twenty-six patients agreed to participate and received a disease-specific questionnaire.\n\n\nRESULTS\nFour-hundred and forty-four datasets were available for analysis (primary AI (PAI), n=254; secondary AI (SAI), n=190). Forty-two percent (PAI 47% and SAI 35%) reported at least one crisis. Three hundred and eighty-four AC in 6092 patient years were documented (frequency of 6.3 crises/100 patient years). Precipitating causes were mainly gastrointestinal infection and fever (45%) but also other stressful events (e.g. major pain, surgery, psychic distress, heat and pregnancy). Sudden onset of apparently unexplained AC was also reported (PAI 6.6% and SAI 12.7%). Patients with PAI reported more frequent emergency glucocorticoid administration (42.5 vs 28.4%, P=0.003). Crisis incidence was not influenced by educational status, body mass index, glucocorticoid dose, DHEA treatment, age at diagnosis, hypogonadism, hypothyroidism or GH deficiency. In PAI, patients with concomitant non-endocrine disease were at higher risk of crisis (odds ratio (OR)=2.02, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.05-3.89, P=0.036). In SAI, female sex (OR=2.18, 95% CI 1.06-4.5, P=0.035) and diabetes insipidus (OR=2.71, 95% CI 1.22-5.99, P=0.014) were associated with higher crisis incidence.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nAC occurs in a substantial proportion of patients with chronic AI, mainly triggered by infectious disease. Only a limited number of risk factors suitable for targeting prevention of AC were identified. These findings indicate the need for new concepts of crisis prevention in patients with AI.",

This book traces the history of the subject, from the early dreams of eighteenth-century (and earlier) pioneers to the more successful work of today's AI engineers. AI is becoming more and more a part of everyone's life. The technology is already embedded in face-recognizing cameras, speech-recognition software, Internet search engines, and health-care robots, among other applications. The book's many diagrams and easy-to-understand descriptions of AI programs will help the casual reader gain an understanding of how these and other AI systems actually work. Its thorough (but unobtrusive) end-of-chapter notes containing citations to important source materials will be of great use to AI scholars and researchers. This book promises to be the definitive history of a field that has captivated the imaginations of scientists, philosophers, and writers for centuries.",

    "abstract": "Although non-Hispanic American Indian and Alaska Native (AI/AN) persons account for 0.7% of the U.S. population,* a recent analysis reported that 1.3% of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases reported to CDC with known race and ethnicity were among AI/AN persons (1). To assess the impact of COVID-19 among the AI/AN population, reports of laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases during January 22†-July 3, 2020 were analyzed. The analysis was limited to 23 states§ with >70% complete race/ethnicity information and five or more laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases among both AI/AN persons (alone or in combination with other races and ethnicities) and non-Hispanic white (white) persons. Among 424,899 COVID-19 cases reported by these states, 340,059 (80%) had complete race/ethnicity information; among these 340,059 cases, 9,072 (2.7%) occurred among AI/AN persons, and 138,960 (40.9%) among white persons. Among 340,059 cases with complete patient race/ethnicity data, the cumulative incidence among AI/AN persons in these 23 states was 594 per 100,000 AI/AN population (95% confidence interval [CI] = 203-1,740), compared with 169 per 100,000 white population (95% CI = 137-209) (rate ratio [RR] = 3.5; 95% CI = 1.2-10.1). AI/AN persons with COVID-19 were younger (median age = 40 years; interquartile range [IQR] = 26-56 years) than were white persons (median age = 51 years; IQR = 32-67 years). More complete case report data and timely, culturally responsive, and evidence-based public health efforts that leverage the strengths of AI/AN communities are needed to decrease COVID-19 transmission and improve patient outcomes.",

    "title": "Ethical Considerations in Artificial Intelligence Courses",
    "abstract": "The recent surge in interest in ethics in artificial intelligence may leave many educators wondering how to address moral, ethical, and philosophical issues in their AI courses. As instructors we want to develop curriculum that not only prepares students to be artificial intelligence practitioners, but also to understand the moral, ethical, and philosophical impacts that artificial intelligence will have on society. In this article we provide practical case studies and links to resources for use by AI educators. We also provide concrete suggestions on how to integrate AI ethics into a general artificial intelligence course and how to teach a stand-alone artificial intelligence ethics course.",

    "title": "Integrating Artificial Intelligence and Nanotechnology for Precision Cancer Medicine",
    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) and nanotechnology are two fields that are instrumental in realizing the goal of precision medicine—tailoring the best treatment for each cancer patient. Recent conversion between these two fields is enabling better patient data acquisition and improved design of nanomaterials for precision cancer medicine. Diagnostic nanomaterials are used to assemble a patient‐specific disease profile, which is then leveraged, through a set of therapeutic nanotechnologies, to improve the treatment outcome. However, high intratumor and interpatient heterogeneities make the rational design of diagnostic and therapeutic platforms, and analysis of their output, extremely difficult. Integration of AI approaches can bridge this gap, using pattern analysis and classification algorithms for improved diagnostic and therapeutic accuracy. Nanomedicine design also benefits from the application of AI, by optimizing material properties according to predicted interactions with the target drug, biological fluids, immune system, vasculature, and cell membranes, all affecting therapeutic efficacy. Here, fundamental concepts in AI are described and the contributions and promise of nanotechnology coupled with AI to the future of precision cancer medicine are reviewed.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE\nTo conduct meta-analyses of randomized trials of aromatase inhibitors (AIs) compared with tamoxifen either as initial monotherapy (cohort 1) or after 2 to 3 years of tamoxifen (cohort 2).\n\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nData submitted to the Early Breast Cancer Trialists' Collaborative Group were used in separate meta-analyses of two cohorts. Primary analyses involve postmenopausal women with tumors reported to be estrogen receptor positive. Log-rank P values are two-sided.\n\n\nRESULTS\nCohort 1 comprised 9,856 patients with a mean of 5.8 years of follow-up. At 5 years, AI therapy was associated with an absolute 2.9% (SE = 0.7%) decrease in recurrence (9.6% for AI v 12.6% for tamoxifen; 2P < .00001) and a nonsignificant absolute 1.1% (SE = 0.5%) decrease in breast cancer mortality (4.8% for AI v 5.9% for tamoxifen; 2P = .1). Cohort 2 comprised 9,015 patients with a mean of 3.9 years of follow-up. At 3 years from treatment divergence (ie, approximately 5 years after starting hormonal treatment), AI therapy was associated with an absolute 3.1% (SE = 0.6%) decrease in recurrence (5.0% for AI v 8.1% for tamoxifen since divergence; 2P < .00001) and an absolute 0.7% (SE = 0.3%) decrease in breast cancer mortality (1.7% for AI v 2.4% for tamoxifen since divergence; 2P = .02). There was no convincing heterogeneity in the proportional recurrence reduction with respect to age, nodal status, tumor grade, or progesterone receptor status and no indication of an increase in nonbreast deaths with AIs in either cohort. CONCLUSION AIs produce significantly lower recurrence rates compared with tamoxifen, either as initial monotherapy or after 2 to 3 years of tamoxifen. Additional follow-up will provide clearer information on long-term survival.",

    "title": "Agricultural intensification and biodiversity partitioning in European landscapes comparing plants, carabids, and birds.",
    "abstract": "Effects of agricultural intensification (AI) on biodiversity are often assessed on the plot scale, although processes determining diversity also operate on larger spatial scales. Here, we analyzed the diversity of vascular plants, carabid beetles, and birds in agricultural landscapes in cereal crop fields at the field (n = 1350), farm (n = 270), and European-region (n = 9) scale. We partitioned diversity into its additive components alpha, beta, and gamma, and assessed the relative contribution of beta diversity to total species richness at each spatial scale. AI was determined using pesticide and fertilizer inputs, as well as tillage operations and categorized into low, medium, and high levels. As AI was not significantly related to landscape complexity, we could disentangle potential AI effects on local vs. landscape community homogenization. AI negatively affected the species richness of plants and birds, but not carabid beetles, at all spatial scales. Hence, local AI was closely correlated to beta diversity on larger scales up to the farm and region level, and thereby was an indicator of farm- and region-wide biodiversity losses. At the scale of farms (12.83-20.52%) and regions (68.34-80.18%), beta diversity accounted for the major part of the total species richness for all three taxa, indicating great dissimilarity in environmental conditions on larger spatial scales. For plants, relative importance of alpha diversity decreased with AI, while relative importance of beta diversity on the farm scale increased with AI for carabids and birds. Hence, and in contrast to our expectations, AI does not necessarily homogenize local communities, presumably due to the heterogeneity of farming practices. In conclusion, a more detailed understanding of AI effects on diversity patterns of various taxa and at multiple spatial scales would contribute to more efficient agri-environmental schemes in agroecosystems.",

    "title": "Deficiency of IL-22 Contributes to a Chronic Inflammatory Disease: Pathogenetic Mechanisms in Acne Inversa",
    "abstract": "Overexpression of the T cell cytokine IL-22 is linked to the development of some chronic diseases, but little is known about IL-22 deficiency in humans. As demonstrated in this study, acne inversa (AI; also designated as Hidradenitis suppurativa) lesions show a relative deficiency of IL-22 and IL-20, but not of IL-17A, IL-26, IFN-γ, IL-24, or IL-1β. Moreover, AI lesions had reduced expression of membranous IL-22 and IL-20 receptors and increased expression of the natural IL-22 inhibitor, IL-22 binding protein. AI is a chronic inflammatory skin disease with prevalence up to 4% of the population and in which cutaneous bacterial persistence represents an important pathogenetic factor. Accordingly, we also found a relative deficiency of antimicrobial proteins (AMPs) in AI lesions and a positive correlation between lesional IL-22 and IL-20 versus AMP levels. IL-22, like its tissue cell downstream mediator IL-20, upregulated AMPs in reconstituted human epidermis and was critical for increased AMP levels under inflammatory conditions. The relative IL-22 deficiency in AI was not linked to lesional T cell numbers or Th22/Th1/Th17 subset markers and -inducing cytokines. However, IL-10 was highly expressed in AI lesions and correlated negatively with IL-22 expression. Moreover, IL-10 inhibited IL-22 but not IL-17 production in vitro. The IL-10 overexpression, in turn, was not associated with an elevated presence of regulatory T cells but with the enhanced presence of an IL-10–inducing cytokine. We conclude that IL-22 deficiency may contribute to the pathogenesis of certain chronic disorders as postulated in this paper for AI.",

    "title": "A Survey of Artificial Intelligence for Cognitive Radios",
    "abstract": "Cognitive radio (CR) is an enabling technology for numerous new capabilities such as dynamic spectrum access, spectrum markets, and self-organizing networks. To realize this diverse set of applications, CR researchers leverage a variety of artificial intelligence (AI) techniques. To help researchers better understand the practical implications of AI to their CR designs, this paper reviews several CR implementations that used the following AI techniques: artificial neural networks (ANNs), metaheuristic algorithms, hidden Markov models (HMMs), rule-based systems, ontology-based systems (OBSs), and case-based systems (CBSs). Factors that influence the choice of AI techniques, such as responsiveness, complexity, security, robustness, and stability, are discussed. To provide readers with a more concrete understanding, these factors are illustrated in an extended discussion of two CR designs.",

    "title": "Artificial Intelligence as a Positive and Negative Factor in Global Risk",
    "abstract": "By far the greatest danger of Artificial Intelligence is that people conclude too early that they understand it. Of course this problem is not limited to the field of AI. Jacques Monod wrote: \"A curious aspect of the theory of evolution is that everybody thinks he understands it.\" (Monod 1974.) My father, a physicist, complained about people making up their own theories of physics; he wanted to know why people did not make up their own theories of chemistry. (Answer: They do.) Nonetheless the problem seems to be unusually acute in Artificial Intelligence. The field of AI has a reputation for making huge promises and then failing to deliver on them. Most observers conclude that AI is hard; as indeed it is. But the embarrassment does not stem from the difficulty. It is difficult to build a star from hydrogen, but the field of stellar astronomy does not have a terrible reputation for promising to build stars and then failing. The critical inference is not that AI is hard, but that, for some reason, it is very easy for people to think they know far more about Artificial Intelligence than they actually do.",

    "title": "Tonotopic organization in auditory cortex of the cat",
    "abstract": "Microelectrode mapping techniques were employed in the cat's auditory cortex to relate the best frequencies of a large population of neurons with their spatial loci. Based upon the best‐frequency distribution, the auditory region was divided into four complete and orderly tonotopic representations and a surrounding belt of cortex in which the tonotopic organization was more complex. The four auditory fields occupy a crescent‐shaped band of tissue which comprises portions of both the exposed gyral surfaces and sulcal banks of the ectosylvian cortex. The anterior auditory field (A) is situated most rostrally upon the anterior ectosylvian gyrus. It extends upon the ventral bank of the suprasylvian sulcus and upon the banks of the anterior ectosylvian sulcus. Adjoining field A caudally is the primary auditory field (AI), which extends across the middle ectosylvian gyrus and portions of both banks of the posterior ectosylvian sulcus. The representations of the highest best frequencies in fields A and AI are contiguous. Caudal and ventral to AI are located the posterior (P) and ventroposterior (VP) auditory fields. They lie mainly upon the caudal bank of the posterior ectosylvian sulcus but also extend upon the rostral bank and upon the posterior ectosylvian gyrus. The low best‐frequency representations of fields AI and P are contiguous, whereas the low best‐frequency representation of field VP lies near the ventral end of the posterior ectosylvian sulcus. Fields P and VP are joined along their middle and high best‐frequency representations. Within each auditory field isofrequency lines defined by the spatial loci of neurons with similar best frequencies are oriented orthogonal to the low‐to‐high best‐frequency gradients.",

    "title": "Systematic Review of Health Disparities for Cardiovascular Diseases and Associated Factors among American Indian and Alaska Native Populations",
    "abstract": "Background American Indians and Alaska Native (AI/AN) populations experience significant health disparities compared to non-Hispanic white populations. Cardiovascular disease and related risk factors are increasingly recognized as growing indicators of global health disparities. However, comparative reports on disparities among this constellation of diseases for AI/AN populations have not been systematically reviewed. Objectives We performed a literature review on the prevalence of diabetes, metabolic syndrome, dyslipidemia, obesity, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease; and associated morbidity and mortality among AI/AN. Data sources A total of 203 articles were reviewed, of which 31 met study criteria for inclusion. Searches were performed on PUBMED, MEDLINE, the CDC MMWR, and the Indian Health Services. Study eligibility criteria Published literature that were published within the last fifteen years and provided direct comparisons between AI/AN to non-AI/AN populations were included. Study appraisal and synthesis methods We abstracted data on study design, data source, AI/AN population, comparison group, and. outcome measures. A descriptive synthesis of primary findings is included. Results Rates of obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and metabolic syndrome are clearly higher for AI/AN populations. Hypertension and hyperlipidemia differences are more equivocal. Our analysis also revealed that there are likely regional and gender differences in the degree of disparities observed. Limitations Studies using BRFSS telephone surveys administered in English may underestimate disparities. Many AI/AN do not have telephones and/or speak English. Regional variability makes national surveys difficult to interpret. Finally, studies using self-reported data may not be accurate. Conclusions and implications of key findings Profound health disparities in cardiovascular diseases and associated risk factors for AI/AN populations persist, perhaps due to low socioeconomic status and access to quality healthcare. Successful programs will address social determinants and increase healthcare access. Community-based outreach to bring health services to the most vulnerable may also be very helpful in this effort.

To understand how artificial intelligence (AI) was framed in U.S. newspapers, a content analysis based on framing theory in journalism and science communication was conducted. This study identified the dominant topics and frames, as well as the risks and benefits of AI covered in five major American newspapers from 2009 to 2018. Results indicated that business and technology were the primary topics in news coverage of AI. The benefits of AI were discussed more frequently than its risks, but risks of AI were generally discussed with greater specificity. Additionally, episodic issue framing and societal impact framing were more frequently used.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nTo describe a clinicopathologic study of a large group of congenitally bicuspid aortic valves surgically excised at a single institution.\n\n\nMATERIAL AND METHODS\nThe medical charts and bicuspid valves from patients undergoing aortic valve replacement at Mayo Clinic Rochester between 1991 and 1996 were retrospectively reviewed.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe age of the 542 patients ranged from 1 to 86 years (mean, 61), and 372 (69%) were men. Among these, 409 (75%) had pure aortic stenosis (AS), 73 (13%) had pure aortic insufficiency (regurgitation) (AI), 53 (10%) had combined AS and AI, and 7 (1%) had normal function. The mean age was higher for those with AS than AI (65 versus 46 years; P < 0.001), whereas the male-to-female ratio was higher for AI than AS (17.3:1 versus 1.7:1; P < 0.001). The two cusps were not equal in size in 95%, and a raphe was present in 76% (67% typical, 9% atypical). Raphal position was described in 315 and was between the right and left cusps in 270 (86%). Raphal absence occurred more often in valves with equal-sized cusps than unequal (33% versus 14%; P = 0.005). Moderate to severe calcification affected valves with AS more frequently than AI (99% versus 41%; P < 0.001). In contrast, annular dilatation was associated with AI more than AS (48% versus 11%; P < 0.001). Acquired commissural fusion involved valves with combined AS and AI more often than the other functional states (31% versus 14%; P = 0.002). Sixteen patients (age range, 18 to 78 years; 13 men) had infective endocarditis (6 active, 10 healed), including 10 with AI (9 men), 3 with AS plus AI, 2 with AS, and 1 with normal function but embolization.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nFunctionally, the most common fate of congenitally bicuspid aortic valves was calcific stenosis with or without regurgitation (85%). Because approximately 4 million US citizens have bicuspid valves and because valve replacement is currently the only treatment of symptomatic AS, this disorder will continue to affect health-care costs.",

    "abstract": "The representation of sound frequency (and of the cochlear partition) within primary auditory cortex has been investigated with use of microelectrode-mapping techniques in a series of 25 anesthetized cats. Among the results were the following: 1) Within vertical penetrations into AI, best frequency and remarkably constant for successively studied neurons across the active middle and deep cortical layers. 2) There is an orderly representation of frequency (and of represented cochlear place) within AI. Frequency is rerepresented across the mediolateral dimension of the field. On an axis perpendicular to this plane of rerepresentation, best-frequency (represented cochlear place) changes as a simple function of cortical location. 3) Any given frequency band (or sector of the cochlear partition) is represented across a belt of cortex of nearly constant width that runs on a nearly straight axis across AI. 4) There is a disproportionately large cortical surface representation of the highest-frequency octaves (basal cochlea) within AI. 5) The primary and secondary field locations were somewhat variable, when referenced to cortical surface landmarks. 6) Data from long penetrations passing down the rostral bank of the posterior ectosylvian sulcus were consistent with the existence of a vertical unit of organization in AI, akin to cortical columns described in primary visual and somatosensory cortex. 7) Responses to tonal stimuli were encountered in fields dorsocaudal, caudal, ventral, and rostral to AI. There is an orderly representation of the cochlea within the field rostal to AI, with a reversal in best frequencies across its border with AI. 8) Physiological definitions of AI boundaries are consistent with their cytoarchitectonic definition. Some of the implications of these findings are discussed.",

    "abstract": "Background— Aortic insufficiency (AI) is increasingly recognized as a complication of continuous flow left ventricular assist device support; however, its long-term prevalence, clinical significance, and efficacy of potential interventions are not well known. Methods and Results— We studied the prevalence and management of AI in 232 patients with continuous flow left ventricular assist device at our institution. Patients with aortic valve (AV) surgery before left ventricular assist device implantation were excluded from analysis. To examine the prevalence of de novo AI, patients without preoperative AI were divided into a retrospective and a prospective cohort based on whether a dedicated speed optimization study had been performed at the time of discharge. Forty-three patients underwent AV repair at the time of implant, and 3 subsequently developed greater than mild AI. In patients without surgical AV manipulation and no AI at the time of implant, Kaplan–Meier analysis revealed that freedom from greater than mild de novo AI at 1 year was 77.6±4.2%, and that at least moderate AI is expected to develop in 37.6±13.3% after 3 years. Nonopening of the AV was strongly associated with de novo AI development in patients without prospective discharge speed optimization. Seven of 21 patients with at least moderate AI developed symptomatic heart failure requiring surgical intervention. Conclusions— AI is common in patients with continuous flow left ventricular assist devices and may lead to clinical decompensation requiring surgical correction. The prevalence of AI is substantially less in patients whose AV opens, and optimized loading conditions may reduce AI prevalence in those patients in whom AV opening cannot be achieved.",

    "abstract": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) already plays a major role in our daily life (e.g. intelligent household appliances like robotic vacuum cleaners or AI-based applications like Google Maps, Google Now, Siri, Cortana, ...). Sound knowledge about AI and the principles of computer science will be of vast importance for future careers in science and engineering. Looking towards the near future, jobs will largely be related to AI. In this context literacy in AI and computer science will become as important as classic literacy (reading/writing). By using an analogy with this process we developed a novel AI education concept aiming at fostering AI literacy. The concept comprises modules for different age groups on different educational levels. Fundamental AI/computer science topics addressed in each module are, amongst others, problem solving by search, sorting, graphs and data structures. We developed, conducted and evaluated four proof-of-concepts modules focusing on kindergarten/primary school as well as middle school, high school and university. Preliminary results of the pilot implementations indicate that the proposed AI education concept aiming at fostering AI literacy works.",

    "title": "Tonotopic organization, architectonic fields, and connections of auditory cortex in macaque monkeys",
    "abstract": "Microelectrode recordings were used to investigate the tonotopic organization of auditory cortex of macaque monkeys and guide the placement of injections of wheat germ agglutininhorse radish peroxidase (WGA‐HRP) and fluorescent dyes. Anatomical and physiological results were later related to histological distinctions in the same brains after sections were processed for cytoarchitecture, myeloarchitecture, acetylcholinesterase (AchE), or cytochrome oxidase (CO). The experiments produced serveral major findings. (1) Neurons throughout a broad expanse of cortex were highly responsive to pure tones, and best frequencies could be determined for neurons in arrays of recording sites. (2) The microelectrode recordings revealed two systematic representations of tone frequencies, the primary area (AI) and a primary‐like rostral field (R) as previously described. The representation of high to low frequency tones in A1 was largely caudorostral along the plane of the sulcus. A reversal of the order of representation of frequencies occurred in R. (3) AI and R together were coextensive with a koniocellular, densely myelinated zone that expressed high levels of AchE and CO. These architectonic features were somewhat less pronounced in R than AI, but a clear border between the two areas was not apparent. (4) Cortex bordering AI and R was less responsive to tones, but when best frequencies for neurons could be determined, they matched those for adjoining parts of AI and R. (5) Architectonically distinct regions were apparent within some of the cortex bordering AI and R. (6) The major ipsilateral cortical connections of AI were with R and cortex immediately lateral and medial to AI. (7) Callosal connections of AI were predominately with matched locations in the opposite AI, but they also included adjoining fields. (8) Neurons in the ventral (MGV), medial (MGM), and dorsal (MGD) nuclei of the medial geniculate complex projected to AI and cortex lateral to AI. (9) Injections in cortex responsive to high frequency tones labeled more dorsal parts of MGV than injections in cortex responsive to low frequency tones. © 1993 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.",

    "title": "Increased Prevalence of Metabolic Syndrome in Patients with Acne Inversa",
    "abstract": "Background Acne inversa (AI; also designated as Hidradenitis suppurativa) is a common chronic inflammatory skin disease, localized in the axillary, inguinal and perianal skin areas that causes painful, fistulating sinuses with malodorous purulence and scars. Several chronic inflammatory diseases are associated with the metabolic syndrome and its consequences including arteriosclerosis, coronary heart disease, myocardial infraction, and stroke. So far, the association of AI with systemic metabolic alterations is largely unexplored. Methods and Findings A hospital-based case-control study in 80 AI patients and 100 age- and sex-matched control participants was carried out. The prevalence of central obesity (odds ratio 5.88), hypertriglyceridemia (odds ratio 2.24), hypo-HDL-cholesterolemia (odds ratio 4.56), and hyperglycemia (odds ratio 4.09) in AI patients was significantly higher than in controls. Furthermore, the metabolic syndrome, previously defined as the presence of at least three of the five alterations listed above, was more common in those patients compared to controls (40.0% versus 13.0%; odds ratio 4.46, 95% confidence interval 2.02 to 9.96; P<0.001). AI patients with metabolic syndrome also had more pronounced metabolic alterations than controls with metabolic syndrome. Interestingly, there was no correlation between the severity or duration of the disease and the levels of respective parameters or the number of criteria defining the metabolic syndrome. Rather, the metabolic syndrome was observed in a disproportionately high percentage of young AI patients. Conclusions This study shows for the first time that AI patients have a high prevalence of the metabolic syndrome and all of its criteria. It further suggests that the inflammation present in AI patients does not have a major impact on the development of metabolic alterations. Instead, evidence is given for a role of metabolic alterations in the development of AI. We recommend monitoring of AI patients in order to correct their modifiable cardiovascular risk factors.",

    "abstract": "As the influence and use of artificial intelligence (AI) have grown and its transformative potential has become more apparent, many questions have been raised regarding the economic, political, social, and ethical implications of its use. Public opinion plays an important role in these discussions, influencing product adoption, commercial development, research funding, and regulation. In this paper we present results of an in-depth survey of public opinion of artificial intelligence conducted with 10,005 respondents spanning eight countries and six continents. We report widespread perception that AI will have significant impact on society, accompanied by strong support for the responsible development and use of AI, and also characterize the public's sentiment towards AI with four key themes (exciting, useful, worrying, and futuristic) whose prevalence distinguishes response to AI in different countries.",

    "title": "Evidence that genetic instability occurs at an early stage of colorectal tumorigenesis.",
    "abstract": "Chromosomal instability is believed to be a common feature of most human tumors, but the stage at which such instability originates has not been defined. At the molecular level, chromosomal instability is characterized by allelic imbalance (AI), representing losses or gains of defined chromosomal regions. We have assessed AI in early colorectal tumors using newly developed methods for assessing AI in complex cell populations. A total of 32 adenomas of average size (2 mm; range, 1-3 mm) were studied. AI of chromosome 5q markers occurred in 55% of tumors analyzed, consistent with a gatekeeping role of the adenomatous polyposis coli tumor suppressor gene located at chromosomal position 5q21. AI was also detected in each of the other four chromosomes tested. The fractions of adenomas with AI of chromosomes 1p, 8p, 15q, and 18q were 10,19, 28, and 28%, respectively. Over 90% of the tumors exhibited AI of at least one chromosome, and 67% had allelic imbalance of a chromosome other than 5q. These findings demonstrate that AI is a common event, even in very small tumors, and suggest that chromosomal instability occurs very early during colorectal neoplasia.",

    "title": "Autoinducer 2: a concentration‐dependent signal for mutualistic bacterial biofilm growth",
    "abstract": "4,5‐dihydroxy‐2,3‐pentanedione (DPD), a product of the LuxS enzyme in the catabolism of S‐ribosylhomocysteine, spontaneously cyclizes to form autoinducer 2 (AI‐2). AI‐2 is proposed to be a universal signal molecule mediating interspecies communication among bacteria. We show that mutualistic and abundant biofilm growth in flowing saliva of two human oral commensal bacteria, Actinomyces naeslundii T14V and Streptococcus oralis 34, is dependent upon production of AI‐2 by S. oralis 34. A luxS mutant of S. oralis 34 was constructed which did not produce AI‐2. Unlike wild‐type dual‐species biofilms, A. naeslundii T14V and an S. oralis 34 luxS mutant did not exhibit mutualism and generated only sparse biofilms which contained a 10‐fold lower biomass of each species. Restoration of AI‐2 levels by genetic or chemical (synthetic AI‐2 in the form of DPD) complementation re‐established the mutualistic growth and high biomass characteristic for the wild‐type dual‐species biofilm. Furthermore, an optimal concentration of DPD was determined, above and below which biofilm formation was suppressed. The optimal concentration was 100‐fold lower than the detection limit of the currently accepted AI‐2 assay. Thus, AI‐2 acts as an interspecies signal and its concentration is critical for mutualism between two species of oral bacteria grown under conditions that are representative of the human oral cavity.",

    "abstract": "It goes without saying that coronavirus (COVID-19) is an infectious disease and many countries are coping with its different variants. Owing to the limited medical facilities, vaccine and medical experts, need of the hour is to intelligently tackle its spread by making artificial intelligence (AI) based smart decisions for COVID-19 suspects who develop different symptoms and they are kept under observation and monitored to see the severity of the symptoms. The target of this study is to analyze COVID-19 suspects data and detect whether a suspect is a COVID-19 patient or not, and if yes, then to what extent, so that a suitable decision can be made. The decision can be categorized such that an infected person can be isolated or quarantined at home or at a facilitation center or the person can be sent to the hospital for the treatment. This target is achieved by designing a mathematical model of COVID-19 suspects in the form of a multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) model and a novel AI based technique is devised and implemented with the help of newly developed plithogenic distance and similarity measures in fuzzy environment. All findings are depicted graphically for a clear understanding and to provide an insight of the necessity and effectiveness of the proposed method. The concept and results of the proposed technique make it suitable for implementation in machine learning, deep learning, pattern recognition etc.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE(S)\nTo develop and assess AI algorithms to identify operative steps in laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG).\n\n\nBACKGROUND\nComputer vision, a form of artificial intelligence (AI), allows for quantitative analysis of video by computers for identification of objects and patterns, such as in autonomous driving.\n\n\nMETHODS\nIntraoperative video from LSG from an academic institution was annotated by 2 fellowship-trained, board-certified bariatric surgeons. Videos were segmented into the following steps: 1) port placement, 2) liver retraction, 3) liver biopsy, 4) gastrocolic ligament dissection, 5) stapling of the stomach, 6) bagging specimen, and 7) final inspection of staple line. Deep neural networks were used to analyze videos. Accuracy of operative step identification by the AI was determined by comparing to surgeon annotations.\n\n\nRESULTS\nEighty-eight cases of LSG were analyzed. A random 70% sample of these clips was used to train the AI and 30% to test the AI's performance. Mean concordance correlation coefficient for human annotators was 0.862, suggesting excellent agreement. Mean (±SD) accuracy of the AI in identifying operative steps in the test set was 82% ± 4% with a maximum of 85.6%.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nAI can extract quantitative surgical data from video with 85.6% accuracy. This suggests operative video could be used as a quantitative data source for research in intraoperative clinical decision support, risk prediction, or outcomes studies.",

    "abstract": "SUMMARY This study examined the ethnic difference in the association between increased serum ferritin (SF) (>300 μg/l) and acute inflammation (AI) (C-reactive protein ⩾1·0 mg/dl) between black and white males aged ⩾20 years. Using data from the third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III), we determined the risk for having elevated SF in black males (n=164) and white males (n=325) with AI present as well as black males (n=1731) and white males (n=2877) with AI absent. Black subjects with AI present were 1·71 times (95% CI 1·18–2·49), and 1·87 times (95% CI 1·46–2·40) more likely to have increased SF than AI absent blacks and AI present whites, respectively. Furthermore, with AI present, every increment of C-reactive protein, white blood cell count, serum albumin, lymphocyte count and platelet count was associated with higher odds of having elevations in SF in blacks than whites. Regardless of AI status, blacks were more likely to have elevations in SF than whites, and the prevalence of elevated SF was significantly higher in blacks than whites. This finding suggested that black males may respond to inflammation with a more aggressive rise in SF compared to white males. Future research is needed to investigate the underlying mechanisms.",

Face-to-face structured interviews were conducted with 86% of traceable, living relatives (n = 1, 753) and 88% of traceable, living probands (n = 415).\n\n\nRESULTS\nIn interviewed relatives, the lifetime risks (+/- SE) for schizophrenia, as a function of the \"blind\" proband diagnosis, were as follows: schizophrenia, 6.5% +/- 1.6%; schizoaffective disorder, 6.8% +/- 2.5%; schizotypal personality disorder, 6.9% +/- 3.9%; other nonaffective psychoses, 5.1% +/- 2.4%; psychotic AI, 2.8% +/- 1.2%; nonpsychotic AI, 0.6% +/- 0.6%; and control, 0.5% +/- 0.3%. Individuals with schizophrenia reproduced at a rate about one quarter that of controls and the risk for schizophrenia in parents of probands was much less than that found in siblings.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThese results support the following hypotheses: (1) in the West of Ireland, as in other populations, schizophrenia is a strongly familial disorder; (2) schizophrenia shares a familial predisposition with a spectrum of clinical syndromes that includes schizoaffective disorder, other nonaffective psychoses, schizotypal personality disorder, and probably psychotic AI, but not nonpsychotic AI; and (3) the diminished reproductive rates associated with schizophrenia have a large impact on the pattern of risk of illness in relatives.",

    "title": "Cell‐to‐cell signalling in Escherichia coli and Salmonella enterica",
    "abstract": "Cell‐to‐cell signalling in prokaryotes that leads to co‐ordinated behaviour has been termed quorum sensing. This type of signalling can have profound impacts on microbial community structure and host–microbe interactions. The Gram‐negative quorum‐sensing systems were first discovered and extensively characterized in the marine Vibrios. Some components of the Vibrio systems are present in the classical genetic model organisms Escherichia coli and Salmonella enterica. Both organisms encode a signal receptor of the LuxR family, SdiA, but not a corresponding signal‐generating enzyme. Instead, SdiA of Salmonella detects and responds to signals generated only by other microbial species. Conversely, E. coli and Salmonella encode the signal‐generating component of a second system (a LuxS homologue that generates AI‐2), but the sensory apparatus for AI‐2 differs substantially from the Vibrio system. The only genes currently known to be regulated by AI‐2 in Salmonella encode an active uptake and modification system for AI‐2. Therefore, it is not yet clear whether Salmonella uses AI‐2 as a signal molecule or whether AI‐2 has some other function. In E. coli, the functions of both SdiA and AI‐2 are unclear due to pleiotropy. Genetic strategies to identify novel signalling systems have been performed with E. coli and Providencia stuartii. Several putative signalling systems have been identified, one that uses indole as a signal and another that releases what appears to be a peptide. The latter system has homologues in E. coli and Salmonella, as well as other bacteria, plants and animals. In fact, the protease components from Providencia and Drosophila are functionally interchangeable.",

    "title": "Application of Artificial Intelligence Technology in Oncology: Towards the Establishment of Precision Medicine",
    "abstract": "Simple Summary Artificial intelligence (AI) technology has been advancing rapidly in recent years and is being implemented in society. The medical field is no exception, and the clinical implementation of AI-equipped medical devices is steadily progressing. In particular, AI is expected to play an important role in realizing the current global trend of precision medicine. In this review, we introduce the history of AI as well as the state of the art of medical AI, focusing on the field of oncology. We also describe the current status of the use of AI for drug discovery in the oncology field. Furthermore, while AI has great potential, there are still many issues that need to be resolved; therefore, we would provide details on current medical AI problems and potential solutions. Abstract In recent years, advances in artificial intelligence (AI) technology have led to the rapid clinical implementation of devices with AI technology in the medical field. More than 60 AI-equipped medical devices have already been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the United States, and the active introduction of AI technology is considered to be an inevitable trend in the future of medicine. In the field of oncology, clinical applications of medical devices using AI technology are already underway, mainly in radiology, and AI technology is expected to be positioned as an important core technology. In particular, “precision medicine,” a medical treatment that selects the most appropriate treatment for each patient based on a vast amount of medical data such as genome information, has become a worldwide trend; AI technology is expected to be utilized in the process of extracting truly useful information from a large amount of medical data and applying it to diagnosis and treatment. In this review, we would like to introduce the history of AI technology and the current state of medical AI, especially in the oncology field, as well as discuss the possibilities and challenges of AI technology in the medical field.",

    "title": "Effect of time of artificial insemination on pregnancy rates, calving rates, pregnancy loss, and gender ratio after synchronization of ovulation in lactating dairy cows.",
    "abstract": "In order to assess the optimal time of artificial insemination (AI) in relation to ovulation, lactating dairy cows (n = 732) from herds with rolling herd averages of 9980 to 11,800 kg from three milkings per day were randomly assigned to five groups by stage of lactation and parity. Ovulation was synchronized by administration of GnRH followed 7 d later with PGF2 alpha followed 2 d later with a second treatment with GnRH. Cows were inseminated at 0, 8, 16, 24, or 32 h after the second injection of GnRH (ovulation occurs between 24 and 32 h after GnRH). Pregnancy diagnoses were performed by ultrasound at 25 to 35 d post-AI. Pregnancy rates per AI were similar for the groups inseminated at 0, 8, 16, and 24 h and lower for the group inseminated at 32 h. A significant quadratic effect of treatment suggests that the middle time periods (8, 16, and 24 h) may produce the greatest pregnancy rate per AI. However, the group inseminated at 0 h had lowest pregnancy loss, and the group inseminated at 32 h tended to have the greatest pregnancy loss compared with that of the other groups. The calving rate was similar between the groups inseminated at 0, 8, 16, and 24 h and lower in the group inseminated at 32 h. The time of AI also appeared to affect gender of calf: cows bred at 0 and 32 h having a higher percentage of female offspring. In conclusion, there appears to be substantial flexibility in the time of AI after the second injection of GnRH, and lower reproductive rates were observed only when AI was after the time of ovulation.",

    "title": "Building Problem Solvers",
    "abstract": "From the Publisher: \nFor nearly two decades, Kenneth Forbus and Johan de Kleer have accumulated a substantial body of knowledge about the principles and practice of creating problem solvers. In some cases they are the inventors of the ideas or techniques described, and in others, participants in their development. Building Problem Solvers communicates this knowledge in a focused, cohesive manner. It is unique among standard artificial intelligence texts in combining science and engineering, theory and craft to describe the construction of AI reasoning systems, and it includes code illustrating the ideas. After working through Building Problem Solvers, readers should have a deep understanding of pattern directed inference systems, constraint languages, and truth-maintenance systems. The diligent reader will have worked through several substantial examples, including systems that perform symbolic algebra, natural deduction, resolution, qualitative reasoning, planning, diagnosis, scene analysis, and temporal reasoning. Along the way Forbus and de Kleer teach the art of building robust AI software. They begin with simple examples such as search programs, and move to more complex cases on the cutting edge of AI techniques, such as model-based diagnosis systems and a qualitative reasoner. This software has been tested and used extensively by graduate students and programmers in industry. Although Building Problem Solvers is designed primarily as a text for advanced AI classes or AI programming classes, it can be used by researchers in universities and industrial laboratories who want to apply these techniques in their work, and by programmers who want to incorporate these ideas in their applications.",

    "title": "Antihepcidin antibody treatment modulates iron metabolism and is effective in a mouse model of inflammation-induced anemia.",
    "abstract": "Iron maldistribution has been implicated in multiple diseases, including the anemia of inflammation (AI), atherosclerosis, diabetes, and neurodegenerative disorders. Iron metabolism is controlled by hepcidin, a 25-amino acid peptide. Hepcidin is induced by inflammation, causes iron to be sequestered, and thus, potentially contributes to AI. Human hepcidin (hHepc) overexpression in mice caused an iron-deficient phenotype, including stunted growth, hair loss, and iron-deficient erythropoiesis. It also caused resistance to supraphysiologic levels of erythropoiesis-stimulating agent, supporting the hypothesis that hepcidin may influence response to treatment in AI. To explore the role of hepcidin in inflammatory anemia, a mouse AI model was developed with heat-killed Brucella abortus treatment. Suppression of hepcidin mRNA was a successful anemia treatment in this model. High-affinity antibodies specific for hHepc were generated, and hHepc knock-in mice were produced to enable antibody testing. Antibody treatment neutralized hHepc in vitro and in vivo and facilitated anemia treatment in hHepc knock-in mice with AI. These data indicate that antihepcidin antibodies may be an effective treatment for patients with inflammatory anemia. The ability to manipulate iron metabolism in vivo may also allow investigation of the role of iron in a number of other pathologic conditions.",

    "abstract": "The optimal time of artificial insemination (AI) was determined from data for 2661 AI in 17 herds utilizing a radiotelemetric system for estrus detection that has the potential for continuous 24-h surveillance to monitor behavioral events associated with estrus. The system consisted of pressure-sensitive radio frequency transmitters affixed over the sacrum region of cows. The activation of the sensor sent a radiotelemetric signal to a microcomputer via a fixed antenna. Cow identification, date, time, and duration of each standing event were recorded in the software program provided with the system. Each farm selected a 3-h interval to AI for cows that were identified in estrus during the previous 24 h. Pregnancy status was determined from data for return to estrus and palpation of the uterus 35 to 75 d following AI. Standing events during estrus averaged (+/- SD) 8.5 +/- 6.6 per cow, and the number of events per estrus across herds averaged from 6.2 +/- 5.1 to 12.8 +/- 9.9 per cow. The duration of estrus ranged from 5.1 +/- 3.8 to 10.6 +/- 6.8 h across herds; the mean was 7.1 +/- 5.4 h. The interval from the first standing event to AI affected the probability of pregnancy; the highest conception rates for AI occurred between 4 and 12 h after the onset of standing activity. The probability of pregnancy was higher for cows > 100 d in milk, exhibiting > 2 standing events during estrus, and inseminated during March, April or May.",

    "abstract": "Twenty cases of the use of appreciative inquiry (AI) for changing social systems published before 2003 were examined to look for the presence or absence of transformational change and the use of seven principles and practices culled from a review of the theoretical literature on AI. Although all cases began by collecting stories of the positive, followed the 4-D model, and adhered to five principles of AI articulated by Cooperrider and Whitney, only seven (35%) showed transformational outcomes. Highly consistent differences between the transformational cases and the others led the authors to conclude that two qualities of appreciative inquiry that are different from conventional organizational development and change management prescriptions are key to AI's transformative potential: (a) a focus on changing how people think instead of what people do and (b) a focus on supporting self-organizing change processes that flow from new ideas.",

    "title": "LuxS-Based Signaling in Streptococcus gordonii: Autoinducer 2 Controls Carbohydrate Metabolism and Biofilm Formation with Porphyromonas gingivalis",
    "abstract": "ABSTRACT Communication based on autoinducer 2 (AI-2) is widespread among gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria, and the AI-2 pathway can control the expression of genes involved in a variety of metabolic pathways and pathogenic mechanisms. In the present study, we identified luxS, a gene responsible for the synthesis of AI-2, in Streptococcus gordonii, a major component of the dental plaque biofilm. S. gordonii conditioned medium induced bioluminescence in an AI-2 reporter strain of Vibrio harveyi. An isogenic mutant of S. gordonii, generated by insertional inactivation of the luxS gene, was unaffected in growth and in its ability to form biofilms on polystyrene surfaces. In contrast, the mutant strain failed to induce bioluminescence in V. harveyi and was unable to form a mixed species biofilm with a LuxS-null strain of the periodontal pathogen Porphyromonas gingivalis. Complementation of the luxS mutation in S. gordonii restored normal biofilm formation with the luxS-deficient P. gingivalis. Differential display PCR demonstrated that the inactivation of S. gordonii luxS downregulated the expression of a number of genes, including gtfG, encoding glucosyltransferase; fruA, encoding extracellular exo-β-d-fructosidase; and lacD encoding tagatose 1,6-diphosphate aldolase. However, S. gordonii cell surface expression of SspA and SspB proteins, previously implicated in mediating adhesion between S. gordonii and P. gingivalis, was unaffected by inactivation of luxS. The results suggest that S. gordonii produces an AI-2-like signaling molecule that regulates aspects of carbohydrate metabolism in the organism. Furthermore, LuxS-dependent intercellular communication is essential for biofilm formation between nongrowing cells of P. gingivalis and S. gordonii.",

    "abstract": "Clinically, the lethal phenotypes of human prostate cancer are characterized by their progression to androgen‐independence and their propensity to form osseous metastases. We reported previously on the establishment of androgen‐independent (AI) human prostate cancer cell lines derived from androgen‐dependent (AD) LNCaP cells, with androgen independence defined as the capability of prostate cancer cells to grow in castrated hosts. One of the sublines, C4‐2, was found to be AI, highly tumorigenic, and metastatic, having a proclivity for metastasis to the bone.",

    "title": "Regulatory role of arginase I and II in nitric oxide, polyamine, and proline syntheses in endothelial cells.",
    "abstract": "Endothelial cells (EC) metabolize L-arginine mainly by arginase, which exists as two distinct isoforms, arginase I and II. To understand the roles of arginase isoforms in EC arginine metabolism, bovine coronary venular EC were stably transfected with the Escherichia coli lacZ gene (lacZ-EC, control), rat arginase I cDNA (AI-EC), or mouse arginase II cDNA (AII-EC). Western blots and enzymatic assays confirmed high-level expression of arginase I in the cytosol of AI-EC and of arginase II in mitochondria of AII-EC. For determining arginine catabolism, EC were cultured for 24 h in DMEM containing 0.4 mM L-arginine plus [1-(14)C]arginine. Urea formation, which accounted for nearly all arginine consumption by these cells, was enhanced by 616 and 157% in AI-EC and AII-EC, respectively, compared with lacZ-EC. Arginine uptake was 31-33% greater in AI-EC and AII-EC than in lacZ-EC. Intracellular arginine content was 25 and 11% lower in AI-EC and AII-EC, respectively, compared with lacZ-EC. Basal nitric oxide (NO) production was reduced by 60% in AI-EC and by 47% in AII-EC. Glutamate and proline production from arginine increased by 164 and 928% in AI-EC and by 79 and 295% in AII-EC, respectively, compared with lacZ-EC. Intracellular content of putrescine and spermidine was increased by 275 and 53% in AI-EC and by 158 and 43% in AII-EC, respectively, compared with lacZ-EC. Our results indicate that arginase expression can modulate NO synthesis in bovine venular EC and that basal levels of arginase I and II are limiting for endothelial syntheses of polyamines, proline, and glutamate and may have important implications for wound healing, angiogenesis, and cardiovascular function.",

    "title": "LuxS: its role in central metabolism and the in vitro synthesis of 4-hydroxy-5-methyl-3(2H)-furanone.",
    "abstract": "Many bacteria produce extracellular molecules which function in cell-to-cell communication. One of these molecules, autoinducer 2 (AI-2), was first described as an extracellular signal produced by Vibrio harveyi to control luciferase expression. Subsequently, a number of bacteria have been shown to possess AI-2 activity in their culture supernatants, and bear the luxS gene product, which is required for AI-2 synthesis. In Porphyromonas gingivalis, luxS and pfs, encoding a 5'-methylthioadenosine/S-adenosylhomocysteine nucleosidase (MTA/SAH'ase), form an operon, suggesting that S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH) or 5'-methylthioadenosine (MTA) serves as a substrate for AI-2 production. Cell-free extracts of Escherichia coli MG1655, but not DH5alpha (which carries a luxS frame-shift mutation) were capable of generating AI-2 activity upon addition of SAH, but not MTA. S-Ribosyl-homocysteine (RH) derived from SAH also served as a substrate in E. coli MG1655 extracts. RH-supplemented cell-free extracts of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a bacterium that lacks luxS, only generated AI-2 activity following the introduction of a plasmid containing the Por. gingivalis pfs-luxS operon. In addition, defined in vitro systems consisting of the purified LuxS proteins from Por. gingivalis, E. coli, Neisseria meningitidis or Staphylococcus aureus converted RH to homocysteine and a compound that exhibits AI-2 activity.4-Hydroxy-5-methyl-3(2H)-furanone was identified by mass spectrometry analysis as a major product formed in this in vitro reaction. In E. coli MG1655, expression of T3SH [the bacteriophage T3 S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) hydrolase] significantly reduced AI-2 activity in culture supernatants, suggesting that AI-2 production is limited by the amount of SAH produced in SAM-dependent transmethylase reactions. The authors suggest that the LuxS protein has an important metabolic function in the recycling of SAH. They also show that Ps. aeruginosa is capable of removing AI-2 activity, implying that this molecule may act as a nutrient. In many bacteria AI-2 may in fact represent not a signal molecule but a metabolite which is released early and metabolized in the later stages of growth.",

    "title": "Left ventricular myocardial structure in aortic valve disease before, intermediate, and late after aortic valve replacement.",
    "abstract": "Left ventricular biplane cineangiography, micromanometry, and endomyocardial biopsies were performed in 27 patients with aortic stenosis (AS) and in 17 patients with aortic insufficiency (AI). Twenty-three patients with AS and 15 with AI were restudied at an intermediate time (18 months after successful valve replacement), and nine patients with AS and six with AI were restudied late (70 and 62 months after surgery). Biopsy samples were evaluated for muscle fiber diameter, percent interstitial fibrosis, and volume fraction of myofibrils. In control biopsy samples obtained from five donor hearts at transplantation, these morphometric variables averaged 21.2 microns, 7.0%, and 57.2%, respectively. After surgery, mass determined by cineangiography decreased from 186 to 115 and 94 g/m2 in patients with AS and from 201 to 131 and 93 g/m2 in patients with AI. At the three studies, muscle fiber diameter was 30.9, 28.0, and 28.7 microns in patients with AS and was 31.4, 27.6, and 26.4 microns in patients with AI. Percent interstitial fibrosis was 18.2, 25.8, and 13.7% in patients with AS and was 20.4, 23.7, and 19.2% in patients with AI. Left ventricular fibrous content decreased from 34.2 to 29.8 and to 12.7 g/m2 in patients with AS and from 42.1 to 28.9 and to 18.9 g/m2 in patients with AI. Volume fraction of myofibrils was 57.7, 56.8, and 49.0% in patients with AS and was 56.8, 56.6 and 48.8% in patients with AI. Thus, the decrease of muscle mass determined by cineangiography at the intermediate time after valve replacement is mediated by regression of myocardial cellular hypertrophy in patients with AS and AI and in addition by a decrease of fibrous content in patients with AI. Late after surgery, left ventricular fibrous content also decreases in patients with AS. This late decrease associated with minor changes of end-diastolic volume may be important for improvement of increased diastolic myocardial stiffness. Even 6-7 years after valve replacement, incomplete regression of structural abnormalities of left ventricular hypertrophy still exists compared with the normal myocardium. The residually increased relative interstitial fibrosis and the small late postoperative decrease of volume fraction of myofibrils, associated with a prosthesis-related slight left ventricular pressure increase, are at the origin of a persistent systolic overload at the myofibrillar level.",

    "abstract": "There is a tendency for increased hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) activity with age in the rat, and the resulting elevations in circulating glucocorticoid levels have been implicated in the occurrence of hippocampal pathology and memory deficits. In the experiments reported here, we examined whether HPA dysfunction is selectively associated with cognitive impairments in a population of aged rats. Fifty-eight 23-27-month-old male Long-Evans rats were screened for spatial memory impairments using the Morris swim maze, and 2 groups of aged animals were selected; aged, cognitively impaired (AI) animals whose performance was significantly different (greater than 2 SD) from that of 6-month-old controls and aged, cognitively unimpaired (AU) animals whose performance was comparable to that of the young controls (a difference of less than 0.5 SD). Twenty-eight percent of the animals tested were designated as AI and 20% as AU. Histological analysis of a subset of these animals showed that, while both AU and AI animals showed neuron loss in the pyramidal cell fields of the hippocampus, the loss was significantly greater in the AI animals. The AI animals showed clear evidence of increased HPA activity. Thus, basal ACTH and corticosterone levels were significantly higher in the AI animals compared with both AU animals and young controls, especially during the dark phase of the cycle. The AI, AU, and young animals exhibited comparable corticosterone levels during a 20-min immobilization stress; however, following the termination of the stressor, corticosterone levels in AI animals were significantly elevated compared with both AU animals and controls.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nThere is mounting evidence that current replacement regimens fail to restore health-related subjective health status fully in patients with adrenal insufficiency (AI). Here we evaluated the subjective health status in primary and secondary AI and the effect of concomitant disease.\n\n\nMETHODS\nIn a cross-sectional study, all AI patients registered with the University Hospital Wuerzburg (n = 148) or with the German Self-Help Network (n = 200) were contacted by mail. Underlying diagnoses and comorbidities were verified by review of medical records. Patients were asked to complete three validated self-assessment questionnaires [Short Form 36 (SF-36), Giessen Complaint List (GBB-24), Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS)]. Results were compared to sex- and age-matched controls drawn from the questionnaire-specific reference cohorts.\n\n\nRESULTS\nWe identified 348 patients, and 256 agreed to participate. Completed questionnaire sets were available from 210 patients [primary AI (n = 132), secondary AI (n = 78)]. Seven of eight SF-36 dimensions, all five GBB-24 scales, and the HADS anxiety score reflected significant impairment of subjective health status in both AI cohorts (all P < 0.001). Even after exclusion of all patients with any concomitant disease, subjective health status remained significantly impaired in five SF-36 subscales and four GBB-24 subscales. Secondary AI patients were slightly more compromised than primary AI, significant with regard to two SF-36 scales (P < 0.05) and the HADS depression score (P < 0.001). A total of 18.3% of the AI patients were out of work, compared to 4.1% in the general population.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nPatients with AI on current standard replacement suffer from significantly impaired health-related subjective health status, irrespective of origin of disease or concomitant disease. Future studies will have to assess whether more physiological glucocorticoid replacement strategies in AI will ameliorate these impairments.",

    "abstract": "In a process called quorum sensing, bacteria communicate with one another by exchanging chemical signals called autoinducers. In the bioluminescent marine bacterium Vibrio harveyi, two different auto inducers (AI‐1 and AI‐2) regulate light emission. Detection of and response to the V.harveyi autoinducers are accomplished through two two‐component sensory relay systems: AI‐1 is detected by the sensor LuxN and AI‐2 by LuxPQ. Here we further define the V.harveyi quorum‐sensing regulon by identifying 10 new quorum‐sensing‐controlled target genes. Our examination of signal processing and integration in the V.harveyi quorum‐sensing circuit suggests that AI‐1 and AI‐2 act synergistically, and that the V.harveyi quorum‐sensing circuit may function exclusively as a ‘coincidence detector’ that discriminates between conditions in which both autoinducers are present and all other conditions.",

    "title": "A deduction model of belief",
    "abstract": "Representing and reasoning about the knowledge an agent (human or computer) must have to accomplish some task is becoming an increasingly important issue in artificial intelligence (AI) research. To reason about an agent's beliefs, an AI system must assume some formal model of those beliefs. An attractive candidate is the Deductive Belief model: an agent's beliefs are described as a set of sentences in some formal language (the base sentences), together with a deductive process for deriving consequences of those beliefs. In particular, a Deductive Belief model can account for the effect of resource limitations on deriving consequences of the base set: an agent need not believe all the logical consequences of his beliefs. In this paper we develop a belief model based on the notion of deduction, and contrast it with current AI formalisms for belief derived from Hintikka/Kripke possible-worlds semantics for knowledge.",

The goal of this book is to remedy this situation by bringing together in one place a set of readings that can be used to develop a familiarity with the planning literature, with the major AI theory underlying planning, and with the exciting directions of current research. \n \nThe first section of the book introduces the techniques and terminology of the AI planning community. The second section collects papers describing planning systems developed over the past 30 years. A third section presents research in the area of formal models of planning. Finally, a fourth section collects recent work representative of the field's current direction. The editors, three accomplished researchers, provide introductory material surveying the field of planning as well as introductions to groups of papers placing the work in perspective. \n \nA useful reference for AI system developers and researchers, this work is also suitable for use as a text for a planning course or as a supplemental text for a more general AI course.",

    "abstract": "This study assessed the diagnostic value of the cytomegalovirus (CMV)-specific IgG avidity index (AI) for pregnant women without a history of CMV seroconversion. Sera were studied from 40 women with CMV seroconversion (group I), 70 with past CMV infection (group II), 10 (20 sera) with serologic reactivation (group III), and 41 with CMV-specific IgM without proven seroconversion (group IV). Sera from women in group I collected <14 weeks after seroconversion had a low AI (mean, 30% +/- 12%), whereas all sera from women in group II had an AI >60% (mean, 88% +/- 9%). Among the 41 babies born to group IV women, only 4 were infected with CMV (all born to mothers with a low [<30%] AI early in pregnancy). These results suggest that AI determination may help to date a primary CMV infection in pregnant women who lack seroconversion history.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) tools, such as expert systems, fuzzy logic, and neural networks are expected to usher a new era in power electronics and motion control in the coming decades. Although these technologies have advanced significantly and have found wide applications, they have hardly touched the power electronics and machine drives area. The paper describes these AI tools and their application in the area of power electronics and motion control. The body of the paper is subdivided into three sections which describe, respectively, the principles and applications of expert systems, fuzzy logic, and neural networks. The theoretical portion of each topic is of direct relevance to the application of power electronics. The example applications in the paper are taken from the published literature. >",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT Bacterial cell-to-cell communication facilitates coordinated expression of specific genes in a growth rate-II and cell density-dependent manner, a process known as quorum sensing. While the discovery of a diffusible Escherichia coli signaling pheromone, termed autoinducer 2 (AI-2), has been made along with several quorum sensing genes, the overall number and coordination of genes controlled by quorum sensing through the AI-2 signal has not been studied systematically. We investigated global changes in mRNA abundance elicited by the AI-2 signaling molecule through the use of aluxS mutant that was unable to synthesize AI-2. Remarkably, 242 genes, comprising ca. 5.6% of the E. coli genome, exhibited significant transcriptional changes (either induction or repression) in response to a 300-fold AI-2 signaling differential, with many of the identified genes displaying high induction levels (more than fivefold). Significant induction of ygeV, a putative ς54-dependent transcriptional activator, andyhbH, a ς54 modulating protein, suggests ς54 may be involved in E. coli quorum sensing.",

    "title": "NMR-based characterization of metabolic alterations in hypertension using an adaptive, intelligent binning algorithm.",
    "abstract": "As with every -omics technology, metabolomics requires new methodologies for data processing. Due to the large spectral size, a standard approach in NMR-based metabolomics implies the division of spectra into equally sized bins, thereby simplifying subsequent data analysis. Yet, disadvantages are the loss of information and the occurrence of artifacts caused by peak shifts. Here, a new binning algorithm, Adaptive Intelligent Binning (AI-Binning), which largely circumvents these problems, is presented. AI-Binning recursively identifies bin edges in existing bins, requires only minimal user input, and avoids the use of arbitrary parameters or reference spectra. The performance of AI-Binning is demonstrated using serum spectra from 40 hypertensive and 40 matched normotensive subjects from the Asklepios study. Hypertension is a major cardiovascular risk factor characterized by a complex biochemistry and, in most cases, an unknown origin. The binning algorithm resulted in an improved classification of hypertensive status compared with that of standard binning and facilitated the identification of relevant metabolites. Moreover, since the occurrence of noise variables is largely avoided, AI-Binned spectra can be unit-variance scaled. This enables the detection of relevant, low-intensity metabolites. These results demonstrate the power of AI-Binning and suggest the involvement of alpha-1 acid glycoproteins and choline biochemistry in hypertension.",

    "abstract": "Introduction:Little information is available on patients with adrenal insufficiency (AI) in regard to complaints before diagnosis, time until correct diagnosis, false diagnosis, and professional changes due to the diagnosis. Objective:We retrospectively evaluated circumstances before and at diagnosis of AI in patients with primary and secondary AI by using established Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, Short Form-36 and Giessen Complaint List (GBB-24) questionnaires, and a self-established general registration form. Methods:In this cross-sectional study, questionnaire sets were available from 216 patients (primary AI, n = 99; secondary AI, n = 117). Time duration before treatment, underlying diagnoses, and disease symptoms were verified by questionnaires and review of medical records. Results regarding subjective health status (SHS) were compared with sex- and age-matched controls drawn from questionnaire-specific reference cohorts. Results:Less than 30% of woman and 50% of men with AI were diagnosed within the first 6 months after onset of symptoms. Twenty percent of patients suffered >5 years before being diagnosed. More than 67% of patients consulted at least 3 physicians, and 68% were primarily false diagnosed. The most common false diagnoses were of psychiatric and gastrointestinal origin. Overall, patients with AI showed an impaired SHS compared with controls, and patients who were diagnosed correctly within 3 months showed a significantly better SHS. Conclusions:Because of the unspecific symptoms, diagnosis is often delayed, not recognized by physicians or diagnosed falsely. An early diagnosis is necessary and might positively influence SHS in patients with AI.",

    "title": "Effect of reducing the period of follicle dominance in a timed artificial insemination protocol on reproduction of dairy cows.",
    "abstract": "Objectives were to determine the effect of reducing the period of follicle dominance in a timed artificial insemination (AI) protocol on pregnancy per AI (P/AI) in Holstein cows. In experiment 1, 165 cows received 2 injections of PGF(2alpha) at 36 and 50 d in milk (DIM). At 61 DIM, cows were assigned randomly to Cosynch 72 h (CoS72: d 61 GnRH, d 68 PGF(2alpha), d 71 GnRH) or to a 5-d Cosynch 72 h with 1 (5dCoS1: d 61 GnRH, d 66 PGF(2alpha), d 69 GnRH) or 2 injections of PGF(2alpha) (5dCoS2: d 61 GnRH, d 66 and 67 PGF(2alpha), d 69 GnRH). Blood was sampled at the first GnRH, first PGF(2alpha), and at the second GnRH of the protocols and assayed for progesterone. Ovulatory responses to GnRH were evaluated by ultrasonography. Cows were considered synchronized if they had concentrations of progesterone >or=1 ng/mL and <1 ng/mL on the days of the PGF(2alpha), and the second GnRH of the protocols, respectively, and if they ovulated within 48 h of the second GnRH injection. In experiment 2, 933 cows were assigned randomly to CoS72 or 5dCoS2. Blood was assayed for progesterone and ovaries were scanned as in experiment 1. Plasma on the days of the first PGF(2alpha) and final GnRH of the timed AI protocols was assayed for estradiol in 75 cows. Pregnancy was diagnosed on d 38 and 66 after AI. In experiment 1, the proportions of cows with corpora lutea (CL) regression on the day of AI differed and were 79.0, 59.1, and 95.7% for CoS72, 5dCoS1, and 5dCoS2, respectively. Cows that ovulated to the first GnRH of the Cosynch tended to have lesser CL regression than cows that did not ovulate (73.0 vs. 86.4%). Protocol synchronization differed between treatments and they were greater for CoS72 (69.4%) and 5dCoS2 (78.4%) than for 5dCoS1 (42.3%). In experiment 2, CL regression was lesser (91.5 vs. 96.3%) but detection of estrus at timed AI (30.9 vs. 23.6%) was greater for CoS72 than 5dCoS2, and cows in estrus had increased P/AI (46.2 vs. 31.9%). Cows in CoS72 ovulated a larger follicle and had greater concentrations of estradiol on the day of AI than cows in 5dCoS2, but protocol synchronization tended to increase in cows receiving the 5dCoS2. When all 933 cows were evaluated, P/AI was greater for 5dCoS2 than for CoS72 (37.9 vs. 30.9%). Similarly, when only cows with progesterone <1 ng/mL on the day of AI were evaluated, P/AI was greater for 5dCoS2 than for CoS72 (39.3 vs. 33.9%). Treatment with PGF(2alpha) on d 5 and 6 after GnRH resulted in increased luteolysis and allowed for reducing the interval from GnRH to timed AI, which increased P/AI. Reducing time of follicle dominance in timed AI protocols improves fertility of lactating dairy cows.",

The AISS ranged from 4 to 107 overall and varied from 4 to 88 in the mildly injured group and 76 to 107 in the severe head injury group, supporting the concept that there is a spectrum of AI in traumatic head injury and that the AISS is a measure of the extent of AI. APP immunostaining demonstrated positive axonal swellings 1.75 h after head injury and analysis of the pattern of AI in the mild and severe head injury groups showed that axons were more vulnerable than blood vessels and that the axons in the corpus callosum and fornices were the most vulnerable of all.",

    "title": "Letter to the Editor: Research Priorities for Robust and Beneficial Artificial Intelligence: An Open Letter",
    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) research has explored a variety of problems and approaches since its inception, but for the last 20 years or so has been focused on the problems surrounding the construction of intelligent agents — systems that perceive and act in some environment. In this context, \"intelligence\" is related to statistical and economic notions of rationality — colloquially, the ability to make good decisions, plans, or inferences. The adoption of probabilistic and decision-theoretic representations and statistical learning methods has led to a large degree of integration and cross-fertilization among AI, machine learning, statistics, control theory, neuroscience, and other fields. The establishment of shared theoretical frameworks, combined with the availability of data and processing power, has yielded remarkable successes in various component tasks such as speech recognition, image classification, autonomous vehicles, machine translation, legged locomotion, and question-answering systems. As capabilities in these areas and others cross the threshold from laboratory research to economically valuable technologies, a virtuous cycle takes hold whereby even small improvements in performance are worth large sums of money, prompting greater investments in research. There is now a broad consensus that AI research is progressing steadily, and that its impact on society is likely to increase. The potential benefits are huge, since everything that civilization has to offer is a product of human intelligence; we cannot predict what we might achieve when this intelligence is magnified by the tools AI may provide, but the eradication of disease and poverty are not unfathomable. Because of the great potential of AI, it is important to research how to reap its benefits while avoiding potential pitfalls. The progress in AI research makes it timely to focus research not only on making AI more capable, but also on maximizing the societal benefit of AI. Such considerations motivated the AAAI 2008–09 Presidential Panel on Long-Term AI Futures and other projects on AI impacts, and constitute a significant expansion of the field of AI itself, which up to now has focused largely on techniques that are neutral with respect to purpose. We recommend expanded research aimed at ensuring that increasingly capable AI systems are robust and beneficial: our AI systems must do what we want them to do. The attached research priorities document [see page X] gives many examples of such research directions that can help maximize the societal benefit of AI. This research is by necessity interdisciplinary, because it involves both society and AI. It ranges from economics, law and philosophy to computer security, formal methods and, of course, various branches of AI itself. In summary, we believe that research on how to make AI systems robust and beneficial is both important and timely, and that there are concrete research directions that can be pursued today.",

    "title": "Reconsidering the rhizotoxicity of hydroxyl, sulphate, and fluoride complexes of aluminium",
    "abstract": "Recent years have witnessed some convergence of opinion regarding the identity of the rhizotoxic species of aluminium. AI04AI12(0H)24(H20)?2+ (AI13) and Al 3+ are almost certainly toxic, but no rhizotoxicity has been detected for AI-S04 (AISO4+ and AlfSOJj\") or Al-F (e.g. AIF2+ and AIF2+). The status of AI-OH (e.g. AIOH2+ and AI(OH)2+) is uncertain because experimental results often appear to indicate AI-OH toxicity. In this article it is argued that this appearance of toxicity is the consequence of the relief of Al3 + toxicity by H + (and vice versa). Furthermore, this view provides an explanation for phenomena, such as Al stimulation of growth, unexplained by the hypothesis that AI-OH is toxic. It is concluded, therefore, that AI-OH is not toxic at achievable activities. The previous failure to detect toxicity from AI-S04 and AI-F also may have been a consequence of the low activities used in the experiments. New experiments again failed to reveal a toxicity for AI-SO4, but do indicate that AIF2+ and AIF2+ are toxic. Several alternative hypotheses for the apparent toxicity of Al-F were considered and rejected. Consequently, this report concludes that the following Al species are toxic to wheat roots in the following order: AI 13 >AI 3+ >AIF 2+ > AIF 2 +. The correlation between toxicity and charge is discussed in light of the fact that the binding strength of cations to plasma membrane surfaces generally increases with charge.",

    "title": "Interactive drama, art and artificial intelligence",
    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence methods open up new possibilities in art and entertainment, enabling rich and deeply interactive experiences. At the same time as AI opens up new fields of artistic expression, AI-based art itself becomes a fundamental research agenda, posing and answering novel research questions that would not be raised unless doing AI research in the context of art and entertainment. I call this agenda, in which AI research and art mutually inform each other, Expressive AI. Expressive AI takes seriously the problem of building intelligences that robustly function outside of the lab, engaging human participants in intellectually and aesthetically satisfying interactions, which, hopefully, teach us something about ourselves. \nThis thesis describes a specific AI-based art piece, an interactive drama called Facade, and describes the practice of Expressive AI, using Facade, as well as additional AI-based artwork described in the appendices, as case studies. \nAn interactive drama is a dramatically interesting virtual world inhabited by computer-controlled characters, within which the player experiences a story from a first person perspective. Over the past decade, there has been a fair amount of research into believable agents, that is, autonomous characters exhibiting rich personalities, emotions, and social interactions. There has been comparatively little work, however, exploring how the local, reactive behavior of believable agents can be integrated with the more global, deliberative nature of a story plot, so as to build interactive, dramatic worlds. This thesis presents Facade, the first published interactive drama system that integrates character (believable agents), story (drama management) and shallow natural language processing into a complete system. Facade will be publicly released as a free download in 2003. \nIn the Facade architecture, the unit of plot/character integration is the dramatic beat. In the theory of dramatic writing, beats are the smallest unit of dramatic action, consisting of a short dialog exchange or small amount of physical action. As architectural entities, beats organize both the procedural knowledge to accomplish the beat's dramatic action, and the declarative knowledge to sequence the beat in an evolving plot. Instead of conceiving of the characters as strongly autonomous entities that coordinate to accomplish dramatic action through purely local decision-making, characters are instead weakly autonomous—the character's behavioral repertoire dynamically changes as beats are sequenced.

    "abstract": "We examined the effect of unilateral restricted cochlear lesions in adult cats on the topographic representations (“maps”) of the lesioned and unlesioned cochleas in the primary auditory cortex (AI) contralateral to the lesioned cochlea. Frequency (tonotopic) maps were derived by conventional multineuron mapping procedures in anesthetized animals. In confirmation of a study in adult guinea pigs (Robertson and Irvine [1989] J. Comp. Neurol. 282:456–471), we found that 2–11 months after the unilateral cochlear lesion the map of the lesioned cochlea in the contralateral AI was altered so that the AI region in which frequencies with lesion‐induced elevations in cochlear neural sensitivity would have been represented was occupied by an enlarged representation of lesion‐edge frequencies (i.e., frequencies adjacent to those with elevated cochlear neural sensitivity). Along the tonotopic axis of AI the total representation of lesion‐edge frequencies could extend up to ≈ 2.6 mm rostral to the area of normal representation of these frequencies. There was no topographic order within this enlarged representation. Examination of threshold sensitivity at the characteristic frequency (CF, frequency to which the neurons were most sensitive) in the reorganized regions of the map of the lesioned cochlea established that the changes in the map reflected a plastic reorganization rather than simply reflecting the residue of prelesion input.",

    "abstract": "Most research into applying AI techniques to real-time control problems has limited the power of AI methods or embedded reactivity in an AI system. An alternative, cooperative architecture is presented. It uses separate AI and real-time subsystems to address the problems for which each is designed. A structured interface allows the subsystems to communicate without compromising their respective performance goals. By reasoning about its own bounded reactivity, cooperative intelligent real-time control architecture (CIRCA) can guarantee that it will meet hard deadlines while still using unpredictable AI methods. With its abilities to guarantee or trade off the timeliness, precision, confidence, and completeness of its output, CIRCA provides more flexible performance than previous systems. >",

    "abstract": "Our objective was to validate a carotid artery tonometry-derived augmentation index as a means to estimate augmentation index (AI) of ascending aortic pressure under various physiological conditions. A total of 66 patients (50 men, 16 women; mean age, 55 years; range, 21 to 78 years; 44 in Taiwan and 22 in the United States) undergoing diagnostic catheterization were studied. Arterial pressure contours were obtained simultaneously from the right common carotid artery by applanation tonometry with an external micromanometer-tipped probe and from the ascending aorta by a micromanometer-tipped catheter at baseline (n = 62), after handgrip (n = 36), or after sublingual nitroglycerin administration (n = 17). The AI (expressed as percentage values) was calculated as the ratio of amplitude of the pressure wave above its systolic shoulder to the total pulse pressure. The carotid AI was consistently lower than the aortic AI, but the two were highly correlated at baseline and after both handgrip and nitroglycerin. Mean +/- SD and correlation coefficients were baseline (14 +/- 16, 28(+) +/- 17, .77), handgrip (18 +/- 19, 32(+) +/- 15, .86), and nitroglycerin (7 +/- 12, 18(+) +/- 13, .52). In addition, after adjusting for age, sex, height, blood pressure, heart rate, and study site, the changes of both AIs from baseline values with handgrip or nitroglycerin were highly associated such that the aortic AI could be approximated from the carotid AI with appropriate regression equations. The high correlations and predictable changes after interventions between the central AI and those estimated from noninvasive carotid tonometry suggest that this technique may have wide applicability for many cardiovascular studies.",

    "abstract": "Engineering and scientific education condition us to expect everything, including intelligence, to have a simple, compact explanation. Accordingly, when people new to AI ask \"What's AI all about,\" they seem to expect an answer that defines AI in terms of a few basic mathematical laws. Today, some researchers who seek a simple, compact explanation hope that systems modeled on neural nets or some other connectionist idea will quickly overtake more traditional systems based on symbol manipulation. Others believe that symbol manipulation, with a history that goes back millennia, remains the only viable approach. Marvin Minsky subscribes to neither of these extremist views. Instead, he argues that AI must use many approaches. AI is not like circuit theory and electromagnetism. There is nothing wonderfully unifying like Kirchhoff's laws are to circuit theory or Maxwell's equations are to electromagnetism. Instead of looking for a \"right way,\" the time has come to build systems out of diverse components, some connectionist and some symbolic, each with its own diverse justification.\" - Patrick Winston",

    "abstract": "The objective of this study was to estimate the effects of different types of clinical mastitis (CM) on the probability of conception in New York State Holstein cows. Data were available on 55,372 artificial inseminations (AI) in 23,695 lactations from 14,148 cows in 7 herds. We used generalized linear mixed models to model whether or not a cow conceived after a particular AI. Independent variables included AI number (first, second, third, fourth), parity, season when AI occurred, farm, type of CM (due to gram-positive bacteria, gram-negative bacteria, or other organisms) in the 6 wk before and after an AI, and occurrence of other diseases. Older cows were less likely to conceive. Inseminations occurring in the summer were least likely to be successful. Retained placenta decreased the probability of conception. Conception was also less likely with each successive AI. The probability of conception associated with the first AI was 0.29. The probability of conception decreased to 0.26, 0.25, and 0.24 for the second, third, and fourth AI, respectively. Clinical mastitis occurring any time between 14 d before until 35 d after an AI was associated with a lower probability of conception; the greatest effect was an 80% reduction associated with gram-negative CM occurring in the week after AI. In general, CM due to gram-negative bacteria had a more detrimental effect on probability of conception than did CM caused by gram-positive bacteria or other organisms. Furthermore, CM had more effect on probability of conception immediately around the time of AI. Additional information about CM (i.e., its timing with respect to AI, and whether the causative agent is gram-positive or gram-negative bacteria, or other organisms) is valuable to dairy personnel in determining why some cows are unable to conceive in a timely manner. These findings are also beneficial for the management of mastitic cows (especially those with gram-negative CM) when mastitis occurs close to AI.",

    "title": "Role of cat primary auditory cortex for sound-localization behavior.",
    "abstract": "Small lesions designed to completely destroy the cortical zone of representation of a restricted band of frequency were introduced within the primary auditory cortex (AI) in adult cats. Physiological mapping was used to guide placement of lesions. Sound-localization performance was evaluated prior to and after induction of these lesions in a seven-choice free-sound-field apparatus. All tested cats had profound contralateral hemifield deficits for the localization of brief tones at frequencies roughly corresponding to those whose representations were destroyed by the lesion. Sound-localization performance was normal at all other test frequencies. In a single adult cat, a massive lesion destroyed nearly all auditory cortex unilaterally, with only the representation of a narrow band of frequency within AI spared by the lesion. This cat had normal abilities for azimuthal sound localization across that frequency band but a profound contralateral deficit for the azimuthal localization of brief sounds at all other frequencies. Recorded sound-localization deficits were permanent. Localization of long-duration tones was not affected by a unilateral AI lesion. These studies indicate that, at least in cats, AI is necessary for normal binaural sound-localization behavior; among auditory cortical fields, AI is sufficient for normal binaural sound-localization behavior; sound-location representation is organized by frequency channel in the auditory forebrain; and AI in each hemisphere contributes to only contralateral free-sound-field location representation.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nChromosome 8 alterations, including loss of 8p21-22 and gain of 8q24, are commonly observed in prostate carcinoma. We examined whether these alterations are associated with poor prognosis in prostate cancer.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe used dual-probe fluorescence in situ hybridization and DNA probes for 8p22 (lipoprotein lipase gene), centromere 8 (8cen), and 8q24 (c-myc gene) to determine the corresponding copy numbers in tumor samples from 144 patients with high-grade, advanced (stage III) prostate carcinoma. Cox models were used for multivariate analysis of systemic progression or patient death from prostate cancer. All statistical tests are two-sided.\n\n\nRESULTS\nWe classified the 8p22, 8cen, and c-myc copy number as normal, loss, and gain. An additional increase (AI) category of c-myc relative to the centromere copy number (i.e., overrepresentation and amplification of c-myc) was also used. Alterations of 8p22 were not statistically significantly associated with either systemic progression or patient death. Alterations of c-myc were associated with both systemic progression (P =.024) and patient death (P =.039); AI of c-myc showed the poorest outcome. We also evaluated the prognostic relevance of the combined 8p22-8cen-c-myc loci anomaly pattern for the following six patterns: normal-normal-normal, loss-any 8cen-normal, loss-gain-gain, gain-gain-gain, non-loss-any 8cen-AI, and loss-any 8cen-AI, where any 8cen is normal, loss, or gain of the chromosome 8 centromere. Patients with the loss-any 8cen-AI pattern had earlier systemic progression (P =.009) and earlier cause-specific death (P =.013) than did patients with other patterns. Multivariate analyses demonstrated that the loss-any 8cen-AI pattern was an independent risk factor for systemic progression (P<.001) and cause-specific death (P =.002).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nGenetic alterations of chromosome 8 appear to accumulate in parallel with the progression of prostate carcinomas. AI of the c-myc gene, especially with loss of 8p22, appears to be associated with poor patient prognosis.",

    "abstract": "The objectives of this study were to evaluate the effects of an intravaginal insert containing progesterone (CIDR, controlled internal drug releasing) administered in presynchronization and resynchronization protocols on cyclicity, detection of estrus, pregnancy rate, and pregnancy loss to first AI; reinsemination patterns; and pregnancy rates to second postpartum AI before and after the time of first-service pregnancy diagnosis in dairy cows. Holstein cows (n = 1,052) were blocked by parity and BCS at 3 +/- 3 d in milk (study d 0 = day of calving) and assigned randomly to 1 of 3 presynchronization treatments. During the presynchronization programs, all cows received 2 injections of PGF2alpha, on study d 35 and 49. Cows enrolled in the control presynchronization treatment received AI after detected estrus from study d 49 to 62. Cows enrolled in the CIDR estrus-detection (CED) presynchronization treatment received a CIDR insert from study d 42 to 49 and AI on detection of estrus from d 49 to 62. Cows enrolled in the CIDR timed AI (CTAI) presynchronization treatment received the same treatment as CED, but were subjected to timed AI on study d 72 after the Ovsynch (GnRH, 7 d PGF2alpha, 2 d GnRH, 24 h timed AI) protocol. The control and CED cows not inseminated by study d 62 were enrolled in the Ovsynch protocol on the same day and received timed AI on study d 72. After first AI, cows were assigned to no resynchronization (RCON) or resynchronization with a CIDR insert (RCIDR) between 14 and 21 d after AI. Blood samples collected on study d 35, 49, and 62 were analyzed for concentrations of progesterone and cows were classified as anestrous when progesterone was < 1.0 ng/mL in the first 2 samples. On study d 62, anestrous cows with progesterone > or = 1.0 ng/mL were classified as having resumed cyclicity. Pregnancy was diagnosed at 31 and 60 d after first AI and at 42 d after second AI. A greater proportion of anestrous cows in CED and CTAI became cyclic by d 62 postpartum than control cows. Resynchronization with the CIDR insert increased the pregnancy rate at 31 d after first AI in CED and CTAI, and at 60 d after AI in all cows because of reduced pregnancy loss. These results indicate that presynchronization with the CIDR insert increased induction of cyclicity in anestrous cows and that resynchronization with the CIDR insert did not affect the reinsemination rate but did reduce pregnancy loss and increased the pregnancy rate at 60 d after first AI.",

    "abstract": "The objectives were to evaluate effects of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) (3,300 IU i.m.) administered on d 5 after AI on CL number, plasma progesterone concentration, conception rate, and pregnancy loss in high-producing dairy cows. Following the synchronization of estrus and AI, 406 cows were injected with either hCG or saline on d 5 after AI in a randomized complete block design. Blood sampling and ovarian ultrasonography were conducted once between d 11 and 16 after AI. Pregnancy diagnoses were performed on d 28 by ultrasonography and on d 45 and 90 after AI by rectal palpation. Treatment with hCG on d 5 resulted in 86.2% of the cows with more than one CL compared with 23.2% in controls. Plasma progesterone concentrations were increased by 5.0 ng/mL in hCG-treated cows. The presence of more than one CL increased progesterone concentration in hCG-treated cows but not in controls. Conception rates were higher for hCG-treated cows on d 28 (45.8 > 38.7%), 45 (40.4 > 36.3%), and 90 (38.4 > 31.9%) after AI. Treatment with hCG improved conception rate in cows losing body condition between AI and d 28 after Al. Pregnancy losses were similar between treatment groups. Treatment with hCG on d 5 after AI induces accessory CL, enhances plasma progesterone concentration, and improves conception rate of high-producing dairy cows.",

Cows detected in estrus (n = 387) between 48 and 96 h after the PGF2alpha injection received AI (n = 227) 12 h after detection of estrus or ET (n = 160) 6 to 8 d later (1 fresh embryo, grade 1 or 2, produced from nonlactating cows). Pregnancy was diagnosed at 28 and 42 d after estrus, and embryonic loss occurred when a cow was pregnant on d 28 but not pregnant on d 42. Ovulation, conception, and embryonic loss were analyzed by a logistic model to evaluate the effects of covariates [days in milk (DIM), milk yield, body temperature (BT) at d 7 and 14 post-AI, and serum concentration of progesterone (P4) at d 7 and 14 post-AI] on the probability of success. The first analysis included all cows that were detected in estrus. The CR of AI and ET were different on d 28 (AI, 32.6% vs. ET, 49.4%) and 42 (AI, 29.1% vs. ET, 38.8%) and were negatively influenced by high BT (d 7) and DIM. The second analysis included only cows with a corpus luteum on d 7. Ovulation rate was 84.8% and was only negatively affected by DIM. Conception rates of AI and ET were different on d 28 (AI, 37.9% vs. ET, 59.4%) and 42 (AI, 33.8% vs. ET, 46.6%) and were negatively influenced by high BT (d 7). The third analysis included only ovulating cows that were 7 d postestrus. Conception rates of AI and ET were different on d 28 (AI, 37.5% vs. ET, 63.2%) and 42 (AI, 31.7% vs. ET, 51.7%) and were negatively influenced by high BT (d 7). There was a positive effect of serum concentration of P4 and a negative effect of milk production on the probability of conception for the AI group but not for the ET group. The fourth analysis was embryonic loss (AI, 10.8% vs. ET, 21.5%). The transfer of fresh embryos is an important tool to increase the probability of conception of lactating Holstein cows because it can bypass the negative effects of milk production and low P4 on the early embryo. The superiority of ET vs. AI is more evident in high-producing cows. High BT measured on d 7 had a negative effect on CR and embryonic retention.",

    "title": "Differential gene expression shows natural brominated furanones interfere with the autoinducer-2 bacterial signaling system of Escherichia coli.",
    "abstract": "The quorum sensing disrupter (5Z)-4-bromo-5-(bromomethylene)-3-butyl-2(5H)-furanone (furanone) of the alga Delisea pulchra was previously found by us (Environ Microbiol 3:731-736, 2001) to inhibit quorum sensing in Escherichia coli via autoinducer-2 (AI-2, produced by LuxS). In this study, DNA microarrays were used to study the genetic basis of this natural furanone inhibition of AI-2 signaling (significant values with p < 0.05 are reported). Using DNA microarrays, the AI-2 mutant Escherichia coli DH5alpha was compared with the AI-2 wild-type strain, E. coli K12, to determine how AI-2 influenced gene expression. Escherichia coli K12 was also grown with 0 and 60 microg/mL furanone to study the inhibition of quorum sensing gene expression. It was found that 166 genes were differentially expressed by AI-2 (67 were induced and 99 were repressed) and 90 genes were differentially expressed by furanone (34 were induced and 56 were repressed). Importantly, 79% (44 out of 56) of the genes repressed by furanone were induced by AI-2, which indicated that furanone inhibited AI-2 signaling and influenced the same suite of genes as a regulon. Most of these genes have functions of chemotaxis, motility, and flagellar synthesis. Interestingly, the aerotaxis genes aer and tsr were discovered to be induced by AI-2 and repressed by furanone. Representative microarray results were confirmed by RNA dot blotting. Furthermore, the E. coli air-liquid interface biofilm formation was repressed by furanone, supporting the results that taxis and flagellar genes were repressed by furanone. The autoinducer bioassay indicated that 100 microg/mL furanone decreased the extracellular concentration of AI-2 2-fold, yet luxS and pfs transcription were not significantly altered. Hence, furanone appeared to alter AI-2 signaling post-transcriptionally.",

    "title": "Surveillance for health behaviors of American Indians and Alaska Natives. Findings from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, 1997-2000.",
    "abstract": "PROBLEM/CONDITION\nIn the United States, disparities in risks for chronic disease (e.g., diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and cancer) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) are evident among American Indians and Alaska Natives (AI/ANs) and other groups. This report summarizes findings from the 1997-2000 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) for health-status indicators, health-risk behaviors, and HIV testing and perceived risk for HIV infection among AI/ANs, compared with other racial/ethnic groups in five regions of the United States.\n\n\nREPORTING PERIOD COVERED\n1997-2000.\n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF SYSTEM\nBRFSS is a state-based telephone survey of the civilian, noninstitutionalized, adult (i.e., persons aged > or =18 years) population. For this report, responses from the 36 states covered by the Indian Health Service administrative areas were analyzed.\n\n\nRESULTS\nRegion and sex-specific variations occurred in the prevalence of high-risk behaviors and health-status indicators. For example, the prevalence of current cigarette smoking ranged from 21.2% in the Southwest to 44.1% in the Northern Plains, and the awareness of diabetes was lower in Alaska than in other regions. Men were more likely than women to report binge drinking and drinking and driving. For the majority of health behaviors and status measures, AI/ANs were more likely than respondents of other racial/ethnic groups to be at increased risk. For example, AI/ANs were more likely than respondents of other racial/ethnic groups to report obesity (23.9% versus 18.7%) and no leisure-time physical activity (32.5% versus 27.5%).\n\n\nINTERPRETATION\nThe 1997-2000 BRFSS data demonstrate that health behaviors vary regionally among AI/ANs and by sex. The data also reveal disparities in health behaviors between AI/ANs and other racial/ethnic groups. The reasons for these differences by region and sex, and for the racial/ethnic disparities, are subjects for further study. However, such patterns should be monitored through continued surveillance, and the data should be used to guide prevention and research activities. For example, states with substantial AI/AN populations, and certain tribes, have successfully used BRFSS data to develop and monitor diabetes and tobacco prevention and control programs.\n\n\nPUBLIC HEALTH ACTIONS\nFederal and state agencies, tribes, Indian health boards, and urban Indian health centers will continue to use BRFSS data to develop and guide public health programs and policies. The BRFSS data will also be used to monitor progress in eliminating racial and ethnic health disparities. Regional Indian health boards, tribal epidemiology centers, and Indian Health Service Area Offices can use the findings of this report to prioritize interventions to prevent specific health problems in their geographic areas. Moreover, tribes and other institutions that promote AI/AN health care can use the report to document health needs when applying for resources.",

    "abstract": "We investigated whether there was a correlation between the simultaneous assessments of augmentation index (AI) and pulse wave velocity (PWV), undertaken by the SphygmoCor system, and what were the principal factors responsible for differences in these two putative assessments of arterial stiffness, in 105 offspring (41 men, 64 women) aged 19-71 years, of patients with familial hypertension. Arterial stiffness was measured using the SphygmoCor pulse wave analysis system. AI and PWV correlated significantly and positively (r = 0.29, p < 0.005) and the strength of the correlation was greater when each gender was examined separately. This led us to observe several-fold higher AI in women (22.04 +/- 12) than in men (8.59 +/- 13) (p < 0.001); the difference could be explained only in part by an inverse regression correlation between AI and height (r = -0.45; p < 0.001), but not PWV. AI was also more influenced than PWV by heart rate and blood pressure. AI is strongly correlated with a previously validated estimate of arterial stiffness, PWV. It is probable that separate normal ranges should be established for men and women, while further studies determine what parameters other than height are responsible for the gender difference.",

    "title": "Redefining the tonotopic core of rat auditory cortex: Physiological evidence for a posterior field",
    "abstract": "Previous physiological studies have identified a tonotopically organized primary auditory cortical field (AI) in the rat. Some of this prior research suggests that the rat, like other mammals, may have additional fields surrounding AI. We, therefore, recorded in the Sprague‐Dawley rat extracellular responses of single neurons throughout AI, and continued posteriorly to verify the existence of a posterior field (P) and to compare the neuronal properties in the two regions. Acoustic stimuli, including tones, bandpass noise, broadband noise, and temporally modulated stimuli, were delivered dichotically via sealed systems. Consistent with previous findings, AI was characterized by an anterior‐to‐posterior tonotopic progression from high to low frequencies (ranging from >40 kHz to <1 kHz). A frequency reversal at the posterior border of AI marked entry into a second core tonotopic region, P, with progressively higher frequencies encountered further posteriorly, up to a point (approximately 8 kHz) where cells were no longer tone responsive. Nevertheless, bandpass noise was an effective stimulus in P, enabling characterization of cells up to 15 kHz. Compared with AI, the frequency tuning of response areas was relatively broader in P, the response latency was often longer and more variable, and the response magnitude was more commonly a nonmonotonic function of stimulus level. In both fields, most neurons were binaurally influenced. The presence of multiple auditory cortical fields in the rat is consistent with auditory cortical organization in other mammals. Moreover, the response properties of P relative to AI in the rat also resemble those found in other mammals. Finally, the physiological data suggest that core auditory cortex (temporal area TE1) is composed not only of AI as previously thought, but also of at least two other subdivisions, P and an anterior field (A). Furthermore, our physiological characterization of TE1 reveals that it is larger than suggested by previous anatomical characterizations. J. Comp. Neurol. 453:345–360, 2002. © 2002 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nAmelogenesis imperfecta (AI) is a hereditary dental condition with poor esthetics and dental sensitivity that frequently requires extensive dental treatment. The authors hypothesized that AI is associated with a negative psychosocial outcome.\n\n\nMETHODS\nFamily members with and without AI completed a questionnaire including demographic and dental history questions, as well as a number of psychometric scales. The authors investigated the effects of AI status (with versus without), sex and age on each of the psychosocial outcomes using a generalized linear model.\n\n\nRESULTS\nSubjects with AI (n = 30) had higher levels of social avoidance and distress, as well as higher levels of dysfunction, discomfort and disability attributable to their oral condition compared with subjects without AI (n = 29). The relationship of AI status to fear of negative evaluation, mastery and self-esteem was age-dependent. Younger subjects with AI tended to have higher fear of negative evaluation scores, while older subjects without AI tended to have higher fear of negative evaluation scores. Additionally, subjects without AI showed a definite decrease in mastery and self-esteem scores with age, while subjects with AI tended to show an increase in mastery and self-esteem scores with age.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThese results indicate that having AI has a marked impact on the psychosocial health of affected people comparable with the impact of systemic health conditions, especially at younger ages.\n\n\nCLINICAL IMPLICATIONS\nDental coverage for AI traditionally is excluded by third-party payers as being solely for esthetic reasons. The authors' study shows that AI has marked psychosocial effects, which suggests that dental treatment could be medically necessary and has far-reaching implications for the affected person's overall health.",

    "title": "Alan Turing and the development of Artificial Intelligence",
    "abstract": "During the centennial year of his birth Alan Turing 1912--1954 has been widely celebrated as having laid the foundations for Computer Science, Automated Decryption, Systems Biology and the Turing Test. In this paper we investigate Turing's motivations and expectations for the development of Machine Intelligence, as expressed in his 1950 article in Mind. We show that many of the trends and developments within AI over the last 50 years were foreseen in this foundational paper. In particular, Turing not only describes the use of Computational Logic but also the necessity for the development of Machine Learning in order to achieve human-level AI within a 50 year time-frame. His description of the Child Machine a machine which learns like an infant dominates the closing section of the paper, in which he provides suggestions for how AI might be achieved. Turing discusses three alternative suggestions which can be characterised as: 1 AI by programming, 2 AI by ab initio machine learning and 3 AI using logic, probabilities, learning and background knowledge. He argues that there are inevitable limitations in the first two approaches and recommends the third as the most promising. We compare Turing's three alternatives to developments within AI, and conclude with a discussion of some of the unresolved challenges he posed within the paper.",

    "abstract": "In this article, principles involving the intrinsic, deictic, and extrinsic use of spatial prepositions are examined from linguistic, psychological, and AI approaches. First, I define some important terms. Second, those prepositions which permit intrinsic, deictic, and extrinsic use are specified. Third, I examine how the frame of reference is determined for all three cases. Fourth, I look at ambiguities in the use of prepositions and how they can be resolved. Finally, I introduce the natural language dialog system CITYTOUR, which can cope with the intrinsic, deictic, and extrinsic use of spatial prepositions, and compare it with the approaches dealt with in the previous sections as well as to some other AI systems.",

The main objective of this paper is to present an overview of AI techniques for modelling, prediction and forecasting of solar radiation data. Published literature works presented in this paper show the potential of AI as a design tool for prediction and forecasting of solar radiation data; additionally, they present the advantages of using AI-based prediction solar radiation data in isolated areas where there no instrument for the measurement of this data, especially the parameters related to photovoltaic (PV) systems. Solar radiation plays a very important factor in PV-system performance and sizing.",

    "title": "Phosphorylation and processing of the quorum-sensing molecule autoinducer-2 in enteric bacteria.",
    "abstract": "Quorum sensing is a process of chemical communication that bacteria use to assess cell population density and synchronize behavior on a community-wide scale. Communication is mediated by signal molecules called autoinducers. The LuxS autoinducer synthase produces 4,5-dihydroxy-2,3-pentanedione (DPD), the precursor to a set of interconverting molecules that are generically called autoinducer-2 (AI-2). In enteric bacteria, AI-2 production induces the assembly of a transport apparatus (called the LuxS regulated (Lsr) transporter) that internalizes endogenously produced AI-2 as well as AI-2 produced by other bacterial species. AI-2 internalization is proposed to be a mechanism enteric bacteria employ to interfere with the signaling capabilities of neighboring species of bacteria. We have previously shown that Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium binds a specific cyclic derivative of DPD. Here we show that following internalization, the kinase LsrK phosphorylates carbon-5 of the open form of DPD. Phosphorylated DPD (P-DPD) binds specifically to the repressor of the lsr operon, LsrR, consistent with P-DPD being the inducer of the lsr operon. Subsequently, LsrG catalyzes the cleavage of P-DPD producing 2-phosphoglycolic acid. This series of chemical events is proposed to enable enteric bacteria to respond to the presence of competitor bacteria by sequestering and destroying AI-2, thereby eliminating the competitors' intercellular communication capabilities.",

    "title": "Evaluating Appreciative Inquiry: A Relational Constructionist Perspective",
    "abstract": "Appreciative inquiry (AI) has become increasingly popular as a social constructionist approach to organizational change and development. Many claims are made about its status and value but there are few published evaluation studies. Furthermore, some interesting and important issues arise as to how AI can be evaluated appropriately – given its social constructionist context. The heart of our argument is that AI could appropriately and usefully be evaluated using the approach of ‘responsive evaluation’. We lay out our views by putting forward a particular, relational, narrative of social construction processes. We then draw upon this relational narrative to develop three themes. One theme is that both AI and social constructionism should be viewed as variable social constructions and not fixed ‘things’. This means that AI manifests in many different ways in different local-cultural and local-historical contexts. 1 A related theme is that, if theory and method co-define one another, then AI is much more than just a method. Finally, viewing evaluation as a variable social construction suggests that some evaluation practices will be more consistent with the premises of relational constructionism and AI than others. These themes are developed in several parts. In the first, we briefly introduce AI, the links that have been made between it and social constructionism, and potential implications of these links for evaluation. In the second, we outline the defining premises of relational constructionism. In the third, we examine AI, its multiple meanings, and its central premises. We then explore links between relational constructionism and AI. This brings us to the fifth part in which we introduce evaluation and its potential relations with AI. Finally, we write of how AI and evaluation could be performed in ways that reflect relational constructionist premises.",

    "abstract": "ObjectiveTo review the history and current applications of artificial intelligence in the intensive care unit. Data SourcesThe MEDLINE database, bibliographies of selected articles, and current texts on the subject. Study SelectionThe studies that were selected for review used artificial intelligence tools for a variety of intensive care applications, including direct patient care and retrospective database analysis. Data ExtractionAll literature relevant to the topic was reviewed. Data SynthesisAlthough some of the earliest artificial intelligence (AI) applications were medically oriented, AI has not been widely accepted in medicine. Despite this, patient demographic, clinical, and billing data are increasingly available in an electronic format and therefore susceptible to analysis by intelligent software. Individual AI tools are specifically suited to different tasks, such as waveform analysis or device control. ConclusionsThe intensive care environment is particularly suited to the implementation of AI tools because of the wealth of available data and the inherent opportunities for increased efficiency in inpatient care. A variety of new AI tools have become available in recent years that can function as intelligent assistants to clinicians, constantly monitoring electronic data streams for important trends, or adjusting the settings of bedside devices. The integration of these tools into the intensive care unit can be expected to reduce costs and improve patient outcomes.",

    "title": "Arti ﬁ cial Intelligence and Machine Learning in Radiology: Opportunities, Challenges, Pitfalls, and Criteria for Success",
    "abstract": "Worldwide interest in arti ﬁ cial intelligence (AI) applications, including imaging, is high and growing rapidly, fueled by availability of large datasets ( “ big data ” ), substantial advances in computing power, and new deep-learning algorithms. Apart from developing new AI methods per se, there are many opportunities and challenges for the imaging community, including the development of a common nomenclature, better ways to share image data, and standards for validating AI program use across different imaging platforms and patient populations. AI surveillance programs may help radiologists prioritize work lists by identifying suspicious or positive cases for early review. AI programs can be used to extract “ radiomic ” information from images not discernible by visual inspection, potentially increasing the diagnostic and prognostic value derived from image datasets. Predictions have been made that suggest AI will put radiologists out of business. This issue has been overstated, and it is much more likely that radiologists will bene ﬁ cially incorporate AImethods into their practices. Current limitations in availability of technical expertise and even computing power will be resolved over time and can also be addressed by remote access solutions. Success for AI in imaging will be measured by value created: increased diagnostic certainty, faster turnaround, better outcomes for patients, and better quality of work life for radiologists. AI offers a new and promising set of methods for analyzing image data. Radiologists will explore these new pathways and are likely to play a leading role in medical applications of AI.",

    "abstract": "Amelogenesis imperfecta (AI) is a group of inherited defects of dental enamel formation that shows both clinical and genetic heterogeneity. To date, mutations in the gene encoding amelogenin have been shown to underlie a subset of the X-linked recessive forms of AI. Although none of the genes underlying autosomal-dominant or autosomal-recessive AI have been identified, a locus for a local hypoplastic form has been mapped to human chromosome 4q11-q21. In the current investigation, we have analysed a family with an autosomal-dominant, smooth hypoplastic form of AI. Our results have shown that a splicing mutation in the splice donor site of intron 7 of the gene encoding the enamel-specific protein enamelin underlies the phenotype observed in this family. This is the first autosomal-dominant form of AI for which the genetic mutation has been identified. As this type of AI is clinically distinct from that localized previously to chromosome 4q11-q21, these findings highlight the need for a molecular classification of this group of disorders.",

    "title": "Sources and terminations of callosal axons related to binaural and frequency maps in primary auditory cortex of the cat",
    "abstract": "The distributions of sources and terminals of callosal fibers in the high‐frequency representation of AI were related to binaural and frequency maps in combined anatomical and electrophysiological experiments. Sources of callosal axons were retrogradely labeled with HRP. Distributions of axon terminals were determined by autoradiographic labelling with [3H]‐proline and anterograde degeneration following callosal section. Regions in which cells exhibit summation or ipsilateral dominance and suppression contain higher concentrations of sources and terminals of callosal fibers than do regions in which cells exhibit monaural contralateral responses or contralateral dominance and suppression. Callosal axon terminals aggregate into columns. In Sections cut parallel to the cortical surface callosal columns take on complex forms that exhibit certain consistent features. Two prominent elongated columns separated by a narrow zone of sparse callosal innervation run in a rostrodorsal to caudoventral direction through AI crossing several octaves of the frequency representation. Ventral to these columns, along the AI‐AII border, less densely labeled callosal columns are in evidence. Low frequency representations of AI are interconnected but details of their innervation patterns were not worked out. Outside of AI there are regions that contain complex configurations of callosal columns. Several morphologically distinct types of neurons, located in laminae III through VI, were retrogradely labeled following injections of HRP into the opposite AI. About 94% of callosal neurons are pyramidal cells of layers III and IV.",

    "abstract": "An experiment compared the effectiveness of a timed AI and an AI at observed estrus. Lactating dairy cows were injected with PGF2 alpha at 30 +/- a range of 3 d postpartum, with a GnRH agonist at 65 +/- a range of 3 d, and with PGF2 alpha 7 d later; control cows (n = 128) were inseminated at detected estrus, but cows in the timed AI group (n = 171) received a second injection of GnRH agonist 48 h after the injection of PGF2 alpha and were inseminated 16 h later. Control cows that were not inseminated within 7 d were resynchronized with GnRH agonist, followed 7 d later with an injection of PGF2 alpha. Pregnancy rate was 30.5% for control cows and 29.0% for cows in the timed AI group, and conception rate was 41.5% for control cows and 26.5% for cows in the timed AI group. Days open for cows that conceived by 120 d postpartum was 83.6 d for control cows and 79.2 d for cows in the timed AI group. Treatment by month interactions indicated that pregnancy and conception rates and days open for cows that conceived were more consistent across months for cows in the timed AI group. Differences (control vs. timed AI) were not detected for overall pregnancy rate by 120 d postpartum (58.8 +/- 4.7% vs. 56.2 +/- 4.4%). Conception and pregnancy rates at first synchronization were influenced positively by body condition and plasma concentrations of progesterone at 65 d postpartum. Timed AI was an effective alternative for reproductive management.",

    "title": "AinS and a new family of autoinducer synthesis proteins",
    "abstract": "In Vibrio fischeri, the autoinducer N-3-oxohexanoyl-L-homoserine lactone (AI-1) governs the cell density-dependent induction of the luminescence operon via the LuxR transcriptional activator. The synthesis of AI-1 from bacterial metabolic intermediates is dependent on luxI. Recently, we found a second V. fischeri autoinducer molecule, N-octanoyl-L-homoserine lactone (AI-2), that in E. coli also activates the luminescence operon via LuxR. A locus independent of luxI was identified as being required for AI-2 synthesis. This 2.7-kb ain (autoinducer) locus was characterized by transposon insertion mutagenesis, deletion and complementation analysis, and DNA sequencing. A single 1,185-bp gene, ainS, was found to be the sole exogenous gene necessary for the synthesis of AI-2 in Escherichia coli. In addition, a V. fischeri ainS mutant produced AI-1 but not AI-2, confirming that in its native species ainS is specific for the synthesis of AI-2. ainS is predicted to encode a 45,580-Da protein which exhibits no similarity to LuxI or to any of the LuxI homologs responsible for the synthesis of N-acyl-L-homoserine lactones in a variety of other bacteria. The existence of two different and unrelated autoinducer synthesis genes suggests the occurrence of convergent evolution in the synthesis of homoserine lactone signaling molecules. The C-terminal half of AinS shows homology to a putative protein in Vibrio harveyi, LuxM, which is required for the synthesis of a V. harveyi bioluminescence autoinducer. Together, AinS and LuxM define a new family of autoinducer synthesis proteins. Furthermore, the predicted product of another gene, ainR, encoded immediately downstream of ainS, shows homology to LuxN, which is similarly encoded downstream of luxM in V. harveyi and proposed to have sensor/regulator functions in the bioluminescence response to the V. harveyi auto inducer. This similarity presents the possibility that AI-2, besides interacting with LuxR, also interacts with AinR under presently unknown conditions.",

    "title": "Diastolic stiffness and myocardial structure in aortic valve disease before and after valve replacement.",
    "abstract": "Passive diastolic properties were determined in 10 control patients and 21 patients with aortic valve disease before and 17.5 months after successful valve replacement. Ten patients had severe aortic stenoses (AS), five had combined aortic valve lesions (AS + aortic insufficiency [AI]), and six patients had severe AI. Left ventricular endomyocardial biopsies were obtained before and after surgery in patients with AS, AS + AI, and AI. Simultaneous echocardiographic and high-fidelity pressure measurements were made in all patients, and left ventricular chamber stiffness was calculated from a viscoelastic pressure-circumference relationship and left ventricular myocardial stiffness from a viscoelastic stress-strain relationship. The constant of chamber stiffness, beta', was slightly although not significantly increased in patients with AS (0.27 before and 0.24 after surgery), but was normal in those with AS + AI (0.22 before and 0.17 after surgery) and slightly decreased in those with AI (0.18 before and 0.16 after surgery) when compared with in control subjects (0.21). The constant of myocardial stiffness beta was normal in patients with AS (13.2), AS + AI (11.5), and AI (11.7) before surgery compared with in the control group (12.5). beta increased, however, significantly in those with AS (25.2; p less than .02), but not in those with AS + AI (16.3; NS) and AI (12.8; NS) after surgery. Myocardial morphologic characteristics showed a significant decrease in muscle fiber diameter in patients with AS, AS + AI, and AI, as well as a significant increase in interstitial fibrosis from 15% to 26% (p less than .05) in those with AS and a slight increase from 15% to 22% (NS) in those with AS + AI and from 19% to 24% (NS) in those with AI. Left ventricular fibrous content (left ventricular muscle mass index multiplied by interstitial fibrosis) remained, however, unchanged in all three groups after aortic valve replacement. In conclusion, left ventricular chamber stiffness is increased in AS but decreased in AI, whereas LV myocardial stiffness is normal in patients with aortic valve disease before surgery. After surgery, left ventricular myocardial stiffness increased significantly in AS patients but remained unchanged in those with AI. Postoperative changes in myocardial structure were characterized by a decrease in muscle fiber diameter and a relative increase in interstitial fibrosis, whereas fibrous content remained unchanged. Thus, regression of myocardial hypertrophy in aortic valve disease is accompanied by an increase of myocardial stiffness in concentric hypertrophy that is not seen in eccentric hypertrophy.",

The aim is to design AI planners for environments where there might be incomplete or faulty information, where actions might not always have the same results, and where there might be tradeoffs between the different possible outcomes of a plan. Addressing uncertainty in AI, planning algorithms will greatly increase the range of potential applications, but there is plenty of work to be done before we see practical decision-theoretic planning systems. This article outlines some of the challenges that need to be overcome and surveys some of the recent work in the area.",

    "title": "Is augmentation index a good measure of vascular stiffness in the elderly?",
    "abstract": "OBJECTIVES\nwe investigated the exact relationship between age and gender on augmentation pressure (AG) and augmentation index (AI) measured over the radial (muscular) and carotid (elastic) arteries.\n\n\nDESIGN AND METHODS\nAG is the contribution that wave reflection makes to systolic arterial pressure. AI is an indirect measure of arterial stiffness and is calculated as AG divided by pulse pressure (PP) x100. AG and AI both increase with age. AG and AI were measured in 458 subjects using SphygmoCor. A total of 755 readings were obtained (302 carotid, 453 radial). The mean age was 57.5 +/- 13.7 years. Diabetic subjects were excluded. Among the subjects, 13.5% were hypertensive.\n\n\nRESULTS\nstatistically, women had mean values of AI significantly higher than men in both radial and carotid arteries. These differences were less marked with AG. Quadratic equations better described the relationship between AI and age but not AG and age. Thus, AI increased with age up to our median age of 55 years but plateaued thereafter, whereas the AG continued to increase steadily with age. A multiple regression analysis demonstrated that both AI and AG were negatively related to height and positively related to diastolic blood pressure (DBP).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nAG continues to increase in the elderly over the age of 55, but not AI. AI is higher in women and higher when measured over the carotid than the radial. AI is positively related to DBP and negatively to height. AG is proposed as a more suitable measure of arterial stiffness than AI.",

    "title": "Applications of Artiﬁcial Intelligence in Transport: An Overview",
    "abstract": ": The rapid pace of developments in Artiﬁcial Intelligence (AI) is providing unprecedented opportunities to enhance the performance of different industries and businesses, including the transport sector. The innovations introduced by AI include highly advanced computational methods that mimic the way the human brain works. The application of AI in the transport ﬁeld is aimed at overcoming the challenges of an increasing travel demand, CO 2 emissions, safety concerns, and environmental degradation. In light of the availability of a huge amount of quantitative and qualitative data and AI in this digital age, addressing these concerns in a more efﬁcient and effective fashion has become more plausible. Examples of AI methods that are ﬁnding their way to the transport ﬁeld include Artiﬁcial Neural Networks (ANN), Genetic algorithms (GA), Simulated Annealing (SA), Artiﬁcial Immune system (AIS), Ant Colony Optimiser (ACO) and Bee Colony Optimization (BCO) and Fuzzy Logic Model (FLM) The successful application of AI requires a good understanding of the relationships between AI and data on one hand, and transportation system characteristics and variables on the other hand. Moreover, it is promising for transport authorities to determine the way to use these technologies to create a rapid improvement in relieving congestion, making travel time more reliable to their customers and improve the economics and productivity of their vital assets. This paper provides an overview of the AI techniques applied worldwide to address transportation problems mainly in trafﬁc management, trafﬁc safety, public transportation, and urban mobility. The overview concludes by addressing the challenges and limitations of AI applications in transport.",

In Experiment 2, 227 Holstein cows were assigned randomly to two treatments: 1) GnRH injection followed in 7 d by PGF2 alpha injection, then another GnRH injection 48 h later, and AI 16 to 18 h after the second GnRH injection; and 2) GnRH injection followed in 7 d by PGF2 alpha injection and AI only after detected estrus. Although conception rates in both experiments resulting from AI made after detected estrus either tended to be greater or were consistently greater than those following GnRH injection and one fixed-time AI, pregnancy rates were of greater magnitude after fixed-time AI because of poor expression or detection of estrus.",

    "title": "First-spike timing of auditory-nerve fibers and comparison with auditory cortex.",
    "abstract": "First-spike timing of auditory-nerve fibers and comparison with auditory cortex. J. Neurophysiol. 78: 2438-2454, 1997. The timing of the first spike of cat auditory-nerve (AN) fibers in response to onsets of characteristic frequency (CF) tone bursts was studied and compared with that of neurons in primary auditory cortex (AI), reported previously. Tones were shaped with cosine-squared rise functions, and rise time and sound pressure level were parametrically varied. Although measurement of first-spike latency of AN fibers was somewhat compromised by effects of spontaneous activity, latency was an invariant and inverse function of the maximum acceleration of peak pressure (i.e., a feature of the 2nd derivative of the stimulus envelope), as previously found in AI, rather than of tone level or rise time. Latency-acceleration functions of all AN fibers were of very similar shape, similar to that observed in AI. As in AI, latency-acceleration functions of different fibers were displaced along the latency axis, reflecting differences in minimum latency, and along the acceleration axis, reflecting differences in sensitivity to acceleration [neuronal transient sensitivity (S)]. S estimates increased with spontaneous rate (SR), but values of high-SR fibers exceeded those in AI. This suggests that S estimates are biased by SR per se, and that unbiased true S values would be less tightly correlated with response properties covarying with SR, such as firing threshold. S estimates varied with CF in a fashion similar to the cat's audiogram and, for low- and medium-SR fibers, matched those for AI neurons. Minimum latency decreased with increasing SR and CF. As in AI, the standard deviation of first-spike timing (SD) in AN was also an inverse function of maximum acceleration of peak pressure. The characteristics of the increase of SD with latency in a given AN fiber/AI neuron and across AN fibers/AI neurons revealed that the precision of first-spike timing to some stimuli can actually be higher in AI than in AN. The data suggest that the basic characteristics of the latency-acceleration functions of transient onset responses seen in cortex are generated at inner hair cell-AN fiber synapses. Implications for signal processing in the auditory system and for first-spike generation and adaptation in AN are discussed.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The aim of this study was to determine whether an increase in circulating estrogen concentrations would increase percentage pregnant per artificial insemination (PP/AI) in a timed AI protocol in high-producing lactating dairy cows. We analyzed only cows having a synchronized ovulation to the last GnRH of the Ovsynch protocol (867/1,084). The control group (n = 420) received Ovsynch (GnRH – 7 d – PGF 2α – 56h – GnRH – 16h – timed AI). The treatment group (n = 447) had the same timed AI protocol with the addition of 1mg of estradiol-17β (E2) at 8h before the second GnRH injection. Ovarian ultrasound and blood samples were taken just before E2 treatment of both groups. In a subset of cows (n = 563), pressure-activated estrus detection devices were used to assess expression of estrus at 48 to 72h after PGF 2α treatment. Ovulation was confirmed by ultrasound 7 d after timed AI. Treatment with E2 increased expression of estrus but overall PP/AI did not differ between E2 and control cows. There was an interaction between treatment and expression of estrus such that PP/AI was greater in E2-treated cows that showed estrus than in E2-treated or control cows that did not show estrus and tended to be greater than control cows that showed estrus. There was evidence for a treatment by ovulatory follicle size interaction on PP/AI. Supplementation with E2 improved PP/AI in cows ovulating medium (15 to 19mm) but not smaller or larger follicles. The E2 treatment also tended to improve PP/AI in primiparous cows with low (≤2.5) body condition score, and in cows at first postpartum service compared with Ovsynch alone. In conclusion, any improvements in PP/AI because of E2 treatment during a timed AI protocol appear to depend on expression of estrus, parity, body condition score, and size of ovulatory follicle.",

    "title": "IL-4 and IL-13 upregulate arginase I expression by cAMP and JAK/STAT6 pathways in vascular smooth muscle cells.",
    "abstract": "The objectives of this study were to determine whether rat aortic smooth muscle cells (RASMC) express arginase and to elucidate the possible mechanisms involved in the regulation of arginase expression. The results show that RASMC contain basal arginase I (AI) activity, which is significantly enhanced by stimulating the cells with either interleukin (IL)-4 or IL-13, but arginase II (AII) expression was not detected under any condition studied here. We further investigated the signal transduction pathways responsible for AI induction. AI mRNA and protein levels were enhanced by addition of forskolin (1 microM) and inhibited by H-89 (30 microM), suggesting positive regulation of AI by a protein kinase A pathway. Genistein (10 microgramg/ml) and sodium orthovanadate (Na(3)VO(4); 10 microM) were used to investigate the role of tyrosine phosphorylation in the control of AI expression. Genistein inhibited, whereas Na(3)VO(4) enhanced the induction of AI by IL-4 or IL-13. Along with immunoprecipitation and immunoblot analyses, these data implicate the JAK/STAT6 pathway in AI regulation. Dexamethasone (Dex) and interferon (IFN)-gamma were investigated for their effects on AI induction. Dex (1 microM) and IFN-gamma (100 U/ml) alone had no effect on basal AI expression in RASMC, but both reduced AI induction by IL-4 and IL-13. In combination, Dex and IFN-gamma abolished AI induction by IL-4 and IL-13. Finally, both IL-4 and IL-13 significantly increased RASMC DNA synthesis as monitored by [(3)H]thymidine incorporation, demonstrating that upregulation of AI is correlated with an increase in cell proliferation. Blockade of AI induction by IFN-gamma, H-89, or genistein also blocked the increase in cell proliferation. These observations are consistent with the possibility that upregulation of AI might play an important role in the pathophysiology of vascular disorders characterized by excessive smooth muscle growth.",

    "title": "Functional Organization of Auditory Cortex in the Mongolian Gerbil (Meriones unguiculatus). I. Electrophysiological Mapping of Frequency Representation and Distinction of Fields",
    "abstract": "The frequency representation within the auditory cortex of the anaesthetized Mongolian gerbil (Meriones unguiculatus) was studied using standard microelectrode (essentially multiunit) mapping techniques. A large tonotopically organized primary auditory field (AI) was identified. High best frequencies (BFs) were represented rostrally and low BFs caudally along roughly dorsoventrally oriented isofrequency contours. Additional tonotopic representations were found adjacent to AI. Rostral to AI was a smaller field with a complete tonotopic gradient reversed with respect to that in AI (mirror image representation) and was termed the anterior auditory field (AAF). BFs in the range from 0.1 to 43 kHz, apparently covering the hearing range of the Mongolian gerbil, were found in AI and AAF. Units in these two core fields responded to narrow frequency ranges with short latencies. Ventral to the common high‐frequency border to AAF and AI, a rapid transition to very low BFs suggested the presence of a ventral field (V). Caudal to AI two small tonotopically organized fields were identified, a dorsoposterior field (DP) and a ventroposterior field (VP). The VP showed a tonotopic organization mirror imaged to that of AI, i.e. low frequencies were represented rostrally near the caudal border of AI, and high frequencies caudally. The DP showed a concentric frequency organization with high BFs located in the centre. Units in DP and VP fired less strongly, with considerably longer latencies, and responded to a broader range of frequencies than units in AI and AAF. Dorsocaudal to AI a dorsal field (D) was identified, harbouring units that responded to very broad ranges of frequencies. A tonotopic organization of field D could not be discerned. In the border region of AI and D, low‐frequency responses were similar to those found in parts of AI and AAF, but without a clear‐cut tonotopic organization. This region was termed Aid. The two core fields AI and AAF appeared to be located within the koniocortex, while the remaining fields lay outside. Our data show that the organization of the gerbil auditory cortex is highly elaborate, with parcellation into fields as complex as in cat or primates.",

    "title": "Effect of time of insemination on number of accessory sperm, fertilization rate, and embryo quality in nonlactating dairy cattle.",
    "abstract": "Two experiments were conducted to determine the effect of insemination time on number of accessory sperm per embryo (ovum), fertilization rate, and embryo quality. Semen was collected from three fertile Holstein bulls and cryopreserved in egg yolk-citrate-glycerol. In experiment 1, cows were continuously monitored for behavioral estrus by the HeatWatch estrous detection system and were artificially inseminated (AI) with one 0.5-ml straw (25 x 10(6) sperm) at the onset of estrus (AI 0 h), 12 h after onset (AI 12 h), or received natural service at 0 h (Nat 0 h) from one of three bulls. From 150 inseminations, 115 embryos and ova (AI 0 h: n = 39; AI 12 h: n = 39; Nat 0 h: n = 37) were recovered 6 or 7 d after insemination. Fertilization rates differed between treatments (AI 0 h: 67%; AI 12 h: 79%; Nat 0 h: 98%). Median accessory sperm per embryo (ovum) also differed (AI 0 h: 1; AI 12 h: 10; and Nat 0 h: 27) and paralleled the fertilization rate. Embryo quality was not affected by insemination time or natural service. In experiment 2, cows received AI at 0, 12, or 24 h (AI 24 h) after the onset of estrus as determined by HeatWatch. From 154 inseminations, 117 embryos and ova (AI 0 h: n = 39; AI 12 h: n = 39; AI 24 h: n = 39) were recovered 6 or 7 d after insemination. Fertilization rates did not differ in experiment 2 (AI 0 h: 66%; AI 12 h: 74%; AI 24 h: 82%); however, a trend toward a higher fertilization rate accompanied AI 24 h. Median accessory sperm values increased from AI 0 h (1) to AI 24 h (4). Embryo quality declined with AI at increasing intervals after onset of estrus, as percentages of excellent and good, fair and poor, and degenerate embryos were as follows: 77, 15, 8; 52, 38, 10; and 47, 19, 34 for the 0-, 12-, and 24-h inseminations, respectively. Results indicate AI 12 h after the onset of estrus provides a compromise between potential fertilization failure (AI 0 h) and embryo failure (AI 24 h), despite increased accessory sperm per embryo (ovum) after AI 24 h. Artificial insemination 12 h after onset of estrus should optimize fertility of dairy cattle through an acceptable fertilization rate, number of accessory sperm per embryo, and desirable embryo quality.",

    "title": "Intrinsic organization of the cat's medial geniculate body identified by projections to binaural response-specific bands in the primary auditory cortex",
    "abstract": "The area of the cat's primary auditory cortex (AI) within which high frequency sounds are represented can be subdivided using functional criteria. Within each subdivision, or “binaural interaction band,” all recorded neurons display similar responses to binaural stimulation. The current study distinguishes the thalamic sources of input to these subdivisions of AI and characterizes the topography within the thalamic projection to each class of bands. The borders of binaural bands in AI were mapped using microelectrode recording with diotic tonal stimulation, then injections of one to three retrograde tracers were introduced into identified bands. Within the ventral division (V) of the medial geniculate body (the major thalamic source of input to AI), the neuronal populations that projected to different classes of binaural bands were strictly segregated from each other. This segregation of class-specific thalamic sources constitutes a laminar organization within an axis of V that is orthogonal to the previously described tonotopic organization. Excitatory/excitatory (EE) binaural neurons in AI were found to be segregated from excitatory/inhibitory (EI) neurons in alternating “bands.” We consistently identified: (1) a ventral pair of rostrocaudally continuous EI and EE bands, (2) a middle area within which the pattern of binaural subdivisions was more variable and within which bands often were discontinuous rostrocaudally, and (3) a dorsal zone (DZ) within which the responses of neurons differed in binaural properties and in frequency specificity from the response patterns that were characteristic of neurons elsewhere in AI. Each EI band apparently derived input that converged from three thickened laminae of cells in V that were oriented approximately horizontally. The most ventral of these laminae encompassed the ovoidal part of V (Vo), suggesting that EI bands are the only recipients in AI of a projection from Vo. All of the EE bands and DZ derived their input from a single continuous structure which included the dorsal two-thirds of the rostral pole of V and a horizontal lamina interposed between the two dorsalmost EI-projecting laminae. Restricted portions of the complex EE-projecting structure in V projected preferentially to particular EE subdivisions of AI. The V- to-AI thalamocortical topography exhibited a high degree of convergence and divergence within the projections to each cortical binaural band and within the projections to each class of bands. These observations indicate that the high frequency representation in AI and its principal thalamic source of input, the ventral division of the medial geniculate body, may be thought of as assemblies of spatially discrete, functionally distinguishable subunits. The significance of this intrinsic organization is discussed in regard to the requirements for analysis of sound stimuli.",

    "abstract": "In 1950, Claude Shannon published his seminal work on how to program a computer to play chess. Since then, developing game-playing programs that can compete with (and even exceed) the abilities of the human world champions has been a long-sought-after goal of the AI research community. In Shannon's time, it would have seemed unlikely that only a scant 50 years would be needed to develop programs that play world-class backgammon, checkers, chess, Othello, and Scrabble. These remarkable achievements are the result of a better understanding of the problems being solved, major algorithmic insights, and tremendous advances in hardware technology.

The advantages of biology for design and testing of AI systems include large amounts of available online data, significant (but incomplete) background knowledge, a wide variety of problems commensurate with AI technologies, clear standards of success, cooperative domain experts, non-military basic research support and percieved potential for practical (and profitable) applications. These considerations have motivated a growing group of researchers to pursue both basic and applied AI work in the domain. More than seventy-five researchers working on these problems gathered at Stanford for a AAAI sponsored symposium on the topic.

    "title": "Basic functional organization of second auditory cortical field (AII) of the cat.",
    "abstract": "The spatial representations of response characteristics to acoustic stimuli within the ventral primary auditory cortex (AI) and the second auditory cortical field (AII) were mapped in the left hemispheres of 14 anesthetized adult cats using closely spaced (200-500 micron) microelectrode penetrations to record cortical responses from small cell clusters. Responses were activated by 200-ms tone bursts (1/s). The obtained response characteristics were l) frequency selectivity, i.e., characteristic frequency (CF) for narrowly tuned responses and center frequency (arithmetic mean of bandwidth 10-15 dB above threshold) for broadly tuned responses; 2) threshold at CF; 3) bandwidth 10 dB above threshold (Q10); 4) binaural interaction class. CF maps. In AI a strictly tonotopically organized CF map was observed with a frequency gradient from high to low along a rostral/caudal axis. At the dorsal end of AII a 0.5- to 1-mm-wide stripe with clear but not strict tonotopic organization was seen, paralleling the organization of AI. In the ventral part of AII a tonotopic organization concordant with AI was found to be still present. However, it was significantly blurred by the strong variability of the CFs, local low-frequency islands, and increasing bandwidth of receptive fields. Q10 maps. In general, narrowly tuned responses were obtained in AI with increasing bandwidth toward the AI/AII border. In AII, broadly tuned responses were usually obtained with a further decrease of the Q10 value along a dorsal/ventral axis. The Q10 at the transition from AI to AII can be described by Q10 = 1.6 X CF0.36 X Q10 in AI is usually higher and Q10 in AII is usually lower than this transition value. Threshold. The sensitivity of AI responses to tonal stimuli was slightly greater than in AII. Across the AI/AII border, a drop in the sensitivity of 10-15 dB was usually observed. The variability in the thresholds of adjacent locations was much higher in AII than in AI. Binaural interaction. Aggregates of neurons with similar binaural properties in ventral AI were \"band\" shaped and ran roughly orthogonal to isofrequency contours. The course of the binaural bands showed major variations with possible interruptions. The most ventral AI band was EI (contralateral excitation, ipsilateral inhibition) in about 70% of the investigated cortices. In AII binaural aggregates had polymorphic shapes. The sizes and principal orientations of these binaural patches varied widely in different cortices.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",

    "title": "Implications for Parkinson ' s Disease",
    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease occurs in approximately one percent of individuals over the age of 55. It is characterized by the presence oftremor, rigidity, and bradykinesia. Pathologically, the hallmark of Parkinson's disease is the progressive degeneration of the dopamine (DA)-containing neurons of the nigrostriatal projection. Neurological deficits associated with the loss of DA neurons do not appear until the degeneration is extensive, presumably due to compensatory properties of the remaining DA neurons and their targets (Bernheimer et ai., 1973; Zigmond et aI., 1984). The mechanism responsible for the degenerative process is not known, although factors such as genetic predisposition and environmental toxins have been proposed to playa role (Agid et aI., 1993). There is also growing evidence that endogenous factors such as oxidative stress and DA itself may contribute to the neurodegenerative process (Cohen, 1983; Agid et aI., 1993; Zigmond et ai., 1992). A role for DA-induced toxicity to DA neurons is supported by several lines of evidence. First, like the neurotoxin 6-hydroxydopamine, DA is an unstable molecule that will oxidize to form reactive oxygen species and quinones (Graham, 1978). Second, the accumulation of the dark pigment neuromelanin in DA-containing cells of the substantia nigra is positively correlated with the susceptibility of these neurons to degradation in Parkinson's disease (Hirsch et ai., 1988; Kastner et aI., 1992). Neuromelanin is the polymerization product of oxidized DA, suggesting that oxidation is occurring within DA-containing neurons. Likewise, free cysteinyl-DA, the cysteine conjugated form of oxidized DA, has been found in DA-rich regions of the brain in a variety of species and used as an index of the rate of DA autoxidation (Fornstedt et aI., 1990a). Levels of free cysteinyl-catechols are increased under conditions known to promote oxidative stress, such as aging (Fornstedt et ai., 1990b) or ascorbate deficiency (Fornstedt and Carlsson, 1991). Third, the exposure of cells to DA, either in vivo or in vitro, has neurotoxic consequences (Graham et aI., 1978; Michel and Hefti, 1990; Filloux and Townsend, 1993).

    "abstract": "Abstract—The absence of the scavenger receptor A (SR-A)-I/II has produced variable effects on atherosclerosis in different murine models. Therefore, we examined whether SR-AI/II deficiency affected atherogenesis in C57BL/6 mice, an inbred strain known to be susceptible to diet-induced atherosclerotic lesion formation, and whether the deletion of macrophage SR-AI/II expression would modulate lesion growth in C57BL/6 mice and LDL receptor (LDLR)−/− mice. SR-AI/II–deficient (SR-AI/II−/−) female and male mice on the C57BL/6 background were challenged with a butterfat diet for 30 weeks. No differences were detected in plasma lipids between SR-AI/II−/− and SR-AI/II+/+ mice, whereas both female and male SR-AI/II−/− mice had a tremendous reduction (81% to 86%) in lesion area of the proximal aorta compared with SR-AI/II+/+ mice. Next, to analyze the effect of macrophage-specific SR-AI/II deficiency in atherogenesis, female C57BL/6 mice were lethally irradiated, transplanted with SR-AI/II−/− or SR-AI/II+/+ fetal liver cells, and challenged with the butterfat diet for 16 weeks. In a separate experiment, male LDLR−/− mice were reconstituted with SR-AI/II−/− or SR-AI/II+/+ fetal liver cells and challenged with a Western diet for 10 weeks. No significant differences in plasma lipids and lipoprotein profiles were noted between the control and experimental groups in either experiment. SR-AI/II−/−→C57BL/6 mice, however, had a 60% reduction in lesion area of the proximal aorta compared with SR-AI/II+/+→C57BL/6 mice. A similar level of reduction (60%) in lesion area was noted in the proximal aorta and the entire aorta en face of SR-AI/II−/−→LDLR−/− mice compared with SR-AI/II+/+→LDLR−/− mice. These results demonstrate in vivo that SR-AI/II expression has no impact on plasma lipid levels and that macrophage SR-AI/II contributes significantly to atherosclerotic lesion formation.",

    "abstract": "[alpha]-Amylase inhibitor ([alpha]AI) protects seeds of the common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris) against predation by certain species of bruchids such as the cowpea weevil (Callosobruchus maculatus) and the azuki bean weevil (Callosobruchus chinensis), but not against predation by the bean weevil (Acanthoscelides obtectus) or the Mexican bean weevil (Zabrotes subfasciatus), insects that are common in the Americas. We characterized the interaction of [alpha]AI-1 present in seeds of the common bean, of a different isoform, [alpha]AI-2, present in seeds of wild common bean accessions, and of two homologs, [alpha]AI-Pa present in seeds of the tepary bean (Phaseolus acutifolius) and ([alpha]AI-Pc in seeds of the scarlet runner bean (Phaseolus coccineus), with the midgut extracts of several bruchids. The extract of the Z. subfasciatus larvae rapidly digests and inactivates [alpha]AI-1 and [alpha]AI-Pc, but not [alpha]AI-2 or [alphha]AI-Pa. The digestion is caused by a serine protease. A single proteolytic cleavage in the [beta] subunit of [alpha]AI-1 occurs at the active site of the protein. When degradation is prevented, [alpha]AI-1 and [alpha]AI-Pc do not inhibit the [alpha]-amylase of Z. subfasciatus, although they are effective against the [alpha]-amylase of C. chinensis. [alpha]AI-2 and [alpha]AI-Pa, on the other hand, do inhibit the [alpha]-amylase of Z. subfasciatus, suggesting that they are good candidates for genetic engineering to achieve resistance to Z. subfasciatus.",

    "title": "Decision Analysis and Expert Systems",
    "abstract": "Decision analysis and knowledge-based expert systems share some common goals. Both technologies are designed to improve human decision making; they attempt to do this by formalizing human expert knowledge so that it is amenable to mechanized reasoning. However, the technologies are based on rather different principles. Decision analysis is the application of the principles of decision theory supplemented with insights from the psychology of judgment. Expert systems, at least as we use this term here, involve the application of various logical and computational techniques of AI to the representation of human knowledge for automated inference. AI and decision theory both emerged from research on systematic methods for problem solving and decision making that first blossomed in the 1940s. They even share a common progenitor, John von Neumann, who was a coauthor with Oscar Morgenstern of the best-known formulation of decision theory as well a key player in the development",

    "title": "Patterns of cortico‐cortical connections related to tonotopic maps in cat auditory cortex",
    "abstract": "Topographic distributions of cortico‐cortical projections from the primary (AI), anterior (A), posterior (P), ventroposterior (VP), and second (AII) auditory fields were studied in relation to tonotopic maps in combined anatomical and electrophysiological experiments. Distributions of axon terminals were determined by autoradiographic labeling with tritiated proline and leucine. Each of fields A, AI, P, and VP is connected with the other three in the same hemisphere as well as with a number of other auditory cortical areas. Additionally, neurons in each of the fields studied were found to project to the lateral bank of the collateral fissure. In general, regions near the injection site receive more densely labeled projections than do more distant targets. Neurons in each field were found to project to one or more areas in the opposite hemisphere. Only similar portions of the best‐frequency representations in fields A, AI, P, and VP are interconnected. A single isotope injection generally produced multiple patches of labeling within each of several cortical fields. Within AI, projections from contralateral fields A and AI and from ipsilateral fields A and P terminate in patches which are often elongated in a direction parallel to the low‐to‐high best‐frequency gradient. A divergence in the projections from one field upon another is apparent in many experiments. Within fields A, AI, P, and VP, patches of label are distributed along a band of cortex oriented parallel to isofrequency lines.",
